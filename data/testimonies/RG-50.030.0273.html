<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your family and your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I was an only child. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My parents got married pretty late in life and -- and our life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Penslo</span> was my early childhood what was quite normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">We had a sizable <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Penslo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">There were a number of Jewish families. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">We had a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">synogogue</span> and we, children, later on attended <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Well, when I was six years old I started <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> and after four years of <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> I was awarded a scholarship to a <span class="BUILDING">lyceum</span> and an all girls academic high school, but before my first year there was over my scholarship was revoked and I was notified that we would no longer welcome at that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">So all -- because I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And --
QUESTION:  What year was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  It was in 1943 -- 1934. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">It was in 1934 and already at that time the anti-semitism in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Penslo</span> was quite wide spread as it was in many smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Now, what kind of business was your father in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  My father was, what you would probably call a commercial artist. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">He mainly concentrated on designs for embroidery. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">In those days there were a lot of fancy embroidery of table clothes and linen and everything and that was his main occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And -- Q: Was your lifestyle fairly comfortable?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  Our lifestyle was -- yes, was a middle -- middle class Jewish family. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We lived quite comfortably and in the beginning in my early childhood everything was all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Then when I had to leave the special <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I was forced to go back to the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> which in those days public education lasted for eight years and I graduated in 1937 at the age of 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Because there were no opportunity of me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Penslo</span> my parents sent me to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish household school</span> in the suburbs of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> which was actually to learn all kinds of domestic skills including child care. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">During that year my parents moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> into an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Because life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Penslo</span> had become intolerable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  Let me ask you a question before you go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Did -- was your family religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">My family was actually not religious as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">My father especially was a stanch (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="28">cellar (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Jew who would fight for his Judaism any chance he would get. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">See, in those years Jews were already taunted a lot, being called names and even physically pushed around and my father would go out at night with his snappy walking stick and when somebody would taunt him or he would come across a young Nazi boy he would try to hit them with his cane which sometimes got him into trouble and my mother was always worried about him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  I'm trying to get a sense of just the build up on the anti-semitism and whether this was a fact of life before Hitler came to power and how it progressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  It was already before Hitler came to power. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">There were already signs of anti-semitism and then when Hitler came to power, as I said, in 1934 most of the men had joined the Nazi party. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">The youngsters were in the Hitler youth and they had horrast us Jews quite a bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  In what way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Well, they would call us names. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">They sometimes would push me around in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and out. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">They were belittling us and, you know, it was not too pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I mean, some of the Gentiles, I had some Gentile girlfriends, but later on when they joined the Hitler youth they were so brainwashed against Jews that former friends would not dare to associate with a Jew any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Because in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , you know, everybody knew everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">It was different in a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jovian</span> (ph.).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  How did you make sense of it? </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Did you talk about it with your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  Yes, certainly we talked with my parents also with other youngsters. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">You know, we were talking about these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">About -- they were invisible because, you know, the Nazis got stronger and stronger and life became more difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  Did your parents have any lose of in their life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">We had -- we were desperately trying to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And my parents really never had a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">We had no relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> who could have sent us an affidavit or any place else where we could have gotten us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">The only possibilities for my parents were either to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> which my father was afraid he would not tolerate the climate because he was suffering from athsma. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Then my parents at least wanted me to get out and I had a fairly good chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">The director of the <span class="BUILDING">household school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> had immigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and she opened a <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">She sent papers to some of us young girls to come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and work with her in the <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> , but somehow the papers meant for me got lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I have a feeling they must have been sold to somebody and by the time the director was able to make out new papers it, unfortunately, was too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So in 1938 when I came back from <span class="BUILDING">household school</span> and moved in with my parents again the persecution of Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> had become quite bad already and then later on we were forced to wear the Jewish star. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">We had to take the added first names of Sarah and Isreal. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Doctors, lawyers and other professionals could no longer attend to their professions. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Jews were not allowed in the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">In fact, already in '39 we were not allowed to go to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , to the opera, the movies even. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So our life was very limited for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  What -- were you -- did you see a lot of difficulties in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> or round ups, anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  Well, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">happened on November 9, 1938 and I saw the destruction of Jewish business’ and <span class="BUILDING">Jewish homes</span> and there was terrible vandalism and it was just a horrible sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Fortunately, somehow they missed our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and we were not directly affected by that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Did you hear it happen at the ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Well, heard what went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">We also, you know, if you lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was pretty close to the <span class="BUILDING">sports palace</span> in which Hitler frequently spoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So right near our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we had these parades of Hitler and his whole enteras coming around quite frequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">That was about what happened in those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">You know --
QUESTION:  Did you feel at risk when you saw these parades come on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  Well, you were always at risk especially, you know, once we start wearing the Jewish star, but -- well, fortunately, I -- I, personally, my parents, we were never really bothered too much by that. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I mean, we could not associate with Gentiles anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">In fact, one of my father's brothers had been married to a Gentile woman for years. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">In fact, he had converted to Christianity and the brothers could not see each other because they were afraid to be seen with Jews because --
QUESTION:  This is a bit of a digression, but what happened to that brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  That brother survived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  As a Christian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  As a Christian which was unusual because I know of other people where one spouse was Jewish and the other spouse had to suffer for it and also was reported, so that was quite unusual.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Was there, kind of an inward growth of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> because you were so isolated from the rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Ina way it was, of course, you know, we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> late, so we really didn't have too many friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">We had relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and on the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> I had an aunt who had a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> in a beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> where I actually had spent a lot of my school vacation when we still lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Penslo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And my mother had sisters in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and some of us were together mostly with family and relatives in -- in <span class="REGION">Jewish France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  Was -- I mean, were there ever by the Jewish community to kind of take care of -- take care of each other?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  Yes, there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">You know, the Jewish community set up a lot of opportunities for us Jews especially us Jewish youngsters. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">For instance, in 1940 I found out that the Jewish community had established some dress making courses and I enrolled in one of these courses. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Unfortunately I could not quite finish it because before the end of it I was ordered to force labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">That was in April of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And the forced labor I had to do was in a large commercial laundry on the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I had quite a lengthy train ride getting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">At that time the war in Europe was on and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British bombers</span> would come over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> practically every night and bomb <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So we, Jewish, forced labors worked on the four p.m. to midnight shift and we had to sort dirty laundry for the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Well, on my way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after midnight I was usually caught in an air raid on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> at the Neil (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="97">station and sometimes I didn't get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> till eight, nine o'clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">That's how long the air raid lasted. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Once in a while I would just make it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and immediately had to go into our <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> which was set up as an <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelter</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  Was the work hard?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Yeah, well, we had to work hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">You know, dirty laundry e had somebody standing over us to see that we -- we didn't sit still. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">We really worked all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  I want to ask you to go back a minute because --
ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  -- before you had mentioned to me that as a school girl --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  -- there was a lot of anti-semitism in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  Can you tell me --
ANSWER:  Well, I'll tell you for instance I had a primary teacher in my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> who was a stanch in the semite (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="109">and she always preached anti-semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Hatred for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And of course that dropped off on the young students who already were in the Hitler youth and were indoctrinated anyway and therefore made life miserable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  Was she mean to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  She was -- no, she always made an exception of me because she had known my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">One of my father's sisters had been a teacher years earlier together with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So she was familiar with my family and she always said "Well, of course there are exception and Isle is one of these exceptions, but in general, all Jews are bad and all Jews are doing bad things," and this was the jist of her story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  Was that a relief to you that you were an exception?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  No, I felt terribly embarrassed by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Especially there was another Jewish girl in my class who was of course was meant by all this insinuations and it made me feel very bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  Is there anymore, in a detail you can give me about the persecutions or what you saw and heard in -- in -- in the atmosphere in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> before you were deported?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  Well, you know, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> we really kept pretty much to ourselves except, you know, getting together with our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">There really wasn't much contact with the Gentile population. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">They were to stay from us anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And well, you saw that very often even before the pro bone of 1938 that a Jewish source would be vandalized and <span class="BUILDING">Jewish homes</span> , you know, they were -- painted swastikas on them and, in general, these were the things that stand out in my mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Did people continue going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Yes, people did go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  So that wasn't totally restricted?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  No, that was one thing that was not restricted at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  And your father continued to work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  Um, my father, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">My father only got permission to move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> under the regulation that he would not work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">That he could not make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Actually, we had to live on the pension and some papers, you know, treasury papers or things like that that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So that he could not work anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  How -- did your family have friends or did they have any sense of what was coming?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We definitely had a feeling that we wanted to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> desperately. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I think I mentioned that before that we didn't have a chance to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Yeah, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">My mother, she was very a pestimate person, pessimistic, and then the news of the pertration (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="140">started to come about. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">She suggested that we should commit suicide together because we would never survive any kind of deprecation (ph.), </span><span class="sentence" id="142">but I sort of talked her out of it and said "Oh, you'd be surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We will manage. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We will live through it," and I still had hoped that it wouldn't be quite as bad as the -- as she had anticipated. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So then while I was doing the forced labor and that laundry in January of 1942, the beginning of January, we got a notice that we would be resettled to the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">They did not mention where to, just to the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And we were suppose to pack our clothing, bedding, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kerosene heater</span> , and possibly <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machine</span> which I had of course and which we packed, we packed all these things and never saw any of it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Then on January 11, 1942 the German secret police came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and took us away and they sealed off our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which most likely later on was plundered. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">They took us to a <span class="BUILDING">gathering place</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> where a whole group was assembled for this transport which consisted of 1,037 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Mostly middle aged and older people. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Very few young ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">My mother discovered one young girl by the name of Stella. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">She introduced me to her and we befriended each other and went to the first part of the diplocation together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  But did they tell you when you got there anything more about where you were going or what was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  No, they just said "To the east." </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We would be sent to the east to work there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  Were they polite?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Not too polite. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I mean, they just out right told us we would be resettled to work in the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Then we stayed in that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> of two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">We slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of course, being that many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And on the 13th of January the Jewish communities made sandwiches for us to take along on the trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And on the 13th we were put aboard an old, unheated <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for our trip east.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  What was the general mood like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Well, we were all quite depressed of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And on -- on this old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Our mood became more somber and it was really bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">It was so cold that even the drinking water froze. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">My father was not able to take his asthma medication which had kept him asthma free for several years before and he suffered his first asthma attack on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lega</span> (ph.). </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Then the arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lega</span> after four days on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">We arrived at the Skiatave (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="172">freight station outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lega</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And we were told by the SS that there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> available for the transport to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> which was seven kilometers away, but there were not enough <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Just for the older and infirm people and everybody people would have to walk those seven kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">So my father got upon the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and my mother was first standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> next to me and then she suddenly said "You know, your father might have difficulty understanding orders the SS might give him," because he was somewhat hard of hearing from an accident in his childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So she left my side and got up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with my father and that was the last time I ever saw my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I was barely 19 years old at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So the rest of the group of us marched towards the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">The seven kilometers as I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">It was 40 degrees below zero. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">The snow was very deep and it was very difficult to march those seven kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I was luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Before we were deported a relative had given me <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ski boats</span> and I was wearing these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ski boats</span> all through my time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Summer and winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Um, so here every time, you know, somebody slowed down a little bit on the march, the SS would use their rifle butts and kick them in the rear to turn them on until we finally made it to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  And when you got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> did anyone ask "Where's my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Where's my grandfather?"</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  Oh, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">The first thing I did was frantically look for my parents and so did all the other people who had left parents on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> never arrived at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">We were told by the SS that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> had been taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dunamenda</span> (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="192">for the people to work at the <span class="BUILDING">canning factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And, in fact, there was no such thing as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dunamenda</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were taken directly into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> which we found out only later and the people had to strip and were shoot into open <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">All this, of course, we found out later. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Meanwhile, we settled down in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> or <span class="BUILDING">shacks</span> that were assigned to us because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was in the worse slum area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lega</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lega</span> , actually, was a beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but this was in a very bad <span class="REGION">area</span> and it had occupied by the Leucoline (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="197">troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leucoline ghetto</span> before we Germans arrived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So --
QUESTION:  They weren't there anymore?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">ANSWER:  No, there was nobody -- yes, there were some out of -- we found out, we were told that out of 34,000 Leucoline Jews, who had lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leucoline ghetto</span> were all murdered except for 4,000 young men who had occupations that were important to the war effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And they were separated from us German Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">They were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leucoline ghetto</span> what we called in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German ghettos</span> , separated by <span class="DLF">wire fences</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">There were some <span class="DLF">gates</span> in the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and on weekends the Leucoline Jews men would sometimes get permission to come over to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German ghetto</span> and visit with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And they all told us that they had all lost their entire families. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">That they all had been killed before the first German transport arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">In fact, we were told that the first German transport in November of 1941, and when they came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> there was still -- there was still food in the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> and on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">The sign that the previous occupants must have just left before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  But when you got there it was --
ANSWER:  When we got there, no, there were several transports before ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was separated into different groups from different parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and also from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and some from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Each had their own <span class="REGION">area</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And each <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had their own tempt elders and the chief of labor assignments which were Jews that were assigned to do the selection for the outside labor detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">QUESTION:  So -- so the real <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was divided. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">There were various communities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">ANSWER:  Yeah, I mean, we were all together, but different -- in different <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">In fact, the <span class="DLF">streets</span> were named after the <span class="REGION">area</span> where we had come from. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">There was Berlina Strasusa (ph.), </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Cologne (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Street and all these various, you know, we gave them the names of the people who were living there now from German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">QUESTION:  Did all of the people that were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German ghetto</span> get along or that you communicated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And in the beginning in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , families were still allowed to be together which was a good thing and didn't last all too long because every few weeks there would be a selection -- oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">When we first go there I was assigned to shoveling snow in the sleet of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lega</span> for the whole winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">That was an assignment. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">In the morning we would be escorted out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to the place of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">In the evening we would be escorted back and always in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> they had gallows set up. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And we were always led by the gallows and usually there was a corpse hanging there. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Being hanged because they had bartered for some food on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> which was strictly forbidden.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  I'm afraid we are going to run out of the tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">The Leucoline Jews had pretty bad feelings toward us German Jews of course because all their families had been murdered to make room for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And they had lost everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">So -- but
QUESTION:  Was there tension between you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  Well, I personally didn't notice that much tension. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Maybe, in general, I didn't notice 1t too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Um, these work details, the outside work details, went on, you know, these work details had to do with the war effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">You know, working for the German army and the -- and the war industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And some assignments were reversed and others, they were always selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Every few weeks we would be assembled and sent either to the right <span class="NPIP">side</span> or left <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">One <span class="NPIP">side</span> meant being marked for extermination. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">The other <span class="NPIP">side</span> meant being selected for work detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">QUESTION:  Did you know that at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">We -- not right in the beginning and then later on, of course, we realized what was happening every time there was a selection and we didn't see those people anymore that had been sent to the one <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So we had a pretty good idea that they had been sent to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> too and -- and shot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  Did you think when you first got that that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> had been cleared specifically for you in therefore you would be safe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  I don't know if we really felt that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">It seemed that way, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">It seemed that way, but we were all pretty much in the same predicament. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">We all had to work and as long as we were able to work and be of help to the Germans we were -- we would be aloud to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Otherwise that was the end of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  Well, you were talking about -- about the selections --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  -- that I think you learned --
ANSWER:  Yeah, we learned pretty fast that the people who had been sent to one <span class="NPIP">side</span> would be sent to their death. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">That they were being taken to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and also shoot into the open <span class="DLF">graves</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit more about how the ghetto bureaucracy was set up and what people's responsibilities were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  Well, like I said before, there was -- first of all, was the SS ghetto comman. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Then all his under links, all our guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">They selected German Jews from each <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to serve as group elders or as chief of labor assignments and they -- that was their responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And that was about as far as it went. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">You know --
QUESTION:  Did they -- were they respected by the --
ANSWER:  Oh, there was also ghetto police. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Some of our young Jewish men had to man the <span class="DLF">gates</span> that were separating the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and were used as our own internal police.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">QUESTION:  You were talking about the people who guard the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> you say SS.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">ANSWER:  Yeah, when I saw SS I meant the German SS as well as the Leucoline SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And frankly the Leucoline SS were even worse then the German SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">They took -- they were real anti-semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">They took their jobs very seriously and, you know, they were, besides the hangings, the regular hangings of people who had bothered for food -- by the way, the first transports that had come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , when they first came into the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> they found that the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> had been pretty much plundered. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">They had been destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">All of the valuables had been taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">But once in awhile hidden away some <span class="NPIP">place</span> we would discover a piece of jewelry or something and then even though we had never gotten our own clothing in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> there was a <span class="BUILDING">clothing depot</span> set up that -- where we issued our clothing and these things were used to bother on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">A piece of bread or whatever we could get. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Because you could not live on the food rations we got in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">We were given 200 grams of bread a day issued once a week and potatoes and old cabbage leaves and fish heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And once in a great while a small portion of horse meat which was a great treat. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So as I said, you had to supplement your food through outside bartering. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Otherwise you could not exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So you had to take your chances of being hanged. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Sometimes one of our SS commendans would shoot people on the spot besides the hangings. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So we had shootings and hangings all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">QUESTION:  Who were you bartering with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">ANSWER:  With the Leucoline Gentiles that we met on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">You know, when our guards weren't looking or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And they knew all ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">They would see us day after day and they would know that we had something to give them and they brought us some bread or something edible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  Did you ever talk to someone on what was going on when they --
ANSWER:  No, we couldn't really. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">First of all, we didn't know the Leucoline language. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">See, and in that respect, the Leucoline Jews, the few surviving Leucoline Jews were better off. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">They knew -- knew the language and also some of them escaped from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and joined the Protestants because they were able to speak the language and they could go in the <span class="REGION">country side</span> and meet farmers and some of them got away with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And later on we found out that they were working with the Protestants.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  But none of you were able to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">ANSWER:  No, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">One of the Leucoline fellows once suggested I should -- he would escape and I should come with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And I said it would be out of the question because we would certainly be found out because I don't speak the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So I turned that offer down.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">QUESTION:  Where did you live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">ANSWER:  Well, at first, as I said, we lived with the group that we had come with from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Some <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were literally like three story <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Others were just <span class="BUILDING">shacks</span> , but all of them had <span class="BUILDING">outhouses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">You know, they had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So -- well, life was still bearable because as I said, families were still together except for those who had been singled out and -- during the selections. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">This came later on that the families were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">In the summer of 1942, that was the first summer there, there was another selection and 50 young girls including my girlfriend Stella who I met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , we were selected for a work detail at the Baltic (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="302">seashore. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">This was the best assignment ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">We had to fix up formally Jewish homes, Nazi confiscated estates that were suppose to be made ready for recreation places for high SS officials and high German officials to come there for the -- during the summer for their recreation. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">We were housed in the, what formally must have been <span class="INT_SPACE">servants quarters</span> and we had no water -- unfortunately we had no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">We couldn't was ourselves or bath. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">So at night after dark the SS would take us to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Baltic sea</span> to wash ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">We got our food from a soup kettle. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Thia was the most obstrensed (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="310">soup than the food we had had in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , so we could easily survive on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We got bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">One man had been taken along from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> besides us 50 girls who operated the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">soup kettles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">So then we girls also cleaned the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> for the occupants. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I, myself, had the gardening detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So as I said, this was a very good assignment. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">You know, we weren't beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">We weren't arrested much. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Yes, we were under observation of the S, but they pretty much left us alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">QUESTION:  How were you chosen for this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">ANSWER:  Well, the commandant must have looked over us young girls and who ever suited his fancy he thought we would do for that assignment. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So I befriended five of the girls on this labor detail and we decided that once we would get back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> we would try to move together. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Where as, you know, they all had been from different districts in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and we had all lived in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">So after the summer was over we got back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and our life went on as usual in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">We went on our work assignments and as usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Then in -- yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">QUESTION:  What other work assignments now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">ANSWER:  Well, you know something. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">It's really not clear in my mind anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">It all had to do with the army, with the, you know, fixing up uniforms for the army and shipments, doing shipping and pretty- some work was very hard and we were very much abused by our captures. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Others were not quite as difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">You know, they were a little more lenient and so that was a little easier to handle. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">But all this time our life was in constant danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">First of all because of the bartering and a chance of being hanged or shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And secondly, because of the constant selections. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">We were afraid to get sick, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Which happened to me and -- in the early fall of 1943 I got very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I got jaundice and hepatitis. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And I was put into the <span class="BUILDING">ghetto hospital</span> which was set up instead by a German inmate doctors and nurses who were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">There weren't many medications available for us, but over some weeks I got better. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Never really regained my strength, but they discharged me after several weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">But I was too week to go on outside assignments, so I -- oh, by this I forgot to mention. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">When we had gotten back, the six girls from the -- from the work commander at the Baltic sea, we did move together into a very old <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> at the end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that had been unoccupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">So we were under the jurisdiction of the Colon group. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So now, when I wasn't able to out on outside work detail I talked to the chief of the labor assignment and told him of my predicament and he said "Oh, I tell you what. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">You can help my older daughter Lilly who has to take care old my six young children because my wife goes <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to work to bring in some food for the family." </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Well, this for me was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I enjoyed being with the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I enjoyed being with a family because I hadn't had a family in all this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I lived with my friends there in the, you know, in the <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> , but the daytime I spent with my friends there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">QUESTION:  This just brings up a question before you were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">There were a lot of children in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">ANSWER:  Yes, at that time there still were a lot of children until later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">QUESTION:  Were there activities for the kids?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  Yes, they did have activities for the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I'm really not too clear on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I think they did have some schooling and some play groups, you know, where older youngsters took care of the young children. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And I'm really not too clear anymore, but there were some activities for the children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">QUESTION:  Were there activities for the rest of the people? </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Were there vocational courses or was there religious activities? </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Was there any culture?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">ANSWER:  Well, any religious activities would have to be held in the various <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">You know, there was no -- no <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> -- nothing of that kind and they were held in secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Services were held, you know, there were some Orthodox Jews there who held services in their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and invited some other Orthodox people to participate in them. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">I understand that there once in awhile was a concert. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">You know, I was never part of it and I really wasn't personally there. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">But I've heard that once in awhile there were some performances. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">You know, some of our ghetto inmates still had some, I don't know how they managed to get instruments unless they found them in -- when they got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">You know, left behind by the Laclians. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">It's quite possible because everything had been taken away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">You know, any kind of jewelry had been taken away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Also, fur coats. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Everything, you know, and that was all sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for, you know, for use there. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And, you know, as I said, e never saw any of our own clothing anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Only, you know, if it happened to be in the <span class="BUILDING">clothing depot</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">QUESTION:  So what -- after you came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from work in the evening what did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">ANSWER:  Well, we had --
QUESTION:  I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">One second.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">ANSWER:  Well, in the evenings of course we cooked our meals from the meager rations that we had and sat around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dinner table</span> and had conversations. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">We had found some books in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> from the Leucoline Jews we were reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">But we went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> pretty early because we worked very hard and we were very tired.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">QUESTION:  Do you remember any of those conversations and the types of things you would talk about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">ANSWER:  Well, actually, we reminisced more about our childhood and about the good times than we wanted to dwell on the hard times that we had there. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Which actually became worse later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Well, anyway, while I was helping my friend Lilly to take care of these younger children I had a relapse of my hepatitis and the jaundice and I was taken back to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">This was in the later fall of 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> again for several weeks and improved to some extent, but really not enough to be discharged. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">So one day my girlfriend Lilly who had visited me regularly at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , came by . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">There was no visiting time and she called me at the <span class="DLF">window</span> and said to me "I'm very glad to hear that you're coming out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> tomorrow." </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Well, I understood immediately what that message meant and I told the doctor, the chief doctor in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , that I would be leaving the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> the next day and he said "Not with my permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">You are in no condition to be released from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I said "With or without your permission I'm leaving." </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And so here I was barely able to stand on my feet, but I left the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">It so happened that Lilly's father, the chief of labor details, had gotten wind of the fact that there would be a -- that the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> would be evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">All these people would be sent away to their deaths and that's why he had told his daughter to warn me of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So I came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">This was in November of '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I came out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and sure enough a few days later the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> population was taken out and put to death, but all the other ghetto inmates had to stand for selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And this time not only were the infirm people taken away, all the older ones who were left and there were not many of them, but mothers with young children. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">All young children were put to one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and we were asked at what <span class="NPIP">places</span> we had worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And I of course have not -- having not had worked on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , lied that I had been working at the Aviar (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="401">which was the <span class="BUILDING">army clothing depot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Otherwise, it would have meant death for me too. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And luckily I got away with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I was put- put on the right <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">So all these mothers with the young children got taken away that time to their death.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">QUESTION:  When you say that the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was evacuated --
ANSWER:  Yeah, well --
QUESTION:  -- did you know where these people were -- I mean, what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="407">How did you know what was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">ANSWER:  Well, we had a pretty fairly good idea that it didn't mean anything good. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">That they were meant for death because, you know, there were previous selections in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="410">So we had a fairly good idea and my girlfriend Lilly actually saved my life by getting me out there in time. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Otherwise, I certainly wouldn't be around anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">So now, this meant, this was November '43, that meant the end of the Steliga (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="413">ghetto. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">All the ghetto inmates that were left were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kisavold</span> (ph.), </span><span class="sentence" id="415">outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lega</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And some of them stayed there for work details there. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Most of us were sent to outside installations where we were housed at our <span class="BUILDING">work places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">So I was sent to this Aviar (ph.), </span><span class="sentence" id="419">to the <span class="BUILDING">army clothing depot</span> where we were housed in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that had double or triple <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> where we slept and we were given a mesket (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="420">and a <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span> and we worked there taking care of the clothing for the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Sorting it. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Shipping it out and all these things connected with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">QUESTION:  How many of you were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">ANSWER:  You know, I don't really recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">There were quite a few of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Maybe a 100. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I'm really not sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  You weren't in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Kisserwal</span> (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="429">were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  No, I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">We were only processed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Kisserwal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Now, all these outside installations were under the jurisdiction of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Kisserwal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">So the -- the food there, again, we got soup that was made with potato peels and we got some bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">It was sufficient, but just barely so. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">That we could just live on it and do our work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">QUESTION:  Were you with the other girlfriend that you had been living with? </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Did they make it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">In this particular work detail I was not with any of my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">These were all other whom I met in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but nobody that I was really friends with.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">QUESTION:  Were you pretty strong or did you feel --
ANSWER:  Well, I really wasn't strong yet because I hadn't fully recovered from the -- from the jaundice and the hepatitis, so I was quite week yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">But I mustered all my strength and did my work. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Then, this was from November '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">July of '44 we were still working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Even other people had other work, outside detail work details, but all having to do with the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">In July of '44 a delegation came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Kisserwal</span> and Viverman (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="447">had our hair off. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So now we were all bald and we were given prison clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Then in August we were suddenly assembled and taken away from our <span class="BUILDING">work places</span> and we were put on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freighters</span> of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bargers</span> (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="450">you might call them. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bargers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Pressed in like sardines. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">You know, that how many of us were there and we were being shipped out again. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">The conditions on these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bargers</span> were terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I mean, we were just laying one on top of another. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">We barely had a little water to drink and it was just horrible conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Now, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barge</span> I was very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">All of a sudden I found my girlfriend Lilly and two other friends from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , Margaret (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="459">and Gerta who were sisters and who were there with their mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And all of a sudden the four -- the five of us, actually, with the mother, were together and from that moment on the five of us were together until our liberation actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">So we were happy to have found each other on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bargers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">The trip on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barger</span> took three days and took us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">port of Dansic</span> (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="463">or as it was called in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And we were shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Stitof</span> (ph.). </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Now, Stitof --
QUESTION:  How much information -- did you know where you were going or why you were going?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">ANSWER:  No, we had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">They just put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freighter</span> and --
QUESTION:  Had you at this point had any information about the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Did you have a sense of what was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="469">ANSWER:  Well, somehow we sensed that the -- the war was not going to well for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">That's why they kept shipping us from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> and that the Russians must have been coming closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">We sensed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">We didn't really know for sure, but we sensed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So when we saw <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stitof</span> , it was a horrible sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">You know, the <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> were smoking and the smell was like stuck yards. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And we immediately thought that if we had to stay there we would never make it out alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">So --
QUESTION:  What did you see when you went in together, people in there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">ANSWER:  Well, we saw other people behind -- there were different sections in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stitof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">They had different <span class="REGION">areas</span> all separated by <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> where different people from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , I guess, had been assembled. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And luckily we were kept together in one <span class="REGION">area</span> behind <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And we didn't stay there long. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I think we were there only maybe a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Not even a week, so we were very lucky.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">QUESTION:  So you weren't working or anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">ANSWER:  Not at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stitof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">We were sent away to work details. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">So luckily my four girlfriends and the mother and I were selected together. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">We were all together a group of 1,000 women who were sent to the <span class="REGION">Polish country side</span> which had been taken over by the Germans to dig <span class="DLF">trenches</span> for the German army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">QUESTION:  We stopped when you had ride from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stotif</span> to the side, but I wanted to ask you to go back a little bit more to the Raga (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="489">ghetto and maybe tell me a little bit more about the lifestyle in there and whether you had social life, whether you worked everyday, whether you celebrated holidays.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">ANSWER:  Yes, first of all, a lot of the Jewish girls befriended the Leucoline Jews who came over on the weekend to be with -- with us girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And as a matter of fact some -- some of them later on after the liberation married them because, I mean, most of these fellows had been previously married and had lost their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">But we had -- there also were, of course, boyfriends, girlfriends in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German ghetto</span> , you know, that were together and on weekends we enjoyed each others company and the Leucoline fellows would come over and we would socialize together. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">We would get together in groups of two couples, three couples in somebody's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> we would get together. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And, in general, enjoy each others company and enjoy the day off from work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">QUESTION:  Oh, you had a day off.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">ANSWER:  Well, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">We had a day off from work. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">That's on the weekends when the Leucoline Jews also had their day -- day off from work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">QUESTION:  So that you had the freedom to go back and forth between the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Leucoline</span> when the German ;
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">We German Jews were not allowed to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leucoline ghettos</span> and I think the Leucoline fellows had to get special permission to come over to visit in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Which they got quite readily.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">QUESTION:  Did the Leucoline Jews get any kind of favorite treatment in terms of work assignments or freedom?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">ANSWER:  Well, I believe that their work assignments were better because they had special skills that were needed for the war effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Tool makers and whatever other tools they had that came in handy for the war effort and for that reason I believe that they had preferred treatment at work. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Whereas we just were assigned, you know, general labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">QUESTION:  What were the differences between the way men and women were treated. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">How did you feel as a women?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">ANSWER:  No, lots of time we women were treated just as rough as the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Of course, well, some of them might have treated some of the young girls a little bit better, maybe, than they would have men or older women. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Which applies also to the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">You know, some of the German SS sort of favored some of the German girls and saw to it that they had better work assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  Were there girls that you knew who would take great advantage of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  Well, I personally didn't have that experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">I mean, my girlfriend Lilly and Margaret and Gerta and myself, we didn't have that experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">My friend Stella who I had met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> befriended a Leucoline Jew and later on after the liberation she married him. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">But, in general, you know, we girls were together and socialized.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">QUESTION:  And those relationships would be under girls that were important to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">ANSWER:  Oh, very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Very important because you could always rely on them to help you in any situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">QUESTION:  What about -- you mentioned that people might be able to pray in private at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , what about when Jewish holidays arose? </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Were you aware?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">ANSWER:  Well, we Orthodox Jews, of course, tried to observe the Jewish holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">In fact, the Youngkiper (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="524">which wasn't difficult anyhow because we didn't get much to eat in any case. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I remember on Passover people tried to barter for flour instead of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And Lilly's mother, for instance, was able to bring some flour into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and while we of course never given any matza by the Natzis, we managed to bake matza ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Lilly and I for instance, through her father who had talked to some Leucoline Jews and knew that they had some ovens available in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leucoline ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">We sneaked over in the middle of the night with our flour and we baked matza for . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And so her father conducted the seta (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="530">as much as you could. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">You might even have had hagolta (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="532">which you might have found in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leucoline ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">QUESTION:  Was that risky for you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">ANSWER:  Oh, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">We risked our lives by doing it, but then you risk your life everyday. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Even bartering for food or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">So that was nothing unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">You know, we forget everyday could be our last day and we tried not to dwell on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">We dwelled on the past and on better life and were hoping that we might survive and have a better future.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">QUESTION:  Didn't that give you a sense of excitement or pride or something ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">ANSWER:  Yes, it made us happy and proud that we were able to observe a Jewish holiday and even with matza.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">QUESTION:  Ina way that's a form of religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  Oh, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Try to resist. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I mean, there was not much resistance that we could matza in our condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION:  Do you remember the in general?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">We were there for quite some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">No, really nothing too much that I can add to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">QUESTION:  And I want you to pick up now --
ANSWER:  Where we had left off?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">QUESTION:  -- you had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stitof</span> about a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">QUESTION:  And you were housed --
ANSWER:  Well, there were <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> there behind barbed wire and we were assembled. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Like I said, a 1,000 women were picked out for this work detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Not all of us were from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">We had Jewish women there from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Laclia</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lithoania</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istonia</span> (ph.). </span><span class="sentence" id="557">All the three different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">All the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">So here we were in the <span class="REGION">Polish country side</span> assigned to digging the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">We were housed in a wooden <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> with high -- <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Like <span class="BUILDING">circle tents</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Round wooden ply wood tents. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">100 women to each <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> in two layers. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">One layer of straw on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , a plank, a wooden plank, and another layer of straw for the second layer. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">50 on the bottom and 50 on the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">We were each given a horse blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">That's the only way that you can call it and, of course, there was no light, no heat. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">In the beginning it was summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">We would dig our <span class="DLF">ditches</span> and we would all, in the morning, we would first shovel a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> for Margaret and Gerta's mother so that she could sit down in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">green</span> and we warned her when the gaurds were coming closer to look busy and shovel the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">We -- we girls would work harder to make up for her part of the work and we really dug these drenches which became very difficult in the winter because we first had to loosen the ice and snow with pick axes before we even get -- could get at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">We also built barbed -- barriors across the <span class="DLF">road</span> that were suppose to stop the Russian army from advancing. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Now, in our <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> here in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> we were, also we were given very meger rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">We got the soup each day that was made out of potato peels and and cabbage leaves and things like that, and really unsufficient for the work ew were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">So at night, in the dark, we young girls, two at a time, we were four, we would sneak out into the feilds and steal turnips and potatos. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">The turnips we would eat raw and the potatos of course you couldn't eat raw so we once in awhile -- while were able to make a fire and bake some poatos in the fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">We had, occassionally we had SS guards who were a little more leaniant and who looked the other way and let us get away with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">So that was a special treat when we had baked potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">In the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> we -- we were infected with lice and there were mice or rats rustling around under the straw and we'd never forget any of them because as soon as -- as it got light they got away and so we lived with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">People got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">There were so many that died. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">That I think at the end of this work detail out of 1,000 women maybe there were 100 left. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Not more than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">for it and dysentery and they just died off. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I got sick too. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I had -- I had intestinal problems too. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">My legs were covered with open boils that were oozing puss. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And I felt pretty bad, but we got through this and the mother of Margaret and Gerta got through with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And this lasted from August of '44 till January of '45.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">QUESTION:  Had, in this period of time, did you learn anymore about what was going on in the outside world?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">ANSWER:  Yes, we had heard that the war was not going well for the Germans and that the Russians were coming close. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">So in January of 19 -- of 1945 all of a sudden we were assembled and we started on a death march. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">The SS wanted to get us closer back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> towards <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="594">So here we marched. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Had we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lega</span> originally we understand that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lega</span> was liberated in '44 already and I think in October of '44, so many more of us would have stayed alive, but the Nazis always took us a step further closer towards <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and here we were on this death march and marching day and night and all of us were really sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">My girlfriend Margaret was desperately ill at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And, you know, I also had diarea and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And whoever wasn't able to march any further and fell by the bay side would get shot by the SS accompanying us in . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">So we marched through several nights, but then one night the SS finally let us stay over night in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">In an empty <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And when we woke up the next morning, I believe it was January 21st of 1945, our SS guards were gone and we were suddenly fee or so we thought, but our joys were short lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">We moved on by the time -- there were just the five of us together. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Maybe a few other women were with us at first, but eventually there were just the five of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">We went on because in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> there was nothing to eat for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">We looked and found another deserted <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> where we moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And the first thing was to kill the chickens and made chicken soup and gave it to our friend Margaret who I'm sure would not have survived another week of marching. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">She was that ill at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And she ate the chicken soup and then we found some canned cherries in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> and she ate a whole jar of the sour cherries and that really cleaned her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And from that day on she started to get better. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Now, two days after the SS had left the Russian soldiers started to march in, but they never really liberated us. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">We were just a handful of women and we told him that we were Jewish and had come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and they wouldn't believe us. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">They kept saying "Nancy," and we were saying "Yes, "| Which means I'm Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">But they didn't believe us. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">They thought we were Gentiles and Nazis ==—=—~—_ and so they were after us. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And also -- they were after us, yeah, the soldiers were after us young girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">They were always trying to rape us and we somehow managed to evade them all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">All four of us managed to get away without being raped, but it was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">We were -- Qo... ——i‘“‘“‘i i,
ANSWER:  We were hiding under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">When we saw them coming we would, on the way, hide <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="DLF">barn yard</span> some <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And the mother would protect the . </span><span class="sentence" id="621">She would try -- try to talk to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">We learned a few word of Russian which I have long since forgotten, but it didn't help us really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">QUESTION:  It must have been frightening for with the Nazis to be liberated and still be fighting for your life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">ANSWER:  Yeah, see we never had any -- we never got any papers because nobody really liberated us. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">It was plain Russian soldiers who marched in. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Who had no authority to give us any papers or who didn't even believe that we were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">So we were suppose to go to a town called in Polish where they had the Russian war commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And the Russian war commandant was suppose to give us instructions what to do further. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Now, we had heard since there were women from the <span class="REGION">Baltic sea</span> among us that women from the <span class="REGION">eastern state</span> would be sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because the war there us over already, but the German Jews would be shipped off to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> because they didn't really the German Jews and, you know, these soldiers must have notified the Russian authorities, so they were constantly after us. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And, so we tried desperately to avoid the soldiers of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nunmark</span> (ph.). </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And we marched around the <span class="REGION">Polish country side</span> looking for one <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> after another and the farmers would sometimes put us up, give us shelter in their <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and we would work or them. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I did some sewing for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">My girlfriend Gerta mending socks for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">The others worked in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> sometimes and so we found one <span class="NPIP">place</span> after the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Sometimes we slept in a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and this went on for five months. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Five months we struggled through this and meanwhile, you know, I always thought coming back to the rapes, attempted rapes, I thought the soldiers would leave me alone because if they would see my legs with all the puss running out of the sores that they wouldn't be interested in me, but that never would have stopped them. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">The only reason we ourself was, you know, being -- hiding away or some other way, but that would have never stopped them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">QUESTION:  Were there any women soldiers or Jewish soldiers around?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">ANSWER:  Occasionally we had a Jewish mentor, but we never say a women soldier, but we had, once in awhile we had a Jewish soldier who, of course, told the others to leave us alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And that also saved us. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">So, you know, after these five months, practically five months, of wandering around <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> sometimes we would be given, you know, they had school lunches and they would give us some milk and potatoes to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">You know, and other times the farmers would give us food for work that we did for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So by this time we not only had the Russian authorities after us, but we also had the Polish militia (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="644">who was looking for us too. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And, you know, the Polish, they are the greatest anti-semitist. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">They are known for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">So by this time we already figured it didn't make any difference anymore who would catch us. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">The Russians or the Poles, we had to take a chance and go to . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">So we did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Came to and we were lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">The day we arrived there the Russian war commidant was not there and his under link did not know the procedure. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Did not know that they should, the Germans, were being moved to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> and didn't know what to do with us, so he told us to go to . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">In we would find the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Now, earlier on our friend Lilly had found a few small pieces of gold on our death march which was also, you know, the <span class="DLF">road</span> was also being used by Nazis who were fleeing when the Russians came closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">So somebody must have lost these pieces of gold and my girlfriend really found them. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">We gave a piece of gold to for our trip to . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">We got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> and that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> never stopped at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in . </span><span class="sentence" id="658">It only slowed down, so we had to jump off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">moving train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="659">We girls helped one another and then we helped the mother off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we made our way to the Red Cross.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">QUESTION:  This was when?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">ANSWER:  This was in June of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And the Red Cross put us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Took care of us for awhile and the mother by this time had a very bad cold and was really sick, but we didn't realize how serious it really was. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">So after we had stayed there for awhile we also went to the side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> which had been demolished by then and after awhile we decided it was time to move on and we wanted to try to get back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="665">So with another piece of gold from Lilly we got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> we were some of the first refugees coming back and they had just set up a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish relief center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And that was opposite the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And Margaret and Gerta's mother was immediately hospitalized. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">She had and even though she got good treatment there she died on us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Which was very sad because after all she had gone through, three years of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , five months of wandering through <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , she made it all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and then past away. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">relief center</span> were located in the British sector of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="671">We met some British soldiers and they gave us money to bury the mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I knew the large Jewish cemetery there and that's where we buried her. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">So meanwhile, we had stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">relief center</span> across from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and because they had just been set up they had nothing really to give us. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">They had no clothing to give us, so they gave us some blue, white checkered blanket covers from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Out of which they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machines</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Out of which I sewed dresses for us four girls and these dresses were -- were all the in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> were our first clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Then after the mother had died some of theses British soldiers found us an -- a nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">There must have been Nazis living there who had fled and well, we made ourselves at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">We took some of the clothing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Then I found my Uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and he told me he wanted me to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> whereas I had intended to go with my girlfriend to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Levitt</span> (ph.), </span><span class="sentence" id="681">but he convinced me that 1t would be better for me to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> since I was entitled to food ration in the Soviet after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And my other benefits were two days where I had , So he rented me a <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span> and the girls tried to get back to their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> in the west. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">On a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British truck</span> , you know, British army. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">But the first time they couldn't make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">They got stopped by the Russians at the boarder and were sent back. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">So all of a sudden they appeared in my <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span> , my <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span> again and we spent two more days together and then they made a second attempt. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">This time the British soldiers hid them among <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they made it to the west. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">They made it to Margaret and Gerta's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which was still found intact in their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And our friend Lilly stayed with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">So we were always in contact with one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I had to find myself a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I had to earn a living and I absolutely did not want to work for any Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">I figured they were all Nazis and I'm certainly not going to work for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And I managed to find myself a job with the American army that was stationed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> where I had my furnished <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I got a job there in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">That was the quarter master's supply people where all the American troops were supplied that were stationed all around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And I was in charge of the supply.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">QUESTION:  ,
ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">QUESTION:  You had gotten a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> with the American army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">At this <span class="BUILDING">army base</span> I was the only Jewish girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">All the other girls were Nazi girls who had befriended American soldiers and who got them into this job. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">So --
QUESTION:  What did that seem like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">ANSWER:  It didn't make me feel very good, but that's the way it was and I found there was one Jewish man at the base who was playing the accordion and the piano for the soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And he came over to me one day and said "Are you the Jewish girl that just returned from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">It's the talk of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that there's a Jewish girl." </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I said, "That's me. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I'm the one." </span><span class="sentence" id="710">He said "You know, we have quite a few Jewish soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">I'll introduce you." </span><span class="sentence" id="712">So he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">He introduced me to the Jewish soldiers who were really wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I mean, here the soldiers were not suppose to give us anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">You know, us employees at the base, but they always managed to give us, you know, instant coffee and soda and cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And, you know, it was very good because, I mean, all the supplies in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> were very short ration. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">But I could eat at the <span class="BUILDING">army base</span> , but . </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Now, the Jewish soldiers had services Friday night at the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">They took me along for the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">They had asked me if I wanted to go and I said absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I would like to attend a service. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And every Friday night they would take me in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army vehicle</span> and take me to the where we had a Jewish service. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">After the services there was a Jewish family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> who had lived under ground, meaning they had been hidden by German gentiles all during the war and who had come back to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> which had not been destroyed, which, by the way, I found out that the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that my parents and I had lived in was bombed to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="724">You know, when I came back I saw it bombed to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> which made me very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">But not the anti- . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">That was never . </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Anyway, we came to this open <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they always invited all the , you know, refugees or people who had lived under ground and had very interesting discussions group and socializing at their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> every Friday night. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Which made it very pleasant, you know, very nice escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Then in -- when was it -- in April of 1946, you know, me and my other fellows were working at the --
QUESTION:  Where were you living at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">ANSWER:  I had a <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="731">QUESTION:  You were basically alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">ANSWER:  Yes, I was basically alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I had a furnished <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> not too far from the <span class="BUILDING">army base</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">QUESTION:  Did you -- were -- did you have any family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">ANSWER:  No, none, I mean, at that time only later on did I get in contact with my Uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Besides from this Uncle in the Gentile and -- and their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I really didn't have anybody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I befriended the Jewish family who really took in like I was their own child. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">That was also a mixed marriage, but they had suffered persecution. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">The Gentile husband had been taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">So they treated me very well and treated me like family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">QUESTION:  What about your relations with the German people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="743">What kind of response?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="744">ANSWER:  Well, of course, none of them ever admitted that they ever had been Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Of course, there were no more Nazis around, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">As far as that was concerned they all lied, but, of course, every -- every person at the age they could have been Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">You know, I'm sure they were Nazis before and aside from some of the girls that I worked with at the base I really didn't have much contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">As I said, all my spare time I spent with this one Jewish family that had befriended me. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">So one Friday night in April of 1946, this Jewish family told us that they had obtained questionnaires from the American Joint Distribution Committee to apply for visas to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">Unites States</span> for us- for us, mostly girls who had returned and some fellows too. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Some fellows who regularly attended these open <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And I, even though I was not that anxious to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> because I had nobody there, but I knew I couldn't get to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="752">at that time, so I filled out the form to apply for a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And to my greatest surprise, several weeks later I was called to the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> and they questioned -- in fact, I had gotten -- I had just arrived at my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">army base</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">I had not even had my breakfast yet when I received a telegram from the Joint Distribution Committee telling me to come to the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="755">So I immediately went to the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> and I was questioned there the whole day. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">Making sure I was really the person I claimed to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I had by this time, I can show it to you later, I had a little thing like a passport stating I was a victim of fasisim (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="758">and at the end of the day they finally believed me and it didn't take that much longer then I got my visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Through the generosity of President Truman who had allocated visas for this place person. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">From -- it was a complete supply and several weeks later there in May of 1945 -- '46 excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bromine</span> (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="762">to the port of Bromine on my way to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="763">So I first notified my friends that I was coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bromine</span> and all three of them, Margaret, Gerta and Lilly came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bromine</span> We were housed there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">British camps</span> they had set up and we were housed there four weeks before we left on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And my girlfriends spent the whole week with me there which was absolutely wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">We had a great time together. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And they saw me off. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">On the 14th of May 1946 we were put aboard a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">liberty ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="768">It was, you know, a former <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American troop transport</span> , the marine perch. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And we were put aboard the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> on our trip to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Now, it was quite primitive of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Being an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army ship</span> we had triple -- triple <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , but I really spend no time in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">I spent the whole time up on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> because down below you would only get sea sick because everybody there got sea sick, so I stayed on top and our whole group had a wonderful time. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">We were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> for 10 days and we were supplied there by the sailors with fresh food which to us was a real novelty and I was never sea sick, so I could enjoy all the good foods that they offered me and had really a great time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="774">QUESTION:  Did you know -- did you have any friends on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> before you --
ANSWER:  No, none of my friends -- well, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">They were mostly not from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="776">There were different people who had just come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , but no, I don't recall that I met anybody from my camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">QUESTION:  Weren't you a little nervous about taking this large trip all by yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">ANSWER:  Oh, certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Oh, certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And I had nobody in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">It was a big undertaking -- taking, but I certainly wasn't going to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="782">That I couldn't do. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I couldn't stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">So we all wanted to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">My friends wanted to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">So when we spotted the Statue of Liberty as we were close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> that was the biggest thrill of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">So we landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and the Joint Distribution committee was there to greet us and they put us up in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and they took care of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And what they had in mind was they were going to send, there were quite a few young girls among us and they had in mind to send us young girls out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> because they figured we wouldn't be able to get jobs in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and even, you could even get <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> or even a <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span> was difficult to come by. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">It was shortly after the war when all the soldiers had come back, so they tried to place the young girls with Jewish families all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="790">You know, to be baby sitters, household help to Jewish families and for some reason I was absolutely determined to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">I don't -- I don't really know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">I had nobody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">The only thing I had was my -- my Jewish soldiers from my <span class="BUILDING">army base</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> had given me addresses of their families in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> whom I contacted and this somehow made me feel I wanted to stay here and even though the Jewish committee told me I probably wouldn't be able to find a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and I wouldn't find accommodations in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> I managed through these contacts to find myself a furnished room. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">I also found a job as a seamstress and so then I was on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">You know, I -- I moved into the <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span> and I started a life on my own being a steam stress. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Now, in the meantime, my health, of course, had been permanently impaired through all the years of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and wandering around in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and I had this serious intestinal problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Always pain and diareah and so, which was later on diagnosed as . </span><span class="sentence" id="798">So that made it very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">I mean, I went to work as a seamstress. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">I went to work everyday. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">I didn't even miss work even when I was running a fever, I went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And this went on -- meanwhile, my girlfriends Margaret and Gerta were still at their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the west. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">My girlfriend Lilly had found two of her brothers, two older brothers were alive and she found them back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Colon</span> and they had gone to an Uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and they were living in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Now, um -- I'm stuck. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">I had- yeah, so a year after I had gotten to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , in fact, in June of 1947 I met my future husband at the <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="806">I forgot to mention, my friends Margaret and Gerta came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> a year after me. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">They had an Uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> and they settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="808">So meanwhile, I met my husband into the end of June of 1947 and three months later we got married because he had had similar experiences that I had except that he had come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> just before the war, but he us never able to get his parents out and his parents and younger sister were also killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="809">So for our wedding in October, my girlfriends Margaret and Gerta came to celebrate our wedding even though they were here only such a short time and had just started jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">But they managed to come here and it was really wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">So, I mean, we were able to find, my husband and I got a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="812">You know, <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> were very hard to come by and started a new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">I continued on sewing. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">You know, working as a seamstress. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">He had come back from -- from the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">He was in the American army and he was working in the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> , so we got settled in for a new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And the only draw back was that I was sick so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Then in 1949 our son was born and after that my really got bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Even worse than before and while he was quite young yet I was in and out of <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> and that made it, of course, quite difficult for my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">He had to go to work and had to take care of the child after work. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">He got some from cousins and from friends who helped out, but in general, it was quite difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">But all in all, we had a good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And so, you know, we can't complain. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">We're very happy that we are here in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and were able to start all over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And in the mean time then just about three years ago to ad to my other aliments I got a very sever case of shingles in my head and my eye and because of my impaired immune system through all the years of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> I could never get over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">I had -- I suffered a severely damaged nerve that leaves me in constant pain and, but you have to put up with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">You know, life goes on. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">We have a very close relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">We have a 16 year old granddaughter and we have a very close relationship with our family and so life is good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">QUESTION:  I'm going to ask you a few more questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="831">ANSWER:  Can you turn on the air conditioner or something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="832">QUESTION:  Do you want to take a break for a couple minutes? </span><span class="sentence" id="833">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">We'll have a couple of photographs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="836">QUESTION:  Did you think that you would survive all of this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="837">ANSWER:  Well, I tell you, we were hoping. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">We didn't think with a clear mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">We were hoping we would survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">In fact, when we were in these wooden <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> doing our last work detail in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , at night, you know, we -- there was no light in the <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> or anything, we would lay down and we would reminisce and make believe we were in our cozy <span class="INT_SPACE">living rooms</span> at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and the mother of Margaret and Gerta would us the story of her news and how she had spent time at the <span class="BUILDING">English finishing school</span> , so we kept ourselves alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">In fact, when we were digging the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> we were standing on top of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> where we dug the <span class="DLF">trench</span> we would sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">So we would always try to look on the bright side and hope we would survive it. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Never really believing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="844">QUESTION:  What do you think gave you the strength? </span><span class="sentence" id="845">I mean, you were a young girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">You were all alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="847">ANSWER:  Yeah, well --
QUESTION:  What do you think got you through this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="848">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">I just had the will to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">It's as simple as that. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">So after my husband and I were married already as I said, my girlfriends Margaret and Gerta lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in <span class="REGION">west Germany</span> until they came to the <span class="COUNTRY">states</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="852">Our girlfriend Lilly immigrated from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="853">That wasn't quite <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> and she met a young man that became a doctor and who 1s a professor in medical research and they still live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And we four girls have kept in contact steadily over all these more than 50 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">We telephone each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">We get together once in awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">Even when Lilly from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> has been here on any -- any number of times and then we try to all four get together and reminisce about the old times and think how good we have it now in contrast. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">So the friendship has gone on between our families now for all these years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="859">QUESTION:  You guys have quite a bond.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="860">ANSWER:  Yes, quite a bond. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">We are very close.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="862">QUESTION:  Were -- were there other people who, I guess, didn't survive by helping each other and who were- I mean, -- well, I guess what I'm asking is was there a different sense of morality at that time being that people were struggling so hard to survive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="863">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">I mean, you fought for every piece of bread, for every, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And it made it very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">You know, people did fight with each other and which we never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">You know, we always -- she had every bit that we had and that saved us because I'm sure none of us would be alive today if we had not had this close bond and -- and did everything together and shared everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">All our experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">All our food. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="872">QUESTION:  How important was religion to you through out all of this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="873">ANSWER:  Well, I still believed in God even though it was very difficult under the circumstances to believe that there was a god. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">That he let us go through all these hard times, but I guess men -- I guess 1t was meant to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">So, I mean, I looked at it that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="876">QUESTION:  Did you pray?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="877">ANSWER:  Yes, I prayed that we would some day be freed. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">We would some day be able to go back to a normal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="879">QUESTION:  You never resented the ;
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="882">QUESTION:  It's still important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="883">ANSWER:  It's still very important and it's very important to my granddaughter especially. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">She is very aware of the Jewish synagogue. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">You know, they don't keep a <span class="BUILDING">kosher house</span> , but she goes to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> regularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">And is involved with Jewish youth groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Go away together on weekends some times with Jewish youth groups and she says she will only marry a Jewish fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">She wants to go to a <span class="BUILDING">college</span> where there are a lot of Jewish fellows.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="889">QUESTION:  Did you think that <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was any different for you being a young women and getting through all of this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">ANSWER:  Oh, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">You know, an older person certainly wouldn't have had the strength to survive all these hardships and all these illnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="892">QUESTION:  But what about being a women versus a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">Did you survive differently? </span><span class="sentence" id="894">In terms of relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">In terms of --
ANSWER:  I don't -- I wouldn't -- couldn't really tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">I'm really not aware of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="897">QUESTION:  Was it difficult to begin again? </span><span class="sentence" id="898">Either --
ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">It was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">We had nothing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">We came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with the dresses that I had made for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">That was at that time our only clothing, so we later on got some others. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And we started from scratch. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">From nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">Got ourselves jobs and then we were all fortunate to find husbands. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Well, we were finished anyhow, huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="908">QUESTION:  What --
ANSWER:  You too, huh? </span><span class="sentence" id="909">Not only happens to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="910">QUESTION:  Um, when you think back on this period of time and I'm sure the image is with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="911">ANSWER:  Well, the image, of course, that sticks most in my mind is when my parents were taken away on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="912">Never to be seen again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">QUESTION:  Other than all these very, how do you say it, health problems you went through, do you feel that phsycologically the experiences you went through at that time impacted you in the way you live your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">ANSWER:  No, actually, that when we -- when I first came over here and then we first got married, actually my husband and I, we were so full of hate for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and all it stood for that we refused to speak German which now, I sort of regret because my son could have grown up with two languages, but we just didn't want to be reminded. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And actually, I mean, I -- I learned my English actually while I was working at the <span class="BUILDING">American army base</span> from all the soldiers who came form all -- all parts of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="916">So we really don't dwell on the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">I must say though that most of our friends are German or Austrian born. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">We have American born friends too, but most of them are European born. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">None of them had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> really. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">I'm the only one of that group, but -- so we never really dwell on the past much except for occasions like this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="921">QUESTION:  Have you -- did you befriend mostly Germans and Austrians because coming over here you felt more in common with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="922">ANSWER:  Yes, first of all, we lived in the, what is called here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , the third , Because it's only really occupied by European Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">So we live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">In fact, there are many Jews living in that <span class="REGION">area</span> now who mostly speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">There is a <span class="DLF">park</span> there that's called and that's up in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And if you go to that <span class="DLF">park</span> you hear more German than English. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">So --
QUESTION:  You remember this -- do you remember different impressions when you arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="928">ANSWER:  No, my first impressions were really the -- well, the statue of liberty of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And seeing the tall <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> very impressive even though, I mean, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> it's not exactly a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , but it doesn't have sky scrappers like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="930">I was very much impressed by that and then I must say we were well taken care of at first. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">You know, we were put up at a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> for awhile, you know, to get out of my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And we were made to feel at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="933">The relief of were really good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="934">QUESTION:  Nothing that startled you about the lifestyle though?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="935">ANSWER:  Well, in those days the lifestyle was better than it is now a days. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">So, no, nothing really startled me too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">There was one point furnished <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> here before I met my husband that a Jewish family had taken me into and I was taking care of their boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">I was babysitting for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">Then again, I found another, you know, furnished room later on and -- and then, you know, I got married very soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="940">QUESTION:  Is there anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">I don't think there's too much time left on this tape, but is there anything else you'd like to add?</span></p>
