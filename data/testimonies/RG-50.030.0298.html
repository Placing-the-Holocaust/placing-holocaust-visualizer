<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  When I was a child, I -- for me <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> was everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">It was everything because we could find there everything what belongs to the Jewish life, from our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> to our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in Hebrew or Yiddish, till many universal things like <span class="BUILDING">cinemas</span> and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So we felt ourself as a part of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Part of, I would say, <span class="REGION">Western Europe</span> , or Europe, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">It was an orientation. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">In our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> the German language was one of the languages spoken, because my father used to work with German companies, and after Hitler came he changed a little and went to other <span class="BUILDING">companies</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So, he now house the coming and going people from abroad and what's most important is we have very good connection with <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Actually my generation, or part of my generation we were dreaming about <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> like we were there, and the geography of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , I knew better than the geography of our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">The same also with the languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">The Lithuanian language we only had to do it for examinations and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">But the daily language was Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Hebrew at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Hebrew in the youth movement, and Hebrew when I make my first date with a girl in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , we also did Hebrew, and my parents understand Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">See, I wasn't one. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">It was a culture, a part of the culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">The -- not everybody was the same kind, but let's say 50 percent of my generation was the same in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">This time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , I remember there were many, many <span class="BUILDING">shuls</span> (ph), or <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> , about 40 I remember from there, and I think it was more or less right, a real number, and I attend a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew primary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Afterwards what we called <span class="BUILDING">gymanasium</span> , it means <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I was in Hebrew, and my youth movement was called Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So, we were oriented for to go after we attend our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and there or to be on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , or to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Techni</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Technion</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> -- that was my other .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  Why were you so intrigued or driven towards <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  I cannot understand it now, but it was so natural the same as a I was born Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So it was a part of all I been, my family, my bigger family. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">It was our culture, our orientation, so we took it for granted that so should be. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Even one of my uncles went to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , but he was an exception. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">His name was Borris Levin, and only this week I met his daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">She come now from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> to settle here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Scranton</span> , <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  What -- I'd like to hear a little bit more about the Youth Movement that you were involved in, the group you just mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">What was the basis of that? </span><span class="sentence" id="52">What were you taught? </span><span class="sentence" id="53">What kind of activities did you participate in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  You know, most of the youth movements are alike more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">They are making sport games and making journeys and making <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camps</span> and other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , singing a lot, a lot, a lot, and telling stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Very nice stories mostly about <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutzim</span> and making it very idealistic and really for me <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eretz Yisrael</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , was like in the pictures, that palm <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> with <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> and chalutzim (ph), pioneers, are dancing around, sometimes also working. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So that also was the contents of our activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">We were- they told us what is the daily life, not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutzim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And that was made by emissaries, shlichim (ph) in Hebrew, which come very often to us, so we knew also the later songs from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and we very up to date what's going there, what happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Sometimes more than what happened in our own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Did they teach you how to use weapons, how to fight if you needed to, any of those sorts of things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair was one of the few organizations that were socialist minded. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So, the orientation of weapon was only for defense. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So, they talked with us about the shomrim (ph), it means the guardsmen in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> that at night they are riding on the horses and that was a . [</span><span class="sentence" id="66">remember even the names of these guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So, but, it was only a need, but not too much, in the opposite let's say of the Beitar Movement, they were really military oriented. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And I remember in our class, in the Hebrew class, let's say half of the class was -- belonged to Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, the other to Beitar, so we are quarrelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">One of the discussions was how do you mean to settle in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , only by buying an acre after an acre ground and to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Each <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> must be taken only by force that the history is in all the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> 1n all the world, all the times. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So, we were quarrelling and so on and some times we are also beating each others. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So it was not only in our class, it was like in all <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">The community is divided in many orientations, in many ideologies, but our whole community from the Communists till the most, most Orthodox people like my late grandfather, his name was David Levin. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">He was a patriarchic Jew, a very strong man, like in these times. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Not like my father, my father was already another generation, more liberal. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So, this whole community was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We cannot remember intermarriage, and if 1t happens, so everybody knew who is who and it was something. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I remember that also that in our <span class="INT_SPACE">classroom</span> , one girl brought one day -- we were without hats, we were -- it was more traditional but not Orthodox, anyway, when one of my girlfriends from the class, a classmate, she brought a sandwich with butter and meat, so everybody shouts, "Look what's happened, she's eating so and so." </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So, the public mind of the class was against maybe the other day she didn't know because she didn't felt herself convenient. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I even remember her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">It was Tanya Tzvi. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Tanya Tzvi, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And she's still living. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">She's in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  So, it was a very religious community?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  Not very, but it was very Yiddish, Jewish minded. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">For instance, Shabbat (ph), I think 95 percent of the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Orthodox, or not Orthodox, or traditional or anti-traditional, only the last years we are accepts, yes accepts. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And only some <span class="BUILDING">cafe houses</span> or other <span class="NPIP">places</span> but usually they are closed and it was not an easy problem because for the government we had also had to be closed Sundays. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So, it was lose of two days of earning. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Anyway, so it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  So you're talking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobotka</span> , the whole <span class="REGION">area</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  Which <span class="REGION">area</span> did you grow up in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  I grew up in the -- now we can call it the down town of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , but not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobotka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobotka</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">You have to cross a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> by the name of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vilitya</span> (ph), or now it's called <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Nairis</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="99">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobotka</span> were concentrated for many, many years a more poor population. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">More poor, some of them very Orthodox but some -- on the other hand there were many people who were Communist oriented. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And that -- anyway I can think that in my <span class="INT_SPACE">classroom</span> only one boy was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobotka</span> and it's also because his mother was a dentist there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  Let me ask you something because you just mentioned Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">There were also youth groups that were Communist oriented right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  I'm just sort of wondering how one chose to belong to Beitar versus the Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">What were some of the differences? </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Did -- was there any interaction between these groups?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  Interactions were what I mentioned before, it's fighting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  How did you decide to join the group you chose?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Yes, I remember that it was a very deep sympathy for this because they were also scouts and when I was a child I like much to be a scout. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And officially Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair for the government we are calling Jewish Scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Maybe if I would be in another society and my father was be very right, political right orientation, maybe, I was sent or not sent be encouraged to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beitar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I remember another thing that I have quarrels with my parents because I went Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">For them it was too left. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Afterwards when I grew up, when I was a teenager, so it was incidents, sometimes instead to go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> I went to the activities there. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">But it was not only my problem, it was a problem for a whole generation and it happens in all the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> till now. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  What about the Communist groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Did you know people who joined those?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  Yes, they were for us very mysterious because the Communist party and the other people were in underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">This party wasn't allowed in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , because <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> was very much right oriented and what I remember that the -- May, first May we watched many times that police forces are ready for demonstrations and we saw that sometimes red flags at were hanged that night and morning the police made effort to put them down. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Of course as young people we were sympathizing with the Communists, but it was for us very not -- unclear who is a Communist, why and what. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">We knew its have to do something with <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , <span class="REGION">Soviet Russia</span> of course, but not too much more. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I would not say it was a puzzle for us, but something mystery.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  I think you said that you sort of sympathized when their demonstrations were put down. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Why would you sympathize with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Oh, that's like a child what -- who don't police, the cops.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  Now in 1940, I think, the Russians took over Kovno, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  How did that change your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Oh, it was a big change, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I remember it was at Shabbat, Saturday, the 15th of June. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">We were in this day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair and my counselor was afterwards a very known woman, Chaika Grossman (ph) from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">She told us this days -- this day but not only this day as she left oriented -- orientated -- girl or young woman escaped from the Russian in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> , and came as refugee to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> because she was a Zionist and she could not live under the Soviets, even, even Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair was very, very much orient -- Soviet oriented, so it was how to tell you, half, half, mixed feelings about <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And now this Shabbat we heard -- the Saturday- we heard noise, afterwards I understood that it was the movings of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and we left everything and we moved very quickly to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , by foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">It was about eight miles or so to go back by foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And his <span class="NPIP">place</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Claiboneshkis</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="139">It's the opposite side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobotka</span> but on the <span class="REGION">Kovno side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and I remember that going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we saw many Lithuanians with angry faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Some of them took their guns because they belonged to a semi-military organization called Shaulei (ph), Shootings Man. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So, they wear uniforms some of them, and some took the guns and they were running here and there like something happened and they didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Bur they were very angry and didn't so of course smile to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Of course, the opposite. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So I understood that something is going to be wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">That is a feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">To me as a Jewish boy, boy, I was then 15 years old, yeah, 15 and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So, we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> was a very like a festival. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">People are staying in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and making a for the Red Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Jewish, non Jewish, all mixed, the crowd. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And I went straight <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because to see what happened, and that was beginning of the Soviet era in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> that lasted one year and seven days. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">For me personally, it was a very bad -- no it was not a bad time, it was also interesting time. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">First of all, I was shocked by the closing of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154"><span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> was abolished and we have to in the same, yes in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> we have to learn Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I couldn't understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Who is forcing me, why? </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I knew all because they were against zionism and Hebrew 1s like a Zionist language. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We were very against, and the other thing was Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair was abolished. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And on the other hand, it was very interesting time, every second day there was a parade, a meeting, a demonstration with songs, very famous songs, that we -- some of them we heard even before, like "Katusha" (ph). (</span><span class="sentence" id="160">humming). </span><span class="sentence" id="161">It's -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> it's popular till now, but no more in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And other songs -- marches --

<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  What other -- what other changes in terms of people's lifestyles were made when the Soviets took over -- were business closed? </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I mean, what -- was it more difficult to be a Jew openly, or --
ANSWER:  No, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">It's the contrary, now we become really equal citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I could see Jewish policemen. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I was very proud in this, first time, but the same time for instance my father should to work at Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">My father, how my father, but my grandfather was very Orthodox man so they took away him from his <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , put in a comissar and he have to sit <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and to count his days, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I'm not sure that he gets a small pension. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I don't know, maybe we helped him. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Till this day he was a well-to-do man. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">What you call your middle-middle, but now he become unemployed even though he was about 70-75 years, but still he was every day going to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">The <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was more than a place for earning. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">It was occupation, there everybody came to him and so, and so it was like a club. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And that happened to many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">So nobody, nobody starve from hunger, nobody, but it happened after things that people were rich had to go out and leave their nice <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">suites</span> and sometimes also their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Poor people for them it was a better change. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And for me as a socialist, or socialist-oriented, I could understand it and evaluate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Even for my family it was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Another of my uncles was -- he visit twice <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and hesitate if to settle or not, now they took all his fabric, what's is -- <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">It was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> of leather, a big one. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">They were working in it I guess about 35 or 40 workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And one of them became the commissar, he was thrown out, and I understand he was very sorry he didn't go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> with his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">His name was Moses Levin. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I have here, I am keeping many papers and forms of his <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> till now. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I got them last year. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So, this is an example of a family that something changes the life. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">My mother has also to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Till then she was a housekeeper like all the balabustes (ph) in our class, also a middle-middle, upper -- no it was middle-middle, enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Here she has to work everyday so there were some days that all the family didn't meet because one is working afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">One is working from morning until noon. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And Shabbos -- Saturday we can not also meet like we used. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So it was something new for me but I wasn't too happy about this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">QUESTION:  Let me ask you one question about the different groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Now before the Soviets took over, you said the Communist youth groups were really underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Did they become more important under that year of Soviet rule than some of the Zionist movements?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">ANSWER:  Of course, they become now the rulers, the mayflowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">For them -- especially these people who were sitting for months or years. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">One of them was 20 years sitting in the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">They become the commissars. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I remember the commissar was 1n my grandfather's <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">He was still without hair, you know, because in the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> they have to cut their hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So he was still very new released from the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and the government gave them new clothes, mostly leather coats. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">The commissars, that's the tradition of <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Russia</span> from the October revolution and so on and anyway that was the gona (ph), the gona it means it closes. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Also, my father didn't wear more his hat and wear a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">caskette</span> (ph), we call it, like a Stalin hat on his head. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">That what modern, to be a politaria (ph) man and a socialist and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And I remember also me, 1n -- when I was in the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , I have a special uniform, so the uniforms they called it "Habits of the Bourgeoi." </span><span class="sentence" id="212">No more everybody is wearing what he wants and what you are more closer to the model of study and all the other big shots, such a shirt not too much with a tie. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So the people understood that that is more wanted now. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So, it was a big change but there were many concerts and the cultural life was very, very intensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">The first time to go to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> was then for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">ANSWER:  Because to go into the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> before, it was a problem to get a ticket in the big <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> and here in the <span class="BUILDING">Yiddish theater</span> I didn't want to go because it was kiche (ph) and I was not too much involved in the Yiddish culture, except talking Yiddish and reading Jewish newspaper, daily newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> there were about four newspapers, daily newspapers, in such a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">QUESTION:  Jewish daily newspapers -- all four Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  Yiddish, Yiddish not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">There was only one weekly in Lithuanian, and that also was made more for political terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">So, coming back to your question, so please remind me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">QUESTION:  We were talking the -- about how the Communist groups became much more important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  It was very natural that they become. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">It was their time now. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">People coming from the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> to the public. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Well, as a members of the Communist party and the people who belong in other ways to this party or to this movement or to this ideology who were before or in <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> or in non-legal situation, they become now big shots, and it was very- naturally it was very -- everybody could understand it and what happened that some people were far from them, now went to see, maybe one of his family is also between them. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Maybe he will be now helped by them, privileged by them, to get a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">It wasn't so easy to get a job, because everybody have to fulfill questionnaires. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Who you are, who was your father0, what was your income and so on and to which organizations you did belong and etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So some people even they were before bourgeoi, what belonged to the so- called bourgeoi, or it was another name. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Enemy of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Now, if they have a good one of the family who was a Communist and he was not afraid to help them, not afraid, some denied, "Okay you are my cousin, but I know who you are, so please leave me alone." </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Some of them helped also and what another thing that we have seen many people that were very rich before and not only they were leaved on their <span class="NPIP">places</span> but they became- they make even a progress, they are promoted. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So, we were told that even before they paid contributions to the Communists funds. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Or maybe they have them more, maybe they were spies, [don't know what they were such -- we called them -- how did we call them? </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Salon (ph) Communists.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">QUESTION:  One more question and then I want to move onto the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Yousaid -- your organization became illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Did you continue -- did Beitar and some of the other organizations continue but on an underground basis now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Some of the organizations began to -- no, officially they abolished themselves in order to avoid troubles. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They declared -- some of the Zionist groups or even religious groups who were, who were abolished, I think all of them declared officially that they stopped their work, their activity in order to avoid troubles. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">But bit by bit some of the members who were accustomed to meet every day or every few days together continue to do it, and then somebody gave them an orientation that if you want you can do it, but nobody is responsible for you, do it yourself or you won't. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And so they established small <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> like before the Communists did it, in the near past. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So, now the Zionists did it and my organization, my youth movement, Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, I remember that some of them, some of them were meeting each day -- no, not each day, twice a week maybe, to read Hebrew books. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">That was activity. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Because it's not forbidden, but not fashionable -- it an understatement -- so they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">When I want to join them, they said, "We are too much, no, go look another <span class="NPIP">place</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="250">After that they told me that they were afraid of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I don't know why, maybe because I have some friends who were in the Youth Communist's Party -- movement, youth movement called Consomole (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So that they told me afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Anyway, so Idid -- what I did myself in order to express my feelings, afternoon or at night I come to the, to a new -- through this old <span class="BUILDING">building</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and stole Hebrew books and brought them <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I was very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">For me it was like I did what I have to do, what I like to do and nobody -- maybe I can be punished for this but only for stealing but not for reading the Hebrew books, because I also, my old Hebrew books that I got for bar mitzvah and other things I -- they were kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">We didn't throw them. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I remember also that even the religious was very unpopular and some of us were forced to come to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> Yom Kippur and Pesach, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">We tried to keep at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> how we could -- and me I was not so happy with that religion in this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I understand it because that is something of all continuity so I did it also, no too much, but I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">So I remember Shabbat when our family were together, so sometimes <span class="NPIP">place</span> my father also make Kiddush (ph) and I didn't refuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">What happened at this time -- yes -- I didn't stop to write letters to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">QUESTION:  You could have gotten in trouble, yes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">ANSWER:  Yes or not, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">It could be. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">The question how they would comment it, the authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Another thing, I also heard the of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It was very hard, but it was a technical problem so I remember I wrote to one of my friends of the class, my classmates, his names was Amos Rabinovitz (ph), Amos Rabinovitz, that why you will not tell your authority to make better that we can hear it even in Lithuanian Kovno.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  You can probably guess one of the reasons I'm asking you about these youth groups and whether you had to go underground and all of that is because later on you were involved in resistance activities, and I'm wondering if any of the tricks you learned, any of the relationships you formed as a boy were important later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Were a way that you kind of developed that helped you and got you interested in resistance activities later?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">ANSWER:  Yes, partly, I didn't belong to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> usually which numbered three or four members. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I told you why and there was no trouble on this, but I knew and also we knew, all the generations, about underground because we were brought up what I told you of Jewish modern history that -- and not only Jewish history but about the socialists or revolutionaries in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> against the Czar. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So, we knew what to do and we saw many films about this, so it was not very new for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">But there were some people who begin at this time to publish a underground newspaper in Hebrew, but that I learned not at this time but in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  Okay, let's -- I want to move ahead a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Do you remember what was happening the day that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> was occupied by the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> was occupied by the Germans not the first day of war, but the third day. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">It was Tuesday. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">You know what, I felt a little better because the bombing stopped and we have no special <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> so we were hiding ourselves in -- on the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> between the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> , because it was in the middle of a very heavy <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , it was the safest <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And you have to run, and here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So, first of all was its relaxation, a certain relaxation. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">We can go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , maybe and we can eat a time more or less that was the first reaction. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">We knew that we have not to expect good times. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">That we knew very good from the refugees who came to us and from the newspapers I had also knew not exactly but a lot what they did when they came in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> a year ago and so on and so on but everybody 1s thinking that to me it will not come. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And I remember that the day before somebody informed us from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> it was my also from my <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> his name is Avraham Yashpan (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="285">He is now living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rio de Janeiro</span> and told me, "Look, I'm going to escape to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">They will slaughter us." </span><span class="sentence" id="287">They, it means not only Germans, but everybody except the Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">We felt that the Lithuanians don't like us, or hate us, better. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">We felt it, but we didn't know how much. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So, I told him I cannot leave my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Or in other words, so I heard his mother voice through the telephone, "You see Belle is a better son than you. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">He's not going to leave his family." </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Yes, and this woman by the name of Rachael, or Rochel, Rachel Yashpan, she was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> , and I met her after the war near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rio de Janeiro</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">She could not come to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> for certain reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So we were expecting somebody is going to happen, and it happened very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I remember from this only two or three things. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">One, it come to us, I would call them a gang of five or six people, people from the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">People with guns or with half-guns or something and they took us to the <span class="DLF">back yard</span> -- not the <span class="DLF">back yard</span> but to the -- you know, all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were a big place around, so they took us and when we come down, we were living the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> , we show all the Jewish families in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">It means that 90- 99 percent except the Gentile are staying in a <span class="DLF">line</span> and the people come to take us are staying against us with guns and we was very frightened, except when he put, one of them, a young guy put his gun against me. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">So I remember my mother told me, "If you turn now he will not harm you. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">He knows that you are a good boy." </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And they told us they had seen the Jewish people are working against the Germans and against the Lithuanian partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">They called themselves partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">So, I don't know what happened but we were released to our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">When we come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we have seen that in my daddy's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , he has his own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> for writing, what do you call it shaipdish (ph), so he was missing his golden box for cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So, maybe this was their excuse to come here or to release us, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I remember another thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I remember the same day we heard in the radio the first order in Lithuanian language, "Nobody is to go out and nobody is to take arms," and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">What each army is doing when it's coming into an <span class="REGION">occupied area</span> , but one, I think it was the last paragraph there, was for each German soldier will be shot, it will be shot 100 Jewish people signed by Colonel Bobyalous (ph), the commandant of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">He was appointed right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And now, let me tell you the same, a year ago when I visited <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> as a member of a delegation from the <span class="BUILDING">Knesset</span> I met in the <span class="BUILDING">parliament</span> the son of Mr. Bobyalous, head of the committee of defense and foreign affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And he should be my host to take me so I avoided twice to shake hands with him, and I didn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  That's ironic. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  We were talking about how -- what was going on when the Nazis occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">occupied Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">As I understand it, there was a tremendous amount of chaos, certainly in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">People were being beaten, killed, taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I don't know if this was something that you saw or experienced?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  Something I saw through the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and I avoided such things to see, naturally, and I saw through the <span class="DLF">window</span> , for instance, that a young man is going on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and somebody 1s arresting him or holding him. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">This young man took from his pocket a certain paper and showed it to the others -- no I think they told him to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">He refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">That I understood from his movements, and they showed a certain paper maybe it was -- he get it from the Germans, or he worked for somebody already, so they become very angry and took him by the two <span class="NPIP">sides</span> and arrested him. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And what makes me very bad feelings is that all the crowds on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , they are trying to make a lynch of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">So, then I felt it's not only the Germans, but everybody enemy to each Jew, even to people who were not Communists, who were not part of the Soviet government. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">It's enough to be a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So, for instance, my grandfather, I came to visit him because he was living in the more quieter <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> than mine, so my parents decided we are living maybe too much in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , so it's more dangerous so let's go to the grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">The Grandfather was living on a small <span class="DLF">street</span> called Nomonu (ph) Street, <span class="BUILDING">Nomonu 14</span> , I think, and everything was very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">It was a <span class="DLF">garden</span> on the corner, very idealistic, very quiet, and some day came a Lithuanian, civilian Lithuanian with a rifle and come to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">So, he told that he is running after people to work, taking them to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">That was a daily habit. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Jewish people were taken to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">It was part of a to work or to making them work -- it was part of making them that everybody can see them in bad situation, the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">That, for instance, an old man has to go with two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">He's in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> and everybody is going and beating him and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">So, it was much more than only physical work. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">So, once such man with a rifle come to take my old, old grandfather to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">My grandfather refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">So, he even didn't talk to him Lithuanian. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">My grandfather asked me to tell him that he's too old. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">So, he told me that he will take him by force. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So, the grandfather told me to tell him that nothing will help, and they can't take him. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">So, nothing will -- we will not go. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And my grandfather has experience from World War I that I knew also with all the gangs in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> when they were deported to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> by the Czars in the -- during the revolution that each gang who come -- occupies a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> took people and arrested them sometimes he cruel to them, so, he had very, very good experience of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I would not say good, but rich, let's say. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">So, he refused, and what happened, in a certain moment I saw two German soldiers are coming with a Lithuanian guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Afterwards I was told that a neighbor from the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> saw that the old and very distinguished Mr. Dovid Levin 1s taken by such a hooligan, to work, he was very shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So far, that her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where two German soldiers were put to live there -- 1t happened in all <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">It was a custom that in each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had to take some soldiers and they were living there. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">She said, "Look they are going to take this old man to work." </span><span class="sentence" id="350">So, they come and saved him. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">That was very -- I was very impressed by this.

<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  I can tell you only what I have seen, in these times I have seen Jewish policemen, and I was told -- so I remember that when we come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> it should be one or two days before the 15th of August 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">We found already Jewish police there. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Some of them were occupied by helping to build the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and some of them were also staying and working some <span class="NPIP">places</span> , the <span class="DLF">lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">The <span class="DLF">lines</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">There were special <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> for Jewish people, already in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , so maybe they are moved to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Anyway, there were certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> to deliver food, very small <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , very small at the beginning of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="545">So, you can feel, I could feel that somebody is -- we knew that it is a committee so that we can feel that someone is taking care, or delivering food. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Somebody has to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And also, the policemen are, they must have more higher degrees of commanders and so on, so we knew that it is a certain organization which is responsible for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and this 100 percent Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">But we didn't know how much they can decide, how long, how far. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">That we couldn't do. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I remember that one day it was Yom Kippur when many people were praying so we saw that from, he is coming a Jewish man, his name is Luria (ph), Luria, and he's telling, "Look we know you are going to pray. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">It's very important for you, maybe also for us, but what's more important is you have stopped to do it and everybody who is 1n a certain age," he tell them, "You have to come and to work very, very urgent, because Germans demand I don't know how many thousands or so many Jewish workers for their war effort." </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Maybr he told us the aerodromes (ph), the <span class="BUILDING">airports</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="553">And you have to do it, I'm sorry that I have to interrupt you." </span><span class="sentence" id="554">So, he went from one to another, from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another and people really stopped pray except the old people or what the kids and went to the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I don't know if the Germans did it special for Yom Kippur or maybe for them it wasn't -- they did it from their point of view, but that's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">So we couldn't understand that this man, everybody shout, "That's Luria," he was, before the war he was a judge. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">A judge it -- we had not many Jewish judges in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , so maybe it was one or two, so he was very authoritatic, he were talking in language of orders, explained very short, that 1s so, we understood that it's from the Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">We called it a committee, the word Elderstrat (ph), we didn't knew yet, but bit by bit we knew it and we have to -- we came to see also the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">It was in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">It was a brown <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , two floors, but we didn't call not this Elderstrat, and not Judenrat, but the Commitet (ph), in Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Comitet, it means committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Even till the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">On the other hand, on their announcements, the papers, it was signed Elderstrat or Chairman of the Elderstrat, so and so, or Secretary of the Elderstrat, so bit by bit we understand also this term, and I remember that in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the staff, 1t was two <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> , in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was a certain -- on a <span class="DLF">door</span> was hanging a certain announcement, Va'ad (ph) in Hebrew, Va'ad Ziknei Ha'Eidah (ph), it's old name for the Eldest of Zion. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">So the eldest of the community it's a paraphrase, so in Yiddish Elderstart and also in German and maybe also in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuanian</span> , I saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">So, bit by bit we knew that this was the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">QUESTION:  Did you know any of these people who formed the Consul of Elders or Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">ANSWER:  Yes, we knew it bit by bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Nobody come and told us, "You know, we have a committee from this day and so on and so on," but we knew, of course we knew Dr. Elkous, the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">We knew Yaakov Goldberg, we knew Rabbi Shmulker (ph) and maybe others knew more. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I was only a youngster at this time, so for me it was enough also three or four names, but I knew very much that they are having the rule inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">They are delivering <span class="NPIP">places</span> to work, or jobs, better <span class="NPIP">places</span> , worse <span class="NPIP">places</span> and in order to get a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you must have what you could -- what you called protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Protectzia (ph), of protectzieh (ph), in Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">It means to be protected or known by the people who are delivering the works in order to get a better one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">QUESTION:  How did you get protection?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">ANSWER:  It's protection not in the word of a mafia, but if I know that one of the people is working in the <span class="BUILDING">office of work</span> , Arbeitzampt (ph), or he was my teacher before or maybe a neighbor or maybe a friend or relative somehow, so go to him and ask him, "Here I am, and it's very hard for me to work in this lousy <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Please give me another one." </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And so, it happened that some people were working very hard, some people less, and what's important that the people who were working hard even could not, or have the possibilities to buy something, or change food for clothes, or clothes for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">So, if bad is bad at all, if it's good, it's better at all -- more or less everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">QUESTION:  Now, some of the names you mentioned like Dr. Elkous, Mr. Goldberg, did you -- what was your feeling about these people? </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Did you feel they were taking good care of you? </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Did you feel that because they were having to answer to the Nazis that maybe they weren't so good? </span><span class="sentence" id="582">What was your attitude about this committee and about the Jewish police also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">ANSWER:  When we are talking in the beginning of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we feel that we are together in one bad <span class="NPIP">position</span> , and we didn't know what we knew afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">So, maybe who didn't get a good job were more opposed, and the others was more pro, but we didn't know that we can expect critical, or vital decisions from the Committee, or the Elderstrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">They can only execute orders, this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">QUESTION:  Do you remember what you -- did you have an opinion of them at the time? </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Did you think they were helping you? </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Did you trust them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">ANSWER:  More than the opposite.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">QUESTION:  Did you know any of them personally, other than just knowing their name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">ANSWER:  No, I didn't know any of them, nobody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">QUESTION:  Now, you were living in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and very early in the life of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was liquidated, correct? </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Where were you and can you tell me what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">ANSWER:  Yes, it was called also aktzion, not the first one. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">So, we were told to move in a certain direction and it was to where the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Great Ghetto</span> , and at a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> they made a selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I don't remember where, probably at the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I don't -- that I don't remember, because I was in such situations I -- when I cannot help myself I become very introverted, introverted, till now. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">But when I decide to do something this other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">So I cannot remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I remember only one thing, that we moved everybody, all four families, four of my family, we crossed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> together with my friend Bora Grodnik (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="601">He was very upset because he left -- he lost his father. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">His father was with a beard, elderly man, maybe also younger than me today, he lost him and he understood what is the meaning of losing. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So he was very upset, but kept himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And when we crossed on the other side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we come in in the first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the <span class="DLF">street</span> on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and come into a Jewish family to rest or something, or to -- I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">They leave, they left -- they allowed us to come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Maybe somebody -- they gave us maybe water or tea, I don't remember, something. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I remember even the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">The name was Sefer (ph), Sefer. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">The head of the family was a policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">But it was done like solidarity of Jewish people. "</span><span class="sentence" id="611">Something happened, come in, live, relax," and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">After this, I don't remember how we found another <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">That I don't know, but I know that after we were put in another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , Linkura (ph) or Linkuvos (h), yeah, number 56 together with other families in a wooden <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> is still staying, one <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , a wooden <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and there was our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> all the time that the whole family were living together in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">QUESTION:  It must have been crowded?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Many families together and at least we got -- yes we got one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and a half of a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> together with a family of three men. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I forgot now their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">They came from Memille (ph), and they were talking between them German. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">We knew them before because when my father used to go to this area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Memille-Gebeit</span> (ph), it means the German part of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="621">He was staying in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Shvartze Adler</span> (ph), the Black Eagle, so he was one of the owners, his wife and a small child. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">The relations were not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">It beacuse first the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , afterwards also the mess -- we didn't become friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And they were living with us until the big action in October 28. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And the night after they didn't come back, so we earned, earned their <span class="NPIP">place</span> so now we had one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , but only we, and more than half <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , I think, two thirds of a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Davidowitz maybe was their name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">QUESTION:  Did you -- when you were forced out of the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , when you were forced out of the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I know that the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Were you aware of this? </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Could you see this? </span><span class="sentence" id="631">What was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">ANSWER:  I saw this but I didn't believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">QUESTION:  Tell me what you saw.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">ANSWER:  I saw a smoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">It was at the same time when all the Jewish from the Small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were taken to a big piatza (ph), or <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And after staying there half a day, we were all released to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">It was cold in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">That -- it was like it's a repetition of action. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Repetition, yes? </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Repetiton. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">It means to try how it works and there were many rumors why the Council did this action, or maybe, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Anyway, this time we come back we have seen a big smoke, and there was a rumor that this was <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">But I could not -- I couldn't understand that somebody is going to burn -- we didn't heard any voices. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I remember even now them -- two <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> , the color, it was yellow or white, or cream white of the -- of this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="645">So, there were rumors afterwards I heard they were burned and everything, but at the beginning I didn't want not to believe, because there were many rumors, and certain types of the rumors were not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">So, I also didn't receive this rumor, so I was not very much touched of this, what I have seen, smoke is smoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Only afterwards I was told and we also get the detailed information, but it took us several days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="648">QUESTION:  So, what had happened?</span></p>

QUESTION:  Where we stopped, you are now living in the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and I know you were there for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">What was life like there? </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Was there any semblance of normal activity? </span><span class="sentence" id="659">How -- did kids go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Did you observe Jewish holidays? </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Were people working? </span><span class="sentence" id="662">What was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="663">ANSWER:  I was living after we were expelled from the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , in what we call the Great Ghetto, it wasn't so great, but, I think we were about -- I was two and half years, two years, or two years -- two and half years, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">So, in the two and a half years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , what we call now the Big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> -- at the beginning I remember that we when we have leisure time, and we have some after the work, or it was a time I should not to go to work, because I was not 17 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">So, I found a certificate from my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> with a picture of me that I was born this and this year, this and this month. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">It means 27 of January 1925, it means that till 27th January 1942, I have not to go to work, because it was the beginning --17 years is the beginning of the first work. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">So, sometimes I did, I went to work instead of other people who paid me. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And such arrangement was called, I don't know why, a malach (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="669">A malach, it's in Hebrew or Yiddish, angel, and I was told that it was used during the period of the Czars that people were afterward with the Army and others could replace them for money, so I did it, and so I could help a little bit my family, myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">QUESTION:  What kind of work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">ANSWER:  Oh, work, usually very hard work, field work, or <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , and we have to under the sky- it means outside the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , 1t was winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">We were not -- it was very not convenient, unconvinient is also, I wouldn't say the whole truth, in water, in raining, in snowing, in cold, and not eaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">We were very hungry all the time, to be in the fresh air, young men, so it was no good. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">So, anyway, to coming back to your first question, several times we went when I had time to go around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- not around but in the center -- like to making a walk with friends or girlfriends. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">So, some <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> became like a <span class="DLF">promenade</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And as I remember it was around the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> of the Elderstrat, or the Comitet. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Because there come many people to -- for their business. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">To get another job, or to move in another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , or to ask for protection, so people met many people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">It was a concentration of people, a big crowd. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Some of them were talking politics and they were asking for news or talking -- telling or listening for rumors, and there were many, many rumors, good and bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So, it was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to coming and I remember also in this times people like to be dressed also well. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Not as the time when they went to work, so the impression was that people like to be normal as they can. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I remember also during these times it was the beginning of people who were selling some candies, some other things, homemade or other, and that was the beginning of a bigger production of such things in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">No, the beginning was cigarettes, people need cigarettes, especially in such a time of tension. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I think that also I begin to smoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">It was a need, or a fashion, I don't remember well. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Anyway, we tried to be more and more -- like to be normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">In these times I began also to keep a diary. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">The beginning I was writing the headline "Divrei Ha'Yamim" (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Divre1 Ha'Yamim, its means the events of the days. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">There is also in the Bible there is such a name of -- Chronicles it's called or something, so I -- the first I did note all the events was happened with us, with our family, or with the people of the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> from the beginning of the war till now, and I put also daydreams. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">I don't remember about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , maybe it was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , maybe not, because I was in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> anyway was not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but I heard that there are people who are -- not people but youngsters, younger than me, they are attending to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , and I am not missing too much because I was -- according for my age I have not to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="694">So I was -- I should be at the age between <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , let's say. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">That's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">But on your question, on the spirit of your question, I remember that people liked and also me, to be nice dressed more or less when you came <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="697">Even we were in the middle of atrocities. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">That I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">QUESTION:  Would -- when you say you tried to make life normal, what other ways? </span><span class="sentence" id="700">What other things did you do so that you'd feel that in the in the midst of all this you still had some enjoyment, or some control of your lives?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">ANSWER:  Oh, the control of our lives, that was to eat, to eat on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , even though it hungry to use a knife and a spoon, and a thing what we had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And you greet people on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and behave more or less as free people, not as prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Because prisoners have to go on the right side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and we had also to greet the German soldiers and of course the officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">So we -- and even to make nice our stars that we have to wore on -- here and on the back, in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> on the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">So, I remember that people had made it from yellow paper but some did it very nice on all their robes, some of silken and some made it either nice form, bit by bit, so it was a steady form. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Afterwards, the Germans decided shoul be very uniformal, that you cannot do what you want, it should be a special size and so on, but that I remember the trend, to do what we can.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">QUESTION:  To maintain dignity?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I don't know -- dignity, this I don't know nobody thinking, but normal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="710">QUESTION:  No, but you're talking about people taking some -- instead of just putting any yellow star on, that they attempted to personalize it?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="818">QUESTION:  I'm wondering if the Jewish police in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> gave any assistance to your organizations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="819">ANSWER:  Yes, the Jewish police did it, but I don't remember in which stage. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">I know, but not -- I don't remember, those are two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">It was at time for instance in 26th of October 1943, for me it was a critical day, because I lost my family this days. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">It was deportation to <span class="COUNTRY">Estonia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="823">At that morning, I -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">Nobody went to work outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I got mission, a certain mission to go in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to say a parole, a certain parole, I think that I remember the parole, and they sent me again in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="825">When they sent me, it was the beginning already of the deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And when I passed my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , my <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we were living, our <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> , I saw that a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> staying near the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and Jewish police and others, I don't remember who, maybe Lithuanian, or Estonian, or German are coming to take my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">I was passing very close let's say about ten, fifteen meters. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">They have seen me, I have seen them. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">My sister was very crying, very crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">My father was saying, in a position, or 1n a stride, "Everything 1s lost." </span><span class="sentence" id="831">He saw me and made such (gesturing). </span><span class="sentence" id="832">He didn't say it, but, "What we can do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="833">Only my mother she make me a strong wink with her eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">It means, "Go away!" </span><span class="sentence" id="835">and that was very, very important for me because yesterday the 26th of October was 51 years after this day, and I was thinking if she would not do it, maybe I would become again a good son and join the family where they are going. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">Because I didn't expect that they will be taken, and why? </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Because several days before, this my commander come to me and asking me, "I would like to know the names of your father, your mother, and your sister and others in your family and the name of the identity cards, number," and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Maybe she told me or I understood that the families of the underground people will be defended. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">So, when I saw that also they are taking I was shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">I was shocked, shocked twice, so maybe this agreement that maybe was done with the Elderstrat, with the authorities through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , didn't work, or maybe another thing, so that's a puncture. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">To think that my family they are taken so what makes the decision for me to go further, was this movement by the eye, a wink to the eye of my mother, that mother, Bluma Levin, born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wigoda</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="842">She did it and it give me a motivation to go farther and even not to look back. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">So, I went to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> I have to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">It was in a certain <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="845">It was called Blocktzai (ph), means Blocktzey (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And there I had to say a certain parole. "</span><span class="sentence" id="847">I want" -- the parole was, "I want to sleep here at night." </span><span class="sentence" id="848">In Yiddish it (speaking Yiddish), so the answer was, I don't remember, but now I'm coming to the your main question, I put it already together that in this day -- before this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was staying a policeman, his name was Daniel Billard (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="849">He was a known policeman because before the war he was a very known box-man. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Maybe he asking me the question or another man, so then I realized that the police or at least a part of the police is working in cooperation with the -- with the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">That makes me also a good feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And afterwards, I was told to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="853">I went -- a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="854">After I come to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , they opened a <span class="DLF">door</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> -- no the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> was with ashes or something or small stones. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">So, somebody took away the stones and told me to, "Go there." </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I think that I fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">So, I remember that some hands catched me and pulled me down and what it was dark, dark, very dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I can only fell --only see some fires of cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Very in silence, every half an hour was an order, move here, move there, or who wants to eat, who wants to go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="861">I don't know which -- I don't remember which arrangements they made. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">Who wants to smoke, who wants drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">One like with a chain. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">I am telling them and he is telling the other and so on and so on and a certain moment we felt that a noise, anoise, and somebody knocking on the iron cover of the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , "Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta," and people are calling and answering, maybe they are going to catch us and somebody telled them. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">They are still looking for people for deportation because in this day, many were hiding with me, but we made it an organized form. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">So, I felt myself better. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">I don't remember if somebody had arms or not, but I felt so secure and so good that somebody 1s taking care on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And really, after a few minutes, everything settled maybe and silent again. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">We were not -- I don't know because I don't remember if I looked of -- in my watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I have yet my watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">My watch that I get -- I received as a bar mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And when we had to come out it was already evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">In October the evening began early like now. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And we were told that now everybody is going for a while with family, "You are free but you have to come back very soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">Maybe this night we are leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , it means to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I become again very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">So, I went to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was empty without people, without my parents, without my sister, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And I have seen that some -- the neighbors, next door neighbors of my family by the name of Feen (ph) they were very surprised to see me, "How come you back?" </span><span class="sentence" id="880">because they were sure if my family was taken so also me. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And they gave me some to eat and to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">We were not in the best relations, but now we become very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">But I realize that many things are not in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so maybe my family took it, or maybe they took it, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">But it was for me -- I didn't care because if I are leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> this night it's for me all the same, and I took some sandwiches they gave me. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">I didn't tell them, but I told them that I will not more live here in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="886">I'm going away. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Maybe they understood, maybe not. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And when I come back to the place of concentration, 1t was in another <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stesbolyu</span> (ph) so we were told that this night nothing will happened and we have to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">We have to stay, so we decide to not to go more <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="890">Because what's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="891"><span class="BUILDING">Home</span> without parents is no <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , or sister, no <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="892">So, I was not the only one who was in such a situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">There were more, three, four, five, six. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">So, we stayed in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> and we sleep in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="896">We made arrangements to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">It was not in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> but under a <span class="DLF">roof</span> of a small <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="898">So, it was <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> for everybody and actually this was the beginning of a collective or a kibbutz, if you want, of a part of a members of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair and the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">Collective or kibbutz I don't

<p><span class="sentence" id="921">ANSWER:  The policeman was a uniformed policeman asked me a question that probably it was a part of the parole, the first part, "What do you need?" </span><span class="sentence" id="922">So my answer was, "I need here to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for sleep this night." </span><span class="sentence" id="923">In Yiddish it sounds other (speaking Yiddish), or (speaking Yiddish). </span><span class="sentence" id="924">So then, he understood and he showed me where to go in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And afterwards, there was many such cases that an open cooperation between the policemen and the organization, but sometimes this policeman also to fulfill orders for the Judenrat, for the Elderstrat in order to deport people and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">The policeman who took part of expelling or of deporting my family, I remember very good, because afterwards he was also a part of our organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">It was not in the middle of the organization, but he used to come to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , what we called, and I told him, "You know you are the man that took my family." </span><span class="sentence" id="929">So he told me, "Oh, why didn't you didn't say that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="930">I'm not sure that if I would say him thats could help but what happened to him, he also perished afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="931">QUESTION:  Do you know of any other examples of police helping or the Judenrst helping the underground organizations? </span><span class="sentence" id="932">Other ways?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="933">ANSWER:  I know many, but I remember very, very significant thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">When I have to leave -- not when I have, when I was allotted to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with all the ammunition and everything, at March 1944 at night through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , so at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were some people who were staying there all the time, all the -- even before and after, including they were some policemen, and they knew we were not going as it was reported by one of us that we are going <span class="NPIP">outside</span> like a team of work in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , but we are going to fight with partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">At this moment I saw also that these tremendous cooperations and the one moment the lights, it was electric were off. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">It was very dark, so even the German soldier or watchman could see something so it happens so that the conditions become very bad for realize who is who. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And that was done with a policeman there. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">Maybe there were more than one. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">Not only policeman, but also some officers of the Judenrat or Elderstrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">They were staying day and night at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and controlling the people who come to work and again and back, especially the people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arbeitzant</span> (ph), it was a work department. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">So, that I was sure -- so that I also saw, not that I only knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">Probably I was -- I knew about this before, 1t were rumors that somebody is going to help us and they had helping. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">We knew this, but here I saw myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="944">QUESTION:  It must have been very encouraging?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="945">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">No, but I was very encouraged. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">I didn't think too much of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">I was one step <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , so it's like going from the <span class="NPIP">hell</span> to <span class="NPIP">paradise</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="949">QUESTION:  I want to ask you a couple more questions and then I want to hear about your escape and your life in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="950">Did you have -- within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , did you have any special assignments or roles within the underground movement? </span><span class="sentence" id="951">Were there certain things that you had to do, to perform?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="952">ANSWER:  Not something. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">I was a private.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="954">QUESTION:  But did you deliver messages, did you go and get supplies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="955">ANSWER:  Yes, so that was very natural everything I did -- even I didn't remember them. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">But what I remember that I took all this very, very, very seriously to fill out well done job because it's a holy thing and I am devoted for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Yes -- I was thinking that after all this, no -- this organization belongs, maybe everybody belongs to this organization and there somewhere 1s sitting general staff, with maps and everybody's giving orders and they knew much better than me so I only have to full fill.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="958">QUESTION:  But what were the orders that you followed? </span><span class="sentence" id="959">What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="960">ANSWER:  What I have done, I remember I brought bottles, another day I brought also to bring money. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">Bring money.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="962">QUESTION:  From where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="963">ANSWER:  So I tried to sell something from a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and instead to buy bread or other food, I give it. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Or to go from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , or maybe to also steal some things for this organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">I remember now, lamps, electrical lamps, even used, they told to collect them and I knew that it's for make small bombs or grenades, primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Such things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="967">QUESTION:  You mentioned that you kept a diary. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Do you think a lot of other people at this time were keeping diaries?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="969">ANSWER:  If you're asking me if I think, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">QUESTION:  You know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="972">QUESTION:  At the time were you aware of --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="973">ANSWER:  At the time I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Nobody told me because people doesn't -- didn't tell too much because that can be -- that can be dangerous for somebody if it would be found, nobody knows if it's good for him or for his family and maybe it's also not good because now his family will know -- so, no, it was very, very privately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="975">QUESTION:  Now you know, I mean, I've looked through the Kovno ghetto diary by Mr. Torey, were a lot of other people keeping diaries as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="976">ANSWER:  Yes, a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">For him it was very easy because he --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="978">QUESTION:  I need you to say Avraham Tory.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="979">ANSWER:  Avraham Tory, that his former last name was Golup (ph) and he was the secretary of the Judenrat or Elderstrat, according my knowledge, for him it was very easy to keep a diary for one <span class="NPIP">side</span> many, many information and also documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">He had sometimes only to copy them in the -- put in his diary. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">On the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> he should have had more <span class="NPIP">places</span> to hide them because everybody knows that he's writing and that it was for his daily work, so he had not to be so keeping in silence because nobody would interfere with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">End of Tape #3 Tape #4
QUESTION:  If you can just very briefly repeat to me what it was that the Jewish policeman said to you that indicated he knew what was going on so that I understand that word parole.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="983">ANSWER:  So change the word parole and password.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="984">QUESTION:  You can say parole or password, but I need you to begin by saying the policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">It's a full sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="986">ANSWER:  So, the policeman who were a very close to the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> on their Block C or Block Tze (ph) as we called it, I knew him before. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">I knew even his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">His name was Daniel Billard (ph) and his question was (speaking Yiddish), 1t means, what do you need here? </span><span class="sentence" id="989">I understood I knew it before that this is the beginning of a password, we called it parole. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">So, the answer on this password, or the parole was, "We have -- we get here or we have here to sleep this night." </span><span class="sentence" id="991">In Yiddish it sounds (speaking Yiddish) mir or I, I don't remember well, anyway to sleep here, so he was satisfied because this was the true parole and he let me in to come and maybe show me also the way to go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> or in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> that I don't remember very good but afterwards somebody opened a cover on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and they also to put away the stones that were under this cover and I felt that I am falling down, down, down, until several hands caught me and they bring me to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to a certain <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="992">It was dark there, that what I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="993">QUESTION:  The other question I have is, I assume there were also <span class="INT_SPACE">Communists cells</span> or other groups and I'm wondering if you -- the different groups worked together or if they had separate responsibilities in terms of helping people get supplies or get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="994">Do you know -- what did you know about that at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="995">ANSWER:  At that time, we knew that we are not the only, that the other groups were organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">We called them several names one name was the Communist or the Mushtas (ph), because of Joe Stalin. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">Ofdevantzes (ph), or Coatkes (ph), Coatkes means short jackets, overjackets, coats, but short. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">But we knew that they doesn't belong to us, they belong to the left-left and some of them we knew even before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="999">Some change their <span class="NPIP">places</span> , come from the Zionists to the Communists and why? </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">Because as we understood, they are more than we. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">They are a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">And one of them it was very known his name was Chaim Yellin (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">He was a very known figure even in all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , even outside the organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">We knew also or maybe we had the feeling that they has the best connections <span class="NPIP">outside</span> with the partisans and probably I was told, probably it was my feeling, but we knew that they are the prominent people in the organization or their organization 1s more important than ours in the terms of communication with <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">We knew the partisans can be only Soviet partisans because other partisans will not deal with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">And if Soviet partisans, it's Communists, so again, so they felt themselves very strong in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> even to be a Communist in this time was very dangerous for the Germans and for the Lithuanians because several times they were looking after such people in order to arrest them and to kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">But in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> it was like in autonomy everybody could -- it was like a big shelter in terms of politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">So, they felt themselves very good and very secure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">Even more when we had to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , so it was a rumor between us that they are having a preference to go and also their girls, or girlfriends, or wives will get a better -- a better position, or they had not to wait so long as our girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">And I will not forget one thing that one of our girls, were organized in Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzai, we were living this time already in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communa</span> , in the collective, it was -- the name was Mildos (ph) 7, because the <span class="DLF">street</span> was Mildos and the number of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was 7. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">So it was called Milda 7 everybody, not everybody, but many knew that that belonged to Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">The Communists have also their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> not far from us and also ABC, Abetze (ph) Irgun L'Tzion (ph) has their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">So, the developments of all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> was similar. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">People were alone without parents, without families, decide to live together and it was also convenient for the organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">Everybody can catch all his -- all their members at one time and they have control and they can also hide their arms and make training with arms, so it was good for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">So, I'm coming back to one of our girls which belonged to Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, her name was Rosa, Rosa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">She was already taken to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> in order to be included in a group -- I don't remember the number of the group -- going by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">She was taken away at the last moment, and instead her was put in a girl of the -- what we called them Communist and they are calling no or even the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> they have a cover name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">It was called Anti-Facists Fight Organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">So, they have a preference and when we come, I come to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> I found a lot of people who belonged to their organizations and of -- from us were only I think eleven or twelve with one, only one girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">For girls 1t was generally more difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">It's because the high command of the partisans is Ruditsky, or Rudniky for us, demand they give preference for men, male good who trained not with revolvers but with long rifles, long rifles mean long arms and better males than females. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">The ghetto organization had another pressure to do what they demand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">So, it all the time were compromise, here, there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">Anyway, the last decision that - the factor let's say, was that most of the girls, Jewish girls and these detachments, and I am talking about the detachments, Kovno detatchments in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ruditsky Forest</span> which was called this to the German occupants that most of the girl did belong before to the Communist circles or what was called Anti-Facist Fighter Organizations, that is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1026">QUESTION:  Were the non-Communists organizations more effective with working with the Jewish community in terms of getting supplies or <span class="INT_SPACE">hiding spaces</span> or money or anything than the anti-facist organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1027">ANSWER:  The Zionist organizations, and there are several, one of them it was very big, it was --
QUESTION:  What about the Zionist organizations in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1028">ANSWER:  The Zionist organizations, and I am talking mostly about their underground organizations because there were many organizations like parties, but they belong to more adult people, but talking about the youth movements, the Zionist youth movements of -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno Ghetto</span> , we are talking about three main organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">It Irgun Brei Tzion (ph), organization of bright young braves, any way now we would call them general Zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">It included also religious Zionists, liberal Zionists and so on, that's one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">The other was what I mentioned before Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, and Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair with the time where we coordinated with Ha'Chalutz Ha'Tzair, or Dror (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">It was more or less also ideological very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">So they afterwards established the collective of the kibbutz together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">What I mentioned Mildos Sheva (ph), <span class="BUILDING">Mildos 7</span> was together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">I would call it in one word the --as it means the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> of the Zionists.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1036">QUESTION:  I need to understand something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">What you're telling me is that most of the underground in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was young people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1038">ANSWER:  Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1039">QUESTION:  What about people who were 30 years old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1040">ANSWER:  Thirty year old, they're very on the <span class="DLF">border</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1041">QUESTION:  Will you say just as a complete sentence that the underground in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno Ghetto</span> was young people, if you can just make a statement like that and then continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1042">ANSWER:  Continue, or come back to describe -- maybe it's too complicated what I'm talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1043">QUESTION:  I think what you can is that the underground -- because I don't think people know this -- was really young people and that if you then kind of go and say the Zionist organizations maybe had better cooperation with the community, or I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1044">ANSWER:  I am coming to this, but first of all, it's important to describe who they are, who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">So, we are talking about underground in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno Ghetto</span> , maybe also other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> ,we are talking mostly about young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">Young people it means maybe from 15, 16 till 30. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">If they were more,they were exeptions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">And I will tell you who were the Zionists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">They were divided into three or four groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">They were the general Zionists and the organization was called Abetze, Irgun Brei Tzion (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">In this organization were also included some of religious Zionists, Bnei Akiva (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">After -- the other was Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, and they with a time unified with the Dror or Ha'Chalutz Ha'Tzair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">It also left workers' organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">They were very, very close ideologically, and they established the collective or the kibbutz called Mildos Sheva (ph), Mildos 7. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">Sheva, it means seven in Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">We used very much to talk Hebrew also in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">Therefore I am mentioning sheva, so it's important; it reminds me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">The other group was Beitar. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">Beitar and other people were incorporated in this ideology that's three. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">And probably we can also include to this organizations Brit Tzion (ph), were adult people let's say from 30 till 60 or more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">It was an organization who helped the Abetze, who were young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">So, if talking about young people about the really underground organization who were prepared to do more or less everything then we are talking about organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">The ABC, Abetze, not ABC, Irgun Brei Tzion, Ha'Chalutz Ha'Tzair and Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, and Beitar -- they were very involved in the life of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because their establishment of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was also Zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">If you will take Dr. Elkous and his deputy of the Elderstrat, Leib Garfunkel (ph) and the others were former activists or top members or leaders of the Zionist organizations in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">So, it happen so also the staff of the Elderstrat in all of officer were sitting people more Zionists than all the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">So that it was natural that they could help with many things their organization, the underground organization, with money, with means, with transportation, and what's most important, with covering them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">I mean, the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">The Jewish Ghetto Police. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">I remember that our organization, also we sent some of our members to be organized in the police in order that they can help us, they can tell us what is going and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">Even there was one, two, or four people who belong to the Communist organization who also sent to serve in the police, in the Jewish Police in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">Anyway, the partition of work became so, or it happened without our planning so our planning was the Zionist organization were more active in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because they are close to the Elderstrat, they know many things they can get help on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">The Communist, the Anti-Facist Fight Organization they have very good connections with the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , with the partisans, with the Communists outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">And so it was a very good combinations between the two big parts, contra parts of one big organization with that they should have one <span class="DLF">roof</span> in a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> it was called, in a certain time it was called the MTC it means Military Technical Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1074">QUESTION:  When was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1075">ANSWER:  Oh, it was in 1943, in this time when the topic of going to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> was very, very -- had become very hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">So, it was natural and it was also coordination between the two big parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">It was a coordination until a certain point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">For instance, who will go if it will be in each group? </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">Each group, a certain group is able to take 20 people, who will be the 20? </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">So it -- maybe it was a key, it was called a political key or organizational key, 15 from this <span class="NPIP">side</span> and 5 from this <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and if girls, so the most girls were from the Communist and we took it for granted that it cannot be others, this is, and they were begging, I don't know how it was done but we could feel 1t and even when I have to go, so I could not go with others, I have to wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">I remember there was a group which left before me from Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair and Ha' Chalutz Ha'Tzair, they left, I guess, in January 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">I have to wait another two months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">It was also a question with rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">Who will give me a rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">I cannot go in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and buy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">So, I decide very easily to sell my watch, my hand- watch, I remember even the firm, it was Tiso (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">I saved it for bar mitzvah for my Uncle Moses and I gave it to a certain man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">He brought me money, I give the money my - the activist of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, I remember the name, his name was Eli Rausuk (ph), and one day he told me, "It's settled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">When you go, you will go with a rifle." </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">Of course I was very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">Other things like boots, high boots, because without high boots you cannot go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">It's like arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">He went with me this guy, Eli Rausuk, like a big brother or like a father, until we got two good boots fit for my legs, for my feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">And afterwards, he went with me to a tailor in order to make for me an overcoat also, half to here, because you cannot go with a long coat in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">And also equipment and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">He went with me mostly to the workshops in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">Also, the management of the workshop was helping the partisan organizations, and the coordination, we understood that it was made in the high level between the management of the workshops the organization -- underground organization and somebody in the Elderstrat or the Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">Anyway, when I went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , I was very good equipped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">Also, with cigarettes and tobacco and with underwear and with a rugsack, a sack to put my things, a raincoat and even with a white shirt, no not shirt, a white -- you know, in order to -- a white manufacturer, I would -- in order to use it when we are going in an area of snow so we could very nice to make all camouflage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">It was -- they did the best. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">They did the best, and it also give me a very good feeling that somebody 1s taking care on me because I was alone, without family, without nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">And I have also to mention a party before this in our collective, singing songs and drinking even vodka but of course they told we have to accustom ourselves to the life in the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">And I remember one or two people come from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , from the groups who left before and come to make us -- to give us instructions how to behave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">With arms and with other things, and also how to use a password, we called it a parole. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">And some was in Russian, not everybody knew the Russian language. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">We knew more or less, but in order not to be lost, and also that a good partisan must to drink vodka, not to be an exception. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">He have to accustom himself with all the life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">And they gave us a lot of advice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">How to handle when it happens so, and when it happens so, what to do, and afterwards these two guys took us to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and they become our guides.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1110">QUESTION:  Now, I want to hear all about that escape to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">So, I want you to tell me -- actually I'm thinking of one other question and maybe you can make the answer brief, but I know in the beginning I think this important, I know in the beginning you were operating in very small <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">Nobody knew what anybody else was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">There were three, maybe five people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">All of a sudden you're in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">commune</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">At what point in time did all of this change and how?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1116">ANSWER:  After the 26th of October 1943 when we meet a big number of the organizations, not one, met together in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hideout</span> , in the Block C after we could make lights in the evening, so we saw many people I know one body, somebody knew me but we're from different organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">And from then, it was no more secrets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">We kept other secrets, where we were hiding, arms and so on and some but the belonging to the organization was no more secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">Of course we kept many things, when we are going, and other things, and our destination, our direction, even we didn't know exactly, only the last two days we were kept in a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and then we get the last instructions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">From there we could not go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">It wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , no more, and then we were given, very secret things that if you are lost and you are alone what do you have to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1122">QUESTION:  So, how did you get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">Try to remember and describe for me your escape from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1124">ANSWER:  Oh, I will never forget it in my life, because I-- our coming out was postponed several times and we become -- I would say, nervous or maybe it will not fulfilled because it was like a dream, like a dream, and a good dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">So one or two or some hours we have to wait again and to come again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">I don't know what happened and why, but I trust the organization like it would be God, for a religious man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">So, 1t comes the moment when they call, "Okay, now you have to go to the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">They prepared us, I think, with numbers that not altogether will climb, and so it will not make disorder there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">So, on the <span class="DLF">track</span> , I saw two soldiers, German soldiers with uniform, maybe they belong to the police or Wehrmacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">After a few minutes I realize these are two from our group, and they make like they would be our escorts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">So, I had really to admire organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">If they are so clever, so sophisticated that they can prepare everything, so I hope it will be everything good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">And we heard that somebody's asking questions at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , police or other and then at certain times electricity was short, closed in order to make that nobody can watch us and so on and somebody was asking, "Where are you going?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">so another voice answer, "Yes, these men are going to work in the brigade of Baptai (ph)," a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> where Jewish use to work there, hard work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">And we moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">They all begin to walk and we felt more than happy, but in a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> not far from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">We have to be very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">Not to questions or nothing, and what's important, not to take with us things that can make evidence that we were Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , other Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">For example, I have to leave the pictures from my family and from me of course, many things and not one word written in Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">If I would be religious so I could not take with me , no, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">So I'm coming again when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> stopped and we hear again voices, here and there, talking Lithuanian, talking Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">After a few moments somebody saw a big sack with -- that was about ten or fifteen rifles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">I don't remember how it was -- how I get one of them, but I did and by this moment or maybe before, we had a commander and a comissar, it was political commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">No, I think the commander was one of the people who should be our guide to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , because he came several times there and here and he knows, and should know every stone on the <span class="DLF">highway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">So, in certain moment he told us, "Now you are taking off your red stars and putting them in a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> ," or maybe eating them -- I don't remember, and he told, "Now you are partisans." </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">We have guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">We have maybe hiding in certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> because it also can be against us if somebody is coming to make a search, but maybe not because we have all our rifles and now we can now do something, we can defend ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">So, we went very far about 40 or 50 miles and you have to stand up and then we have to stand in a <span class="DLF">line</span> and we were walking by foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">To put our white shirt or lining, I don't know how to call it in English, big white things, we put it so they -- we could not be very easy watched because this <span class="REGION">area</span> was with snow and we went, and we went, and many miles and we had heavy packs with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">We also have not private packs but things to take for the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , for the bases, maybe a radio, maybe other things, maybe medicaments for the small <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> that we had in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , maybe other things, maybe it calls for -- I don't remember but it was very heavy to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">I remember some of the people collapsed on the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1153">QUESTION:  How many were there with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1154">ANSWER:  Oh, we were a very big group, I think 28, and we have --
QUESTION:  Men and women?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1155">ANSWER:  Men and women and we have -- I remember everybody has a gun, two have machine guns, and one has an automatic rifle, that's called a sedete (ph) in the Russian terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">Even the girls had guns, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">And also it was heavy to have the gun and the pack. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">So, at night we come to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and we were told that we have not to go in only one -- everybody in one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> not in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> but in the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">Excuse me, it was not -- it was at day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">At night we have to go, to go and to go and to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">At day, we come to a certain <span class="BUILDING">house</span> like a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , let's call it <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">So everybody come to this <span class="DLF">farm</span> we weren't allowed to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">Till the evening, we have collected about twenty people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">So it was a neighbor come to see his neighbor. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1165">You are very nice, you are our neighbor but you cannot leave." </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">You know, it is because he cannot go and tell the police, and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">Nobody 1s leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">Afterwards come his wife to look after him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">What is he doing, my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">Maybe he's drinking or maybe other things, so she come also. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1171">You will stay with your husband." </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">Sometimes you saw kids, and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">As evening, a lot of people with us, and at this time some of us could relax and to sleep by a certain order. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">Some were staying with the rifle and hand radio that everything can't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">And so we make it like two or three days until we come to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">Yes, and before we come to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> we have to cross a very critical point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">It was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railways</span> were very watched by the Germans because it was a very strategic thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">Anyway we have to make operation to send people here and there and to watch the Germans will not come here, and we did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">After that we have to cross a <span class="DLF">highway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">Also, more or less the same tactic and then we were told now we are in the partisan area. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">Partisan area. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">Also, we have to go with the arms, but you feel yourself to be more free, not be in tension so much more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">But, for me it was another tension. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">If we are already in the kingdom of the partisans, so it's the tension of be proud of, joy, to be glad, to be happy, you can use many words for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">Sometimes I have seen signs on <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , heavy <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> with <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamps</span> around them and sometimes we have to go on a very narrow <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> which was lying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">So, as it moved like in a story, or films that we have seen about the partisans after the October revolution in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and we have seen sometimes on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> signs red, or white, or together so I was sure that it's for us, somebody put this for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">I was so trusting of the organizations, the partisans, not more of the organization of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">It was another authority for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">So, I was very high there, like I was took drugs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">One moment we saw a man with a big, full hat, a Papacha (ph) it's called, of <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , with an automatic arm and he told us a password, in Russian parole. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">He didn't know, but our guys they knew, before they told him so he come smiling to us, "You're partisans," and he shook hands with everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">But we have to go farther and farther, and we were exhausted, especially the girls and we have also weak people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">Some people are very strong <span class="NPIP">outside</span> but here it was a hero who can make the way can also be a . </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">Until we come to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">bases</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">bases</span> also we have to pass a guard but this guard was already one that we know from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , our man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">Now also, we were kissing everybody and he had to leave us and to told that the group came from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">He himself could let us come <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">He did it, he went, and the other was watching us, it must be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">And afterward come the commander of the attachment and invited us all with greetings, "Now you can come in, you can come." </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">And that was a big celebration. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">Everybody was asking me what happened with my uncle, with my girlfriend, and so on, the other thing, "Have you tobacco?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">or maybe it was the first question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">I was very large and everybody I gave my tobacco so tomorrow I have nothing to smoke for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">But it was a very, very, very happy meeting, until its come to a finish and everybody has another friend to ask look we have other music it's not so nice, it's very hard to be a partisan and that already perished and that were already taken as prisoner of war by Germans and we knew what it means to be in prisoners a German, and partisan, and even a Jew, and that sometimes there are anti-Semitic incidents even between the partisans and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">But we were talking half the night until we asleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1207">QUESTION:  Now, when you met with these other people in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , were they all Jews, were they Soviet partisans? </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">I'm wondering who these other people were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">Were they all part of your organization?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1210">ANSWER:  This time, and we are talking about March, 1944, and detachments of to the occupants in Russian it's so it can be translated "Death to the occupants or the conquerors," in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">So, it was a mixed unit from two or five or three paratroopers, they were the nucleus of this detachment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">Lithuanian, or Russian, people before Communists and they were parachuted into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> in order to establish this detachment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">A big part were former prisoner of wars, Russian, who escaped from their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , P.O.W. camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">And a big part, I think in the beginning the people of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> made about 60, if not more percent, coming more and more and more till a day what from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> nobody could no more join us for internal things that happened in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , so this turning point afterward we become less and less and less.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1215">QUESTION:  And you said there were incidents of anti-Semitism, even with the partisans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1216">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1217">QUESTION:  Did you experience any of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1218">ANSWER:  I have, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">First at all, I heard the word ours and yours. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">What does it mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">For me everybody was now somebody very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">We are fighting together, and there, ours and yours. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">And I've seen that also they are living in the same -- incertain concentration of Jewish partisans and un-Jewish, not formal, but de-facto. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">So, I have another example. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">One of our guys, he was, he come really with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">A nice boy, a tall boy, he was dead because he ate too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">He was hungry too much and something happened to his stomach and he passed away so we buried him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">So, what happened, it comes only the commissar and made a speech, "Ta, ta, ta, ta," and from the fighters they are not only Jewish fighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">That's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">There were other things, but I'm not sure if 1t was anti-Semitism or not, some partisans, Jewish partisans, were shot by their comrades on the way to a certain missions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">They came without them and told a story there that was very suspicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">End of Tape #4 Tape #5
QUESTION:  How long were you in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> fighting with the partisans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1233">ANSWER:  I was till the first week of July 1944, and then --
QUESTION:  I'm sorry I want to hear a whole sentence, so say I was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1234">ANSWER:  I was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , or better, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rudniky Forest</span> , as partisan till July 1944, the 9th of July we heard the thunder of the big guns, the artillery, the Katusha of the Red Army, or the Soviet Army, so we knew that -- and we knew also from other sources from radio or so, that the Red Army or the Soviet Army is coming back to this <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">So, we were told also we will go like to help the big army to help them to liberate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> was very close to us about 20 miles or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">But then happened a certain event that was for us, for me personally, very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">The 9th of July early in the morning come to us a girl partisan from the Wilno detachment which were located not far. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">We were all the time, we had, I would say, unlegal relations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">She was also from Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">She was sent by Abba Kovner (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">Abba Kovner was the commando of the Wilno detachment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">Her name was Ruska Kolchak (ph), a very known partisan. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">She told -- came half secretly to us and told us, "You have to go now as we are doing, you will come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> , but when you come, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> , please don't leave the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">You will be in a new organization with the aim of to go immediately by all means we can to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">And we were -- it was very logical for us and it was not big surprise and we left the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and we come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> and then was the beginning of a new organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">Afterwards, this organization gets the name Bricha (ph), it means escaping. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">And I was working for the archives of the internal ministry of Soviet Union, it's called Ainkavede (ph), yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">I was very proud that they took me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">They took me because I knew several languages and I was intelligent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">So, I attended <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , so they took me, and I was working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">One of my jobs was to make use from the material the Germans left, papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">And I did it with pleasure because I found them very interesting material, even some reports from the Germans made on our activity of my detachments. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">We also found list of names of Lithuanian soldiers and policemen who took part in killing Jewish people, so I was again very happy that I can do some important thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">But at the same time, we were building another unlegal organization to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">And one of this was to prepare false documents to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> -- not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> but by tracks or by foot or by any means to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernovtsy</span> , it means in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucovina</span> in the south, southwest of <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">From there to smuggle the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and there we were told maybe that we can find a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">That's close enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , or from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucuresti</span> was about 1,000 kilometers, it's 900 miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">So, we did it bit by bit man after man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> , I left my job, I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> , I left my arms, with a girlfriend from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , with her small sister like we are a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">I am the father, she is the mother and the small sister is our daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">It makes less dangerous for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">We get also a card, how to go from which <span class="NPIP">place</span> to which <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to whom to apply and what will be our passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">And we did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">And for instance, I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> I think the 19th of January 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">It means a half year after I left the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">I didn't want to come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> because I hate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> because every man in the <span class="DLF">street</span> was a killer of my family or other of my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> was for me more neutral, for me personally, and the other thing that we were told also not to go far because if somebody needed us and I had the opportunity to go and our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was to leave very fast this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , this lousy country of anti-Semitism and killers and all the bad things that I suffered, not only me but our whole communities, whole generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">So, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baranovichi</span> , I'm talking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Byelorussia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baranovichi</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koval</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koval</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volpe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">In each <span class="NPIP">place</span> we found a man he some give us to eat, sometimes also to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">Sometimes we slept <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on a <span class="DLF">roof</span> of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , but we did it and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> it is <span class="REGION">Galicia</span> or <span class="REGION">west Ukraine</span> , then we met with some girls partisans we can call them liaison officers, L-I-A-S-O-N, so one of them, I remember was Zelda, she was also, she did such a job also between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno ghetto</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> and we went -- and we were sleeping in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish library</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , by there were two -- were several people, more and more and they have to go farther. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">So we heard one day that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernovtsy</span> one of the groups were caught and put into the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">If so, the way is closed to that and we were talking it's burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">If so, we have to go to chose an alternative <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">I even was sent for a while to other <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the south, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stansislav</span> , it's also the area of <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , in order to make sure what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernovtsy</span> because -- anyway I come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> it's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lemburg</span> , so I give a report and we decided to go straight from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">To go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> we have to take new documents that we are Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">So we made it, we crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> and the next day we were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pshemysl</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Peremyshl</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">There we also have to wait for several weeks, two weeks or three weeks and we made also a new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">We are living together and tried to go farther, also to make new documents because we didn't talk Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">In <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , the Jewish people, our generation, doesn't understand Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">Even not to talk, and if you are talking, everybody will see that we are foreigners and that was very dangerous because we escaped from the Soviet Union and that only traitors are doing or enemies of the people and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">They will catch us and they will send us to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , 1f not to shoot us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">So, we went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pshemysl</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zeshev</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zeshev</span> we did a very fine thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">We went to the commander, or chief office of the county governor, Starosta (ph), Polish, and we told him that we are partisans who were from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> and have to go to our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">And we were talking between us Lithuanian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">A little bit of Yiddish and we -- the rabbi of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zeshev</span> , he knew the truth and he was translator. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">Before coming to this man, the governor, we make on our hands numbers like we were prisoners of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">We do it with very easy ink, the next day we could take it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">And we showed, "You see?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">He told, "Here are the people." </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">And we showed, "Here." </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">So he gave us immediately, he was a very nice man, "Oh <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , good." </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">It was an incident he would -- he want that we will meet a really group from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> and so we were very afraid they will recognize that we are not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">So, we said, "No, we are very tired and we have to go immediately." </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">He gave us documents and we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zeshev</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> , it means already <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1299"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cluj</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Klausenberg</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cluj</span> we took express <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucuresti</span> because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucuresti</span> was former <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and we trust that from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucuresti</span> we can go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Constanta</span> to the <span class="DLF">port</span> and then to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucuresti</span> probably the KGB or other services were following us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">And we have to move, we have to move and we heard that in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> is a Jewish brigade from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> so that could be a good way we thanks them to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">So we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">And after being three months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> , also we were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutzim</span> , oh, we were very -- not only from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> also from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and other <span class="NPIP">places</span> everybody was safe to remember that that is the best way to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , but only for us former citizens from <span class="REGION">Soviet Russia</span> , because <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> was a part of <span class="REGION">Soviet Russia</span> , was so dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">So we decided we are going to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> so we went back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucuresti</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cluj</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cluj</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chambatoy</span> (ph), from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saltzburg</span> , that means <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">In <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> we have to cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> again to the <span class="REGION">area</span> which belonged to the British Army, means <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">Also we have again to cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> and we were arrested several times by the Russians, patrols, and they took us here and took us back and everytime we have another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">In each pocket we have another document, other names, and we have to remember all the names all the nicknames, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">So, we come to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1309"><span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> we come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarviso</span> (ph), it's on the <span class="DLF">border</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">We came the 15th or 14th of July 1945, and that was a big, big festival. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">What happened, many leaders from the survivors come there then we met Mr. Garfunkel, who was a member of the Elderstrat, and he was so nice received by the soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">Some of them were from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> who emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> many years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">They knew he was a very prominent man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">Afterwards was Abba Kovner from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> , and maybe also <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tzivia</span> (ph) -- no, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tzivia</span> we met on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">Anyway, it was a big, big festival now, and from there we have yes, and Abba Kovner sent me for another emissary back to the Russians in order to show -- to be a guide for three soldiers from the Jewish brigade who want to go back to their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">I don't know if they deserted for a certain time or get permission, but he was sure that if I made the way several times I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">I didn't know, but I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">I didn't know the way, but somehow I did it and come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">When I come back I told more I will not go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">I would like to come here to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and finish with all the tasks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">Iam a private man now, so I was put in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> of young people with the supervision of Jewish soldiers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mestre</span> (ph), <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mestre</span> it very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Venice</span> , and we spend there a very nice Rosh Hashana, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Venice</span> , in the Nafi (ph) of the English Army, with a chaplain, evrything, very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">The Jewish soldiers become our parents of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">One day I was told that, "You because you are already on the way a long time, you are chosen with another one to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">It was in the middle of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">Everything, you know, secretly and so and so, underground noise, and you're underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">Underground of the Bricha, that's made by <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> -- Palestine guys together with Jewish soldiers from the Brigade, or other soldiers, it was another mafia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">So, we went all the night by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Venice</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barre</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">It's all <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , maybe took more than one night, I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">But we come -- it was in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">We were put in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a very secret camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">We could not go out because it was secretly and the Italians should not know who we are.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1332">QUESTION:  How many were there of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1333">ANSWER:  Oh, we were then about 250 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">Also from other groups because it was like a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">stream</span> , which is going and when the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">stream</span> is coming near <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">stream</span> becomes bigger and bigger and bigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">So, we met people from other <span class="NPIP">places</span> even they come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">They were the real <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , not like me with a false number. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">And even from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and from many <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">I told you it's like a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , it's coming, it's coming, but this <span class="NPIP">place</span> we were isolated -- even not to buy a wine from the peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">They have a good wine for us, it was very important so we did, at night we did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">But we lost our patience and one day they took several guys from us, I think there were 180, and took us also by night -- at night to a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> , a <span class="DLF">hiding port</span> , a small <span class="DLF">port</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trento</span> (ph), this is south of, south of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and there was waiting for us a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">A small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , like half of a normal <span class="BUILDING">tennis place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">We were 180 people and when we come to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> it is also by certain order. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">It reminds me when I come to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> in order to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">I wrote it afterwards also in my diary that it's the same sensation I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">Anyway we were took on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was very small, but in such a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there were about five or six floors of <span class="NPIP">places</span> to sleep, like in a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">Every man has so much <span class="NPIP">place</span> and it was -- I can't describe -- 1t was made like in a <span class="BUILDING">field hospital</span> when somebody is carrying you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">So, it was such --

<p><span class="sentence" id="1396">QUESTION:  How long was this journey from the time that you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> and you made the decision until the time you actually came ashore in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , how many months?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1397">ANSWER:  The decision was made in the 9th of July, 1944, but it was only a decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">But the really journey began the 19th of January 1945 and finished the 23rd of October 1945, so it means about ten months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1399">QUESTION:  I want to ask you one more question, and it's a little bit of a different way of thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">You've had many experiences over the last 40 years in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and that's for another time, but you rebuilt your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">You have a very fascinating life in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">Are there influences from your boyhood in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> that you think are still a part of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1403">ANSWER:  Boyhood, you mean --
QUESTION:  The time you're growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1404">ANSWER:  You mean till the Holocaust or after, because you cannot put --
QUESTION:  Not after so much, but I mean you came from a strong culture or strong community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , family, friends, religion, how much did that influence what you became later on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1405">ANSWER:  Oh, I think that my childhood and what you call boyhood, is a new word for me, I never heard it, but I like it, it, I think it's a continuity, nothing happened because when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> I found many of my family of my uncles, aunts, cousins, classmates who did it before from the organization from Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, so it was a <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">A <span class="DLF">road</span> that everybody will do it before or after, so for me it was so natural, only what happened, the Holocaust and all the things after and maybe also include the Soviet time 1940 and 1941, it was something out the order for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">But to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> what for me it was like two and two are four.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1408">QUESTION:  I was just wondering if there was anything especially unique in your growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> that --
