<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Helene Barac, Helene D. Barac. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> in 1933 in April. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I know that my parents at the time lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Namure</span> (ph) that's it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Your parents were from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  No, my parents were both Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My mother and father were both born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madava</span> (ph), which at that time was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Disrabia</span> (ph), and came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , I guess in about 1928. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">So actually on their way to <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My father had a Ph.</span><span class="sentence" id="10">D in chemical engineering and was a paper expert. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And they stopped, had dinner at somebody's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , who had invited a man who is in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">paper mills</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , they were naturalized. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And, this man and my dad got along very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He offered my dad a job and asked my mom how she liked the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and she said she loved it, and there we were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  What do you remember of your life in Belgtum before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Normalcy, a great deal of normalcy. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We lived -- it was very old fashioned but the people who worked at my dad's <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> were separated between the workers and the -- what do you call them -- the managers. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And they all lived in <span class="BUILDING">complexes</span> , and where we lived which is where the managers would live, was the <span class="DLF">street</span> with a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> behind it and a square, not too far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And I was not allowed to go play on the square. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And on Sundays we would climb up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And other than that, I was allowed to talk to people on my <span class="DLF">street</span> and play with their dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">None of them had children. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> at the same time every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I got up at the same time every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I was fed basically the same food every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Very, very normal untramatic life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  Did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  No brothers, no sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I had a lot of cousins who I saw quite a bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  What about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Oh, I don't remember much about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> except that I loved my teachers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  Was it a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> or a ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  I don't remember that there were any other Jews in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manue</span> (ph) where we lived, and I know there were no other Jews in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> from the things that my parents have said to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  And did that cause any confusion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">My parents were both and I was brought up with no consciousness of being Jewish at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">One of my sets of cousins was terribly terribly Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And, I remember thinking it's kind of a silly waste of time to have to spend so much time praying and going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and all that, because it's their business. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And my other cousins who weren't Jewish were really not practicing Jews in the same way that we wete.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  Was there any conscious -- political consciousness about ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  No, my parents were both -- I guess they both felt -- especially my dad, that they belong to the Russian Italian Embessy. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I guess that my mother didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">My mother was really very high politicalized person, but she was much broader, my father was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And my father belonged to that category of Jews who had aligned themselves with the Russian Communist Party to a ereat extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And really thought of themselves as Russians not as Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And felt that they had been totally accepted in the world of Russians on . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">That is what he felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And so one of my uncles had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Pakistan</span> and came back and was disappointed in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I never met him really from the time I was a child until the time I was an adult, I was never really able to talk to him about his feelings or his experiences in <span class="COUNTRY">Pakistan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Now my other uncle had run a communist army and went out and fought in the army and stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  The reason I am asking this is I am trying to get a sense of how the weren't practicing at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">What really -- how you identified with being Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I didn't until I was in my teens. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Until way way after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">As far as I could see there were the Germans and they were the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And then there were all the French speaking people. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And they were the good guys that included the French and the Belgitums. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And then of course, the Flemish (ph) Belgtums. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And, I wasn't really too conscious of the Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">But I was conscious of the British as being the good guy which was a little bit confusing later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Because, I knew that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wellington</span> was the bad guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">My historical concepts got very very mixed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But at that time the British were good and the French were super good and the Germans were super bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And so I really put down all the horrors of war to the conflict between the good guys and the bad guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And I wasn't really conscious of the bad things that they were doing to the Jews because they were equally bad things to people that I knew and saw around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Now by the time we got to the South of France and I got myself situated or I didn't, my history did. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I got me situated in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where there were many many Jews living as well, even though I still considered myself French. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I began to get a sense of the bad things that were being done to the Jews and -- but I still wasn't clear that I was a Jew at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I just thought that these were poor people who were being treated shamelessly, and so it was kind of difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But later on -- oh, maybe about seven or eight or ten years ago, but no more than that, I met somebody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Quite by accident, who had been the daughter of one of the villagers in one of the smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> that we lived in. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And she and her husband had been running a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and distributing leaphlets to their <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> in front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tickets booth</span> on <span class="DLF">42nd Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And, I was reading a French book and that got us into a conversation which finally ended up by telling her where I was from and she said "Oh my goodness, she was from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">When did I live there?" </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Very suspiciously she asked me this and I told her and she looked at me and she said "Oh, were you the Belgtums or the Jews?" </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So which really brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to me the fact that I wasn't the only one that considered myself not a part of this Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Because there were many -- I don't know, there were quite a few maybe 20, 30, Jewish people who were living there, you know, under village arrest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  You were aware that you were Jews but you weren't aware of the double risk?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  Absolutely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I didn't realize that anybody was at a double risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And I was a small child and quite innocent. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">My knowledge of war came from literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And in literature there is no such thing as this. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">At least not the literature that you read when you ate six or seven years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">There are good guys and there are bad guys, and that is basically it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  Let's go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I want you to tell me a little about what you were, your family knew about Hitler or Naziism (ph) before Belgtum ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  I knew nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">My father, I really don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">My father obviously knew everything that my mother did because she would have shared it with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">My mother was a clinical scientist and she said that when I was born, she cried and cried and cried and cried because it was 1933 and she could see what was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So she was very aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And I know that when I was a child there had been many many conversations about immigrating. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And my father kept saying no, we will be okay and my mother kept saying, no we got to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">At one point they -- my mother and I, went to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> (ph) where my maternal grandparents were living and we went to where my maternal grandmother was living. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">You see my maternal erandparents and my maternal erandmother were living and to try to get them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">At one point my maternal grandparents did leave <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> (ph) and they went to visit their son who at this time, that's the man who had gone to live on ___ at one point. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And he was now living in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> with his wife and two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I guess maybe that he didn't even have two children at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Yeah, but anyway they went to visit him and they decided they really wanted to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they didn't feel comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">They felt that maybe they were too old to take on this culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">My mother and father argued with them that a Spanish culture was something very foreign to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">French or <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> culture would be something they would be much more familiar with, at least through their education, etcetera etcetera and tried to convince them to stay in Belgtum. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">They declined this as well and went on back. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And then in 1937 my mother and I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> (ph) and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and tried to get my erandparents to leave, to no avail. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So that is how much my parents knew, a great deal, a great oreat deal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  What do you remember about this when it happened, how things started changing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Well, we didn't stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But how it happened was very sudden, it happened overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">It happened in one or two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> one day and the school teacher told us that they were passing out flowers in a <span class="NPIP">corner</span> and we should take these flowers and take the petals off of them and put them in baskets. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Because, the next day our armys would come on through on their way to fight the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And so we did this to the flowers and a great deal of hooplah and horay horay, we are going to be saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">The next day we were excused from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And, my parents <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was on a main <span class="DLF">road</span> which was a two-lane <span class="DLF">highway</span> but was still a main <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And, the troops came marching down the main <span class="DLF">road</span> where everybody who lived anywhere near was out on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And people had bread and they had cheese and they had wine and lots and lots and lots of wine which they gave to the soldiers wishing them well and wishing them luck and children would throw petals on the soldiers marching by. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It was very glorious and very very glorious and three days later they came back or four days later or something, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">The war was won, the Germans had walked all over them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  How was the mood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  Well, they went from total elation to total defeat, I mean not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">There is a very very powerful poem written by -- I believe it 1s . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">It just basically sets the tone for this you know, it says: The month of May was the month of roses and the month of lilies, and the month of June had a dagger in its heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Were the people in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> trying to deal with this in any certain way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  I don't think -- I may be wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But I really don't think, apart from the political groups, that people in <span class="REGION">Northern France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and maybe more <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> than that to, were really so aware of the Nazis as being different from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Don't forget that the French and the Germans had these conflicts for centuries. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And the most recent one was in 1914 and it was a question of land grabbing and wanting more power and this had already been done through the Eastern Army that was what <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And that's what parts of were all about and so I think, although I have no reason to say that, other than what I have read since. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">But people were probably more conscious with the fact that this was another devastating war that was going to take place. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But, I don't think that anybody thought of it as strictly political war or even any political overtones. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I think that came quite a bit later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  Now, while you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , did you come in contact with German troops?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  No, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">While I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and when my father went to work one day, oh -- within a week or so of the occupation and his boss said to him that he felt that my dad should take his family and leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">That he wasn't a Belotum number one, and that he was a Jew, number two, and that he was at great, great risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So he gave my father what amounted to six month salary and he said "God Bless You," and when he gave my dad a letter of introduction to his sister factoryin___ and we left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  Let me just ask you one question while we are on that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  So even the short time and we are talking a few weeks --
ANSWER:  No, we are talking -- yeah maybe two.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Were your activities restricted?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  Was there any sense --
ANSWER:  No that is what I was going to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Yes, things changed terribly from the day of the petal throwing to the day that we left which was somewhere between seven and ten days later. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I mean we ate talking about a very short period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">What happened 1s that the routine my life had followed until that day became nonexistent. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Nobody seemed to care whether I was fed or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I had a maid, my parents had a maid who was usually about 17 years old or so that took care of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So she was mote ot less like a mother's helper more than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Anyway, this young girl had gotten quite sick with and she had gone to live with her parents and I think she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I didn't know very well what had happened to her but I know she was a nurse so she wasn't taking care of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So for the first time there was nobody but my mom to take care of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">My parents and my neighbors were crouched over a radio most of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Certainly in the evening from five or six o'clock on there was this crowd of people a holding on to this radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I could go on and do whatever I wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I could go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> whenever I wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I remember staying out and watching it getting dark and I've never seen it get dark <span class="NPIP">outside</span> before. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I continued to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , nobody at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> seemed to care about what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">It was a terrific change for several days and after that we left and we went up and took my mothers <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and I can't remember if we took my dad's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> as well, I think we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And we took a suitcase and we took my mothers -- my mother had an old battered fur coat which her mother had maybe given her ten years before or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">It was pretty battered up and we took that. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And so we were traveling very light and we were using the fur coat pretty much as a blanket or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> or whatever we needed to use it for. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And, we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">During the ___ out of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and I guess the ____ also rode into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and ___ I was bringing movies to sort of back up some of my stories as the French movie which was made oh, maybe in the 1940s or early 1950s called "Forbidden Games" I don't know if you're familiar with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Anyway, it is a magnificent movie but one of the things that it shows it is about a girl whose parents are in one of these <span class="DLF">lines</span> and she escapes dying after she runs after her little dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">But it shows very, very clearly this thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people in a <span class="DLF">line</span> just moving down a <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And some of them are on foot and some of them are on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> and of course some of them ate in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">But of course there is no gasoline as the ones in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> go so far. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And the, the ones in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> get abandoned and the <span class="DLF">streets</span> the <span class="DLF">roads</span> are__ with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And maybe every two or three minutes begins and so people dodge for cover and they dive into the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> and the sides of the <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And sometimes the people get up and sometimes they don't because a certain amount of are successful and people are just down dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">So it is just an unbelievable sight you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And this went on for a long time, it went on for about two days, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  Who were all these people ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  People, people. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Belgium citizens, ;
QUESTION:  Where were they going?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  They were going away from trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">They were being bombed, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And you know the Germans had occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  Where were they going ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  To the South, there was no other way to go because on the one <span class="NPIP">side</span> was the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> and on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So they all had to go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  Would you find this ot somewhat an adventure this
ANSWER:  I don't remember how I found it at first. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Eventually I found it terrifying at first. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I don't think that I was terribly frightened, I had my parents with me and I felt very comfortable and comforting when my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">They were good parents and I was a good child. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">We all got along very well you know, so I trusted them. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And pleasantly I guess I would not have to be so terrified as other people might be. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">But then something really bad happened and I got to a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> where my dad decided that he just couldn't take it with the three of us across so what he said he would put me behind this tiny little <span class="DLF">wall</span> , it's a kind of open wall shelter, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And he would leave me behind this <span class="DLF">wall</span> and take my mom. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I think what had happened is that we had lost one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , I think that it must have been that. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And so he decided that he was going to take my mom and bring her somewhere down south and come back get me and bring me back there. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And at that point, I got terrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Because that is where the started and I had to hide behind this <span class="DLF">wall</span> that is probably no higher than this. (</span><span class="sentence" id="196">indicating) It was just panics then. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">But my dad did come back and he said that my mom was okay and he picked me up and brought me to where they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So we wandered on and on and on and on and eventually we got to . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And that must have taken us two, three days, not that long we were all good walkers. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Another thing that I would really have to say at this point is really that physically very good shape my father and my mother were bicycling for years and years, they were great walkers as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">They lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> and not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So I think that they had it over the people that came from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">But other people that lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> were just as well off as who lived in that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So anyway we arrived at . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And my father went to present himself at the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where they kind of laughed at him and said "Gees we would love to take you, but the Germans had just taken us over. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">So I don't think that you would feel very happy here." </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So that was one of our hopes gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So by that point we lived pretty much by my parents wits. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And we went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LaMoss</span> (ph) to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> which of course, was occupied at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">But my Argentineans (ph) uncles sister in law lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> so we went and lived with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">We went and stayed there maybe about a month and a half and it was very, very strange because people were wearing gas masks and all I remember Parts is playing on the , which was . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And the gas masks that people were wearing were very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">It was kind of a unpleasant time. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , we went to this --

<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  It's difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">My mother was pretty much the brains behind our organization of that particular trip and she said that we had to leave, so we went on to the southwest. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And we got to and along with a great, great many people, we tried to cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> a couple of <span class="DLF">bridges</span> and we got to one of the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> was already overfilled with people and the Germans were still , they were bombing badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And we barely did not make it to the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">But then we finally did. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And we pushed and we shoved and we pushed and we shoved and we moved to the other side of the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And we pushed and we shoved and we got off the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> and the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So I guess that was a very scaty experience that was in my life, because then we are really talking about maybe a minute, maybe less. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">The difference between life or death you know just so visible and just so terrifying to see all these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And then we left and then my mother decided that we had to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to go to___, and she managed to get us on the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> leaving through free <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> from north to south. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">There wasn't an requisition by the Germany army. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I don't know how she did but I can still remember her screaming "my child must get on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="242">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was just and my mother had a lot of . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">She got her child on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and then she said "that no child can ride on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> without its father." </span><span class="sentence" id="244">So she got my father on and then she said something about we can't travel without a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and then she finally got on. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So the four of us once again we on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">We went for quite awhile and then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was stopped and everybody had to get off but we didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So we never made it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Though, we were to <span class="REGION">Central France</span> then we went on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LaRuse</span> (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">QUESTION:  ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">We got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LaRuse</span> (ph) which is, as I say, was a total mad <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And you know how <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French towns</span> are with the squares in the middle, every <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> on that square was filled with notes. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">You know family so and so looking for so and so and looking for so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But in 19-- maybe it was 1983, '82, something like that, I was stuck at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> because of a huge snow that developed in the North, that was getting back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And I was stuck there like for a day and a half, and turned out I was sitting next to a French family there talking away in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And my father and I had just gone through a part of his history and I was writing it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And he had just told me about his episode in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LaRuse(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="258">You know how everybody was blah, blah, blah. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So these French people were there and I asked if they were about my age or a little bit older. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Actually maybe ten years older than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And they were at about the right age to remember everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And I said to one of them after we made friends, and where were you in June of 1940? </span><span class="sentence" id="263">He said "Madam, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LaRuse</span> (ph) like everybody else." </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And he described to me the scene exactly as I have described to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So that's -- I found that very interesting, indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  When you were traveling, did you have food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  Where did we stay? </span><span class="sentence" id="268">We always stayed with somebody, somebody always put us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I mean we were -- I think by this time <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> has sort of polarized itself, you know, pretty much. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">The poor Germans and the Germans and the for the most part were communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And they tended to be for the country people. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And not necessarily everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">But that was still at the very beginning of the war, don't forget this was 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So people were still not thinking of it so much as the Nazi party versus other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">As they were still thinking in the terms of 1930s when the Spanish Civil War -- as a war of where the classes sort of got mixed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">You know, and the French Communist Party were pretty strong in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and my parents being Russian of course works as a very very big plus. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And they're speaking French as well was as equally a plus so they had it on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So we always had somebody to stay with and we had money. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">We had money but it wasn't worth very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">But we still had all this money that my father's boss had given him. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Then we got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LaRuse</span> (ph) and then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LaRuse</span> (ph) we found my cousins who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> who were Jewish cousins, who had made it down there with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Two families, one of them with one child and a grandmother and the other one with two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So there were eight people in one cat who had their way down to Belgtum.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  By putting their note up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">QUESTION:  On the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">ANSWER:  And so had they. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">People find each other like that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">It's the same way they found themselves after the war was over in all <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">They put up notes and advertised in newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">People just combed those lists, you know, and if you knew somebody that was looking for somebody, you found the name and you pass it on. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">When people are determined, it's not very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">All you have to do is just comb the lists. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So anyway, we stayed with a very nice family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LaRuse</span> (ph) the man had been I guess he had a place that done weddings and receptions and what not, so there were <span class="DLF">grounds</span> -- very nice <span class="DLF">grounds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And little gazebos and a very, very lovely large <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> and <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> and what have. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And most of his family was there and some of his friends were there and we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And after that I have no idea why we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">But I know that my parents and he just got along just famously and he had a nephew who was 15 who's my life and other than that it was a really nice <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Oh there were some and other nice things in <span class="INT_SPACE">cages</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">We had enough to eat there, it was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So we stayed there for a while and the Germans took us and put us in a series of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> where we were under -- well, one <span class="NPIP">place</span> we were under a village arrest and eventually we were under house arrest, but that comes later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">QUESTION:  This was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">QUESTION:  ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">ANSWER:  Well, this wasn't free <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> for very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">It was free <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> when we first got there and then after a while, it wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So then the Germans took us and we were on a list and then we went where we were told to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">QUESTION:  Were you on a list because you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Well, I still didn't know that I was considered Jewish, I just thought that I've been captured by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">QUESTION:  ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER:  With passports and what not, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">They didn't have Belgtum passports my parents hadn't been in Belgtum long enough to become Belgium citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I think they were lacking two ot something. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Which happened to change most of our life. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Anyway, my father as I said, I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Disrabia</span> (ph) and he done his military service in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Disrabia</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="320"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Disrabia</span> (ph) changed back and forth from 1914 to 1940 between <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And in 1940, I was given over to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322"><span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> was part of the axis, so therefore I thought it was part of his military service under an allied <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> or an unallied <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Which caused a great deal of problems to the Germans who were very, very rule bound as we all know. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And, he didn't know what to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So they simply put us under house arrest and they sent out for more instructions. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">This was -- I skipped over one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that we were in all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">That 1s the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I lived -- the woman I told you about earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Anyway, we are in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called which was outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LaRuse</span> (ph) and that is where the Germans had problems with my identification, my parents had classification and they put us under house arrest. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And we would leave at night and we would go stay in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , mostly in <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> and then we would come back in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Anyway, one night my parents had organized a group of maybe about 17 people or so -- all Jews, and with children unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">We left one night to cross the to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and because the shepherds in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> were very, very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">They kind of considered everybody to be part of . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And which we certainly weren't. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">These three salted the milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">They salted the milk so it wouldn't go sour and they welcomed people to use their <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Well they weren't really <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> they were more like stone . [</span><span class="sentence" id="337">mean great big stones. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">We arrived in one of those and settled in and children cried and screamed because of the salt in the milk and they were hungry and tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So my father put it in cold water down stream but he didn't -- the Germans running an expedition found the milk and us and brought us back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Of the 17 people that were there, 14 of them were sent immediately to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">QUESTION:  ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  Well , 1 don't know, they were just sent. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And they didn't know what to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So the next time --
QUESTION:  How come you didn't go with the other 14?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">ANSWER:  Because they didn't know what to do with my father's papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">My father had done his military service for the route. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So he now has the right and they didn't know what to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">So if he had been German and had done his military service, there would be no problem that was coveted. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">So, it is nice not to be covered. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">So anyway, we were put under strict house arrest except me, I still had the freedom to go around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I still don't know why I did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">It was a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , I don't think there was a 150 people in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">We left again, this time we left the two grown men, two brothers and we crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and arrived in . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">lL was kind of terrified that we were caught by soldiers on the way up but they were French soldiers so they let us go. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I think my father gave them some gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">We also had a guide, my father said that he knew the guy that was going to kill us or try to kill us because that is what a lot of the cuides did. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">They killed the people for gold or whatever they had and went out and got more. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">My father said that he knew that he had to stay up all night and watch the guide and if the guide was going to make a move, my father had to make his move first. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And he said that he really didn't know if he was going to be able to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">You know kill in cold blood like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">But he said that the guy just gave up after a while and disappeared, he just ran off. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">So then there was just the five of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">QUESTION:  ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">ANSWER:  And he had a very, very Jewish last name -- I forgotten what it is anymore, a very nice man. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">So we arrived in and I remember that my father -- my father always liked his title-- you know he had his PhD and always calls himself doctor so and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">How wonderful a doctor, we have a very sick young person so my father instead of saying well, I'm not really a doctor said ""Hum, okay I'll try." </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So I remember him performing some sort of a very minute operation on this patient who had been through a whole thing -- I don't know if it was a very bad splinter or something but anyway something of no big consequence but he was able to deal with that very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And we spent the night there and then the next day we went on -- or the next night we went on to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and in order to cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> between and <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> to go over some treacherous . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And a <span class="DLF">path</span> that ran between a very, very steep on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> -- at least it seemed very steep to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And I forgot what holds them open. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">The body of water on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and dogs were howling and the guard dogs that was really scary too. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">So I remember the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> and this first incident that I told you about my dad, leaving me in this little walk was one of the most scariest things that had happened to me during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And they are all very, very physical things, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Anyway, we made it through the <span class="DLF">border</span> and we got <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">on a train</span> and we headed out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barcelona</span> (ph) and we went to a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> that had been given to us as a safe <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which it wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And the next morning at about six in the morning we -- the police came by picked us up and took us to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">But that was okay because even though we didn't know it at the time, our troubles and perils were really over. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">That by now this was 1942 or the end of 1942 and nobody was ever going to try to kill us again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">QUESTION:  You felt thatr
ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">But I know that now. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">So we were fitted into a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> which was the perfect <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and so kind of like a <span class="BUILDING">precinct jail</span> and all kinds of people were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And we stayed there for about five or six days.</span></p>

QUESTION:  ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">ANSWER:  No, not at this level of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And of this level of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , of course, we were sorted and put into other <span class="BUILDING">jails</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">The women went off to the <span class="BUILDING">women’s jails</span> and the men went off to the <span class="BUILDING">men’s jails</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Now the <span class="BUILDING">men’s jails</span> was just more of the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">It had political prisoners, it had political prisoners that were left over from the Spanish Civil War. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">It had criminals, it had big time criminals, it had small time political prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And those <span class="BUILDING">jails</span> was the <span class="BUILDING">men’s jail</span> which was the main <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barcelona</span> (ph) which also was filled to capacity. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Anyway, I am trying to remember exactly what -- I went to the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> a number of times so I'm trying to remember what it looked like. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">It had three sides with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> of a stone <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> built inside to the side of the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> and the <span class="DLF">door</span> or whatever and I think that in my father's <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> there was nine men with a place for three men to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">So they took turns, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And my dad tells me that one of the men who was a political -- I'm sorry who was a political man, a wonderful, wonderful story teller. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And I know that one of the other men was a political prisoner who -- a Jew, a French Jew who joined the French underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">He's a psychiatrist who been caught and sent to which was the terrible <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And he had been taken out of Miranda (ph) and put into this <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Eventually he got put back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miranda</span> (ph) and stayed there until the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">At which point my parents found him quite accidentally in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> (ph) and he came to stay with us for a couple of months. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And he was still practicing psychiatry, he was almost ninety years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Years ago, child psychiatry at that. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Obviously, something is wrong somewhere there, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Well, I don't think should be practicing child psychiatry -- anyway, there was this highway man, and this psychiatrist and my father with a PhD in chemistry and I'm sure that there were some ordinary and I mean interesting criminals there as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And I know that there was one Spanish Jew, because my father kept in touch with him for many, many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">He was a middle class person. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">So -- well, the <span class="BUILDING">women’s jail</span> was far less interesting in the people that were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">There was the great majority of them were petty thieves and prostitutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And as I say that <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> was in uncommon because the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> -- the <span class="BUILDING">women’s jail</span> had been filled. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And that is where my mother stayed and I stayed with my mom for a very short period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">No I didn't, I didn't stay with her at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I was in a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">precinct jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">When these people came by their name was Hartock (ph) and they had been given my name by the joint. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And they had no children and they wanted to take care of me and look after me. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">They wanted to take care of me and they were a Swiss-German family, and they had a dog and they were very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">They loved their dog and like I say, they had no children. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And, I had just been through several years with no food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and I was very perturbed by that situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I was very perturbed by the fact that they were Germans and I tried to set fire to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And I drowned their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I tried to kill the dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I was just doing the best after the war you have to understand, I mean we had things so good after all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And they were wonderful, they put up with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">They weren't very understanding because they put me in a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> and they put me in a Swiss-Deutsch school. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">You know, instead of letting me go to the <span class="BUILDING">local school</span> and learn some Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">So things did not go too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">I stayed with them for two or three months until my parents got out of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and my mother got out of <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  Did you stick with your parents most of the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  Ah-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Sure, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">You know if I had any brothers or sisters, I don't know if we would have made it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">It was so much easier because they shuffled me around from one parent to the other one and they were both parents together. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And so I always had somebody protecting me. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And they only had one person to take care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">But with brothers and sisters, I don't know if we would have been able to manage it. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Because I have four children myself and I think about how difficult it was to travel or to go anywhere with them when they were small. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And I just don't know how they could have done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Anyway, the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that I remember -- well, you asked me at one point how people helped us and how we lived in terms of food and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I remember that we went to another small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we lived for maybe two months or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I don't even remember the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> -- if it would come to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Just and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> is where it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And from now on, I never lived in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , except for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deruse</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="469">We only lived in small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And I already told you about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deruse</span> (ph) and finding our way through and finding our relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And the first time the Germans found us, they sent us to . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">That was the first time that we were registered.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  Ah, those relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Those relatives most ingeniously, I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I call one of them, his name is . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I call him my uncle, he's not of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">He is my father's second cousin who married my fathers first cousin, who was his second cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And who presently lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and I call him my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">It has always been much easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Most ingeniously, he said to me one day, oh Helene I knew it you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I said to your dad, we have money, we will get out of it somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">You have no money, but you have brains you'll get out of it somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">So they did, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Laruse</span> (ph) they vanished with their money to and then from to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And they spent the rest of the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> with families. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I think the other family stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> throughout the war and eventually went to <span class="COUNTRY">Mexico</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">That families business has been tan, tanning furs, or tannery. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And all business had been fur brokering and after the war and his family went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , which is where I ended up. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">But that is the end of this story.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="499">QUESTION:  ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">ANSWER:  Just like that, somebody's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">You asked how people took care of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">People took care of you because there was this very very strong feeling about the pro and the cons the good euys and the bad guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">People took care of whoever happened to go by. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">They had such a strong feeling of -- with having my parents being involved with at one point. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">You know, and they started transporting food and stuff, I mean but anyway, a little later that comes in. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Anyway, I remember these people in whose <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we were supplying us with food and drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And I remember that I fell asleep and I was, according to my parents very very drunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And they put me to sleep and the next day somehow were found. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Somehow clothing was found, I remember the clothing was found because it was not clothing that I could identify. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And then I have a picture of me wearing this clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">We set up with a little boy who was also from a Jewish family, who was my great friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And he was only about four- five years old, maybe three- four years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Anyway, we stayed there a couple of months and I remember this was the first time when I really remember my dad taking me out for walks and becoming the great philosopher, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">We saw a <span class="DLF">field</span> of daffodils one time; words could not have been any prettier. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">It was in an <span class="DLF">oak field</span> tons and tons and tons and tons of oak and mistletoe growing from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">oaks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And just tons and tons and tons and tons of daffodils. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Oh gosh, this must have been 1941 right, because of the springtime. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And it was so beautiful, I remember my father telling me that marriage was a terrible institution. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And he was very, very lucky because he had found himself a very nice wife who had not conned things out of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Not just the fact that she was his wife but, the only way to live is for two people who adored each other to live with each other, without the unsacred of marriage and on and on and on. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">In his very procommunist fashion we went on and started talking to me about politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">About how the communist regime was the only thing that made any sense, you know and blah, blah, blah. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And I remember being very struck by how much sense this made daffodils. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">So then -- those are the sort of memories that I have about that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Anyway then we were sent from ___—sto___—ito___ and I think we were transported to ____1f I remember correctly by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Just as I told you there were no more <span class="DLF">railroads</span> because they were all taken over by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And they were used for military transport to people outside <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">QUESTION:  The Germans were ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">QUESTION:  Did you know why, was there any reason?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">ANSWER:  Because we were on the list of Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">QUESTION:  So they were some <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">ANSWER:  They put everybody that they could into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Most the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> that they put people in were either too full or too far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">So what they did, and I think a lot of people don't realize that, is they invented <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And the <span class="NPIP">places</span> , the two <span class="NPIP">places</span> they sent us afterwards, I forget, was an invented <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">They didn't have the horror of a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Plus there are these three levels of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">There were the ones that we never experienced were the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Then there were the ones that I never experienced which was the and I guess to some degree the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> were like that too. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">They weren't <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> because you weren't killed there, but you died there. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">You died of starvation and mostly you died of disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Because you can deal with starvation to some extent, better than to deal with disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And then there was the third kind which were like the ones that we were in. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Where if you could manage somehow to get a little bit of freedom and to deal with the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , you manage to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And then you were put under village arrest sometimes and house arrest other times. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">If you were put under village arrest, that was really good. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">If you were put under house arrest, that was pretty bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Now since most of the people found their way to these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> -- for Eastern European Jews, who had moved to the South of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> warmed there way, but still didn't speak French -- we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">We were accepted by everybody, everywhere that we went as being French speakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I told you about that woman that I met who asked me, was I for Jews or Belgians. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">We were for Belgians, we were one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And so it was very different and I could go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and make friends with my teachers and make friends with my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> mates. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">We read the books and we get benefits of going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">So my life was normal and then just totally disrupted. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Was totally different, but at least there was a base, a connection in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I never felt unconnected.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">QUESTION:  you talk about being a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , I'm trying to understand about how it was set up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">ANSWER:  It wasn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">QUESTION:  Also, so I don't interrupt you again, what's the difference for you between <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and village arrest?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="561">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">House arrest under which I found myself in for a very short time, you had to stay in your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="563">You were really -- and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> were very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">We are talking about a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> here where a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> is maybe a 150 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">I mean 500 people is a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and a 150 is pretty normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">You're talking about a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where -- which is very, very primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I mean some people have privies and not have to go out and use the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="568">You're talking about people where some people have and some people have to stand behind the plow themselves plowing the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="569">You know when we get into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that I went to in 1953, I was just 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And they had just put in running water the year before and they were talking about now electricity. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And you're talking about a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> -- I mean it was 15 kilometers on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , the fourth largest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">You're talking about very, very primitive stuff here. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">So when your under house arrest in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like that, you're going to go crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">That is like being in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And the people who would oversee this house arrest were Germans because there were German patrols, very few of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Which, had been installed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I keep saying <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> is such a strange word to use in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but I always mean <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> when I say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">These people were the ones that were supervising us, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And I don't know what the penalty was for breaking the law, but I imagine that it would be very severe. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Like instant removal to a real <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Now I say here <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> but there weren't <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , they were holding places. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">That is what they were, holding <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">QUESTION:  How many people were in these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">holding tanks</span> ?</span></p>

ANSWER:  We could not move out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Now eventually we left and we tried to escape but when we came back we were put under house arrest. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And that was very very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">When we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> arrest my father went out and -- you see my father was brough up on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> when he was a child and he's very clever with things and he knows how to make things grow and to ____ with machinery and make it do whatever he wants it to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">He's just one of these people that just seems to have a way with everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And so he became friends with some of the farmers and he would work for them, of course it was for free. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">But it was never for free they would give him a pregnant rabbit, a duck with some eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Though we always had things, and food and at one point we had these neighbors who lived -- I guess that is when we lived in . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">We had these neighbors who were very Jewish, I mean the man was a chauffer, they were very religious and they had a grandmother who really couldn't ____. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">So my father decided to build her a little privy (ph) which she put in the little <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> in the back, which she had to share with two goblins. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Turkey goblins, which my father had gotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Again from some farmers which and we had gotten a who we called Hecter (ph), I guess we called him Adolf, not Hecter (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And one day there was this wonderful feast and usually when they killed a pig, you know, the slaughtered a pig, the children from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> when the pig was slaughtered the kids would be allowed to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but I wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And I remember just hearing that pig just squealing and I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I had to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Anyway, eventually I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And it was wonderful, people would recite poetry and people would get up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and let go and sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">You know, and there was a lot of wine flowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">There wasn't food, because we didn't have food because the Germans took much of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">But we did manage to secrete enough of the pig, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And then once in a while we'd kill a goose or something and render its fat and put the goose into the fat, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And you would have meat to eat along with the goose fat. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">You could spread on whatever, potatoes or whatever vegetable that you had. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">So that is how we lived, we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I played with the kids and I'd play with them after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and my parents talked to me and I read a lot of books and it was very disruptive, but I don't remember the bad things, I just refuse to remember the bad things. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">But I do that as a adult. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I have a very very hard time remembering bad things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">QUESTION:  And wherever you went, it seems the people that lived in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> were all very well ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="690">QUESTION:  Do you know why your parents decided that <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> was going __
ANSWER:  I have absolutely no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Thinking about it, I would think that my parents would have thought that that was one step closer to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and it might have been easier to deal with the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> that were already half way on than to have to start from the bottom and cross over. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">More difficult <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="705">QUESTION:  Were there -- in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> that you were in under village arrest, were all the refugees Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">ANSWER:  As far as I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">As far as I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And the reason that I think so is because they all spoke a different language. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">They all spoke either Yiddish or German or Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And, I only spoke French and Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">So I couldn't understand them at all.</span></p>
