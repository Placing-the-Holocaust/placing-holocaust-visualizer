<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Carl, would you tell us your full name, and when you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I was born, of course, uh...
QUESTION:  Start with your name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  My name 1s Carl--C-A-R-L--H. Kniiemann--K-N-E-U-E-M-A-N-N. Kntiemann. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">And I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bydgoszcz</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Actually, the Germans called it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bromberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">A very difficult name to spell, so...
QUESTION:  In what year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  Uh, 1922, 15th of November. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And, of course, uh I lived there until 1932. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And in November, we left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because my father was German citizen and businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">We had a small <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> --bakery machinery and stuff like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Uh, so...
QUESTION:  What was it like growing up? </span><span class="sentence" id="11">You can look at me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , actually, compared with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , it was a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> expecting a <span class="NPIP">paradise</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My parents had told me that it would be like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">But it turned out that life in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was like living in a democracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">There was strike, there was economic hardship; and so as a child I was very much aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Most of my friends were Polish boys from the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and so...And uh because there was strife between the German ethnic minority and the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">The usual fare was, you know, when we had children's dispute or so, my friends came up to me and said, "Tomorrow!" </span><span class="sentence" id="20">It meant actually they were mad at me; but they never came with a knife and cut my throat. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I didn't expect them to either, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">They didn't expect to do that either. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">So I got really right thrown into, you know, uh ethnic problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And you get used to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And uh you are not missing it necessarily, but you are not getting upset about it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">My mother is of Hungarian, Polish, and German descent, all three. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">The family came from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> originally via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And Frederick the Great took these Salzburg Germans into <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">That's where my mother landed. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And the family mixed with Polish uh persons, and so she is a completely relaxed person. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My mother is Just...1s not getting upset about anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">But already as a child I knew when a problem came up, she stepped right in and helped solving it. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">She never turned her back. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">My father same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I mean, I lived...I had the luck to be guided by the example of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So it dropped out of me to you know, I mean any strife and so on, I am not necessarily personal mistakes solving problems, those problems, but sometimes it better to increase the problem and make it so bad that people see it once what a foolish thing it was, and they stop it. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So I was a happy child. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">My father was a hunter. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">He went fishing. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">He was socially quite active. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We had parties our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Being a businessman in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> meant actually that you had your clients invite at least once or twice a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Once at least for a big hunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Uh, that's why my father really kept the hunting ground to have a party opportunity to reward his customers. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">My father also became honorary consul of the German Weimar Republic, so as a businessman...And he served in this function, I think, until '29 or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And, of course, he knew about the Nazi and didn't like anything of their stuff whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Because of the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> things were discussed and the officers of the foreign service, they already indicated that Hitler will take over very soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So the message of doom, at least for my father, was quite clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">It didn't...1t took one incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">My father was riding by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bydgoszcz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And he, of course, used first class, and as a businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And another person came into his <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> --a German who traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , too--and after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started to move, this man opened his briefcase and took the Nazi Central Newspaper out, [the] Volkischer Beobachter. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">My father, seeing this...he didn't like the type of person anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">He looked like a reserve officer, had the bearing of a military man. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">He saw this, my father really angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">He took his briefcase from out of the rack and told this guy, "I don't want to share my <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> with a man who reads the Nazi paper." </span><span class="sentence" id="57">That's what the kind of person my father was. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Because he addressed the right person. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">This person was actually his replacement. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">You know, he was on a visit to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bydgoszcz</span> to talk to my father how he would take this over, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And later on, a day or two later, he met him. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">This guy came visiting and said, "I am Consul [Bernhard (ph). '" </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And he...Of course, it was an icy meeting; and my father was relieved of his position in a week's time. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">This guy had gone back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and wrote up the incident in the <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> ; and that really fixed my father's future for good. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">My father, of course, didn't need that job at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">It was really uh more bother than reward. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">He ran his business. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But then the recession came and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was very hard hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">My father was German citizen living on a passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So the Poles said, "Mr. Kniiemann, why don't you go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brandenburg</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="71">That is what <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was called in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And we got an order that our visas would not be prolonged, and that we had to leave by the end of 1932 to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">My father could have gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> ; but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , really big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And he had probably better opportunities to get a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">But he was in error. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">He came and he was told, 'No job for you. " </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Because of his remark. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And Hitler was not even in power then. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">But they already had...you know, the Nazis had already moved into strategic positions and already influenced the selection of people who could be hired or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So my father never got a job offer. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">He just unemployed from 1933 to 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  How did you survive financially?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  He was...he was actually a veteran. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">But being a German national, he had actually abdicated his right for pension because "I don't go and collect from my father[land]. " </span><span class="sentence" id="85">That was the attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">An idiot, of course. (</span><span class="sentence" id="87">Laughing) But he... finally, he was terribly sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">He had TB, open TB, and was about to die; so they admitted him to a <span class="BUILDING">veteran's hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And his pension was restored, but on a level about 50% disability. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But he was really 250% disabled, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So he spent uh half a year in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ; was operated several times, of course, to no avail. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">But the acute conditions were removed. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">My mother and my sister and I, we lived in <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which cost as about 80% of our income. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , people didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">They thought we were criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Kicked out from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> for not paying taxes, or stealing something, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I mean, the Germans to me were completely insensitive--even to the needs of their own people in a way, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  Why did they think that you were criminals?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  They thought I had a Polish accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">That is enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">You know, (laughing) people have funny notions. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">If you are Hungarian, you are necessarily a Gypsy or violin player. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Hungarians can play violins very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Most, I guess, don't play violins. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But being of Polish, being...having this title "Polak"...And I, as a child going into <span class="BUILDING">Berlin school</span> , was treated as a Polak. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">My German was really quite good, but not perfect. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I had a Polish accent and also uh didn't have the wealth of words to describe things in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So when this happened, I sit down and really learned German. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And actually better than most Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I really speak even today better German than most Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Definitely!</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  Tell me about your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">You brought some photographs with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Tell me about the birth certificate you have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Here is my Polish birth certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">This is a major obstacle in my whole life. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">When people ask me, "What are you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I say "Polish. " </span><span class="sentence" id="120">They say, 'No, your German gives you away. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">You are German." </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And, of course, here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> I am now American citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Often people say, "But you have an accent." </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Then I say, "Yes, I was born Polish. " </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And they say, "No, you have a German accent." </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I say, "Unfortunately, I suffered from being born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Because I had to immigrate here. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">The quota was full, and no entry for me in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">For long years, you know, I... So you get hit, no matter what you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">If you are different, you get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And I learned that in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , even when I was born, the kids came and met this...It was not meant in a bad way, (cough) it was just the type of reaction they had when they saw something who was different from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And it's everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  You have other things as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">What is that you have now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  This is actually my German maturation diploma, which entitles me to go to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  You want water?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So this took also some doing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I had avoided joining Nazi Youth Organization and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I had a terrible time to fake myself through to be admitted here and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Of course, I had a very good Jewish doctor who gave me attestations I was the sickest kid on the <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So they got easy on me, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And uh besides, legal speaking, my age was a little bit too advanced to force me in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">The law actually uh spared those born before 1924. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So I was born '22, and didn't encounter much trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">But the authorities, when I applied going to...to--let's say, <span class="BUILDING">college</span> --would call, they said, "You are not member of any Nazional Socialistice (ph) organization, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Only we...are only interested in people who become leaders here." (</span><span class="sentence" id="148">Laughter) I said, "I am not very much interested being a leader, anyway." (</span><span class="sentence" id="149">Laughter)
QUESTION:  Show me what else. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">You have some photographs of you growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Now these would be in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> as a young child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Here, that's the height of my career! (</span><span class="sentence" id="154">Laughter) I always tried to climb up that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="155">Laughing) And finally, my father helped me and took a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I was 2-1/2 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So this was taken in 1924. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">This was my highest point in my career. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I was really proud of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">You can see the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">branches</span> all debogged because I always tried again and again to climb up. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">You see, I'm restless. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">| am a go-getter. (</span><span class="sentence" id="163">Laughing) Actually to maybe familiarize you, my father immigrated, not immigrated, this <span class="REGION">area</span> was German under the Kaiserreich and the were interested in getting Germans in that because they wanted to, uh, discourage Poles to live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So people wanted to expand, get a new business. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">My uncle had done so. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">He was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> in <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And my father went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> --or at that time it was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> --to beat...to learn the trade of sales representative in my uncle's firm. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">So, where they came from. . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">My father was the 24th child, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">The woman had two husbands. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Of course, in succession, not at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Although one could think...But there was no child after him. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">That was the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="174">Laughing) But the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where my family comes from was built in 1210, and is still standing--miraculously--in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eisenberg</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poleberg</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And I have just met people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eisenach</span> , and they say, "Oh, my uncle is a neighbor of the Kntiemann family, and they lived next to this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . " </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Was taken by my father, I think, in 1923 or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And these are my grandparents sitting in front. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">My grandfather was uh miner. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">There were these many children. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">One could only operate the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , so the others naturally went into the...under...into the <span class="DLF">mines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">My grandfather worked there 73 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And on the day of his retirement, he collapsed and was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Real great thing to have a pension waiting for you. (</span><span class="sentence" id="184">Laughing) And they kept it all, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And another distinction my family had, my father was a veteran in the first World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Lung shrapnel hit him. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">My grandfather--a veteran of 1971'--the same...the same uh (laughing) injury in the <span class="REGION">Prussian front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">The French were...My grandfather, the same injury. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">In the war with <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span> /<span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . “</span><span class="sentence" id="190">So same...almost the identical. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I am first one without an injury. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I think I learned a lesson from the past, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">My father said, "If you go into this war, and you get injured, you come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I beat you up like you never have been." (</span><span class="sentence" id="194">Laughing) First thing was, of course, he didn't want his son to stand for this Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">He considered Hitler simple gangster. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Nothing else, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">He took everything and gave nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  Tell me about...Tell me...You have one more picture there I want to show, about a school woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And I would like you to talk about your father. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Yeah, that one. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Tell me about that and the photographs. ' </span><span class="sentence" id="202">NB: 1871. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">This would have been during the Franco-Prussian War. * </span><span class="sentence" id="204">1866.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  This is...my schooling started in a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I think this was a second year in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">It was a normal...
QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Was a normal <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Was still. . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">it was 1934 when I entered this. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I was a little late. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I was a year older, or two years older, than the rest of my...Because of my transfer from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , I had only Polish as a foreign language. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And not French or Latin, or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So I had to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Also, my German was not that great. (</span><span class="sentence" id="217">Pause) They found. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And uh so this teacher was a Doctor |[Dunmeyer (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="219">A very strange occurrence. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">He was a hunchback. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And, of course, like anyone in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who was considered a weakling of normal--hunchback, cross-eyed, flat feet--that was an unwanted citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And this man, because of his...I think, of his constants endurance of being looked at as a defective person was (sobbing) enormously kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">A person who... (sobbing)
QUESTION:  Take a minute.</span></p>

There was no <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to be had. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">The mother didn't like this marriage at all, so he moved into my section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="857">We lived, because we couldn't pay, in the worst section-- prostitution, crime, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> were about half of what they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="859">They couldn't find anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">So he rented a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> --which was never heard of, I don't think even here. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And he made it sort of a <span class="BUILDING">artist studio</span> , and really free for all. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">Everyone could come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And he had connections to the <span class="BUILDING">black markets</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="864">Very easy to serve. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">They stopped, carry in, out; you know, you don't have to go four flights up or down. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And his wife, being a very volumptuous woman...I mean, even the anti-Nazis knew there was something to look at, at least, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">And they were just host to everybody, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And they established really a meeting point for people who were anti-Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">They had all these American records, British records. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Bertold Brecht was played. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Anything which was forbidden by the Nazis, that's where you could hear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And over the time, even SS officers came. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">The strangest thing, they were so fed up by this, you know, even SS officers get tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And they came, and they cooperated. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">We got even ideas from them, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">They were completely disillusioned, of course, because they were really prisoners of the system. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And to have a day or two leave and full freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">It was just...they could be human beings, suddenly. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And, of course, then getting false passports for people needed to get out and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And uh was a different world. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">I mean, it existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">Of course, the workers section, they tolerated this. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">They would never have told the authorities, "This bothers me, or this bothers me. " </span><span class="sentence" id="885">They were maybe loud; but that was a noisy laughter here. (</span><span class="sentence" id="886">Laughing) It was anti-Nazi, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">They would have loved to be part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And I tell you what it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="889">This murky little petit bourgeoisie-type, you know--which automatically hated Jews because they were liberal--they were open, they had new values. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">The whole German culture is almost Jewish culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I mean, in culture production--songs, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I mean, there is really, for me, I was neutral Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">Whatever was, I took as being German. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">Not Jewish, or not that: it was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And it is completely hidden in German history books. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">Even a hundred years ago, what the participation of Jews this was. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Since there was no knowledge about what this really was, to load the population into a anti-Jewish mode and make them the strangers.

</span><span class="sentence" id="989">I mean I could buy machine guns, anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">Like here, it's forbidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">But actually Nazis were not that crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">They...I mean you could have weapons, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">My father had hunting weapons, I mean, very dangerous ones, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And, uh, since there were warriors and robbers anyhow, the old government, they didn't take it so seriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Besides, the Nazis really thought that they controlled everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">They had no...they didn't even have a suspicion that there was a segment of the population really going after them. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">They didn't know this. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">I mean there was the West that they contributed...you see that they were the victims of their own philosophy. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">They thought Jews were the typical resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">There was...actually for a Jew, it was very, very difficult to be a fighter because people, officials...you looked Jews, Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">I don't know some Jews I know looked more, they looked more like Siegrfied, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">But they looked for that type you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">I mean everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">In all <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">If they were gypsies, a chicken is stoled, and a gypsy was there a week ago, he did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">There was always a minority which can be easily recognized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">Round up the usual suspect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">Like in the Casablanca film, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">If they didn't find any of them, it was, uh, Jews do it any how. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">But in this case here, these Frenchmen, the ethic French men, they were not trusted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">But they were sent for occupation duty in <span

conveniently got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and bought two big suitcases full of pistols. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">And I repeated it several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">I...you see at that time, the Nazis collected weapons from civilians, mostly weapons man had brought back as souveniers from war crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">And these women were impressed if they would be caught by, for instance, if Russians, if they ever would come, they would be of course raped 15 times, mangled, (laugh) and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">And these Nazi officials stood there and took the weapons 1n, you know, and I stood outside the collection point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">I know even the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , it was <span class="DLF">Horst Wessel Platz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">It was

<p><span class="sentence" id="1098">ANSWER:  We had relatives...my uncle from my mother's side, they lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">Actually, my uncle was Polish officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">And, uh, because of the air raids in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , his being there was almost impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">And also the food shortage and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">So he had rented from friends or relatives a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with a <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">He lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">But, of course, he knew all what was going on, you know, and actually we had two contacts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">I mean it was Goerdeler and the initial plot never came off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">Actually, the plotters were doing this since really 34 and, uh, uh, they never could get agreement from the generals because weapons are needed for a thing like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">And they objected, they had given the oath of office on Hitler and so forth and besides, don't kid yourself, they never make a plot successful. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1108">laugh) Through German history, these Germans are outspoken cowards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">You know they are only form...not some...nothing in them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">They are actually removed from the people, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">It's not a people's army in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">It's the king's army or the Fihrer's army, and that was the biggest problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">And it seemed that this whole thing would never go off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">So my father was at that point not in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">But the...what really brought it off...and that was Johannes Popitz, the Prussian Finance Minister. ’</span><span class="sentence" id="1116">He was head of a sort of semi-conservative people's party before Hitler, and Hitler tried to > From 1925-1929. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Previously advisor to Prussian Interior Ministry, 1914-1919. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">Known as a tax expert, his skills were utilized by the Nazis, although he never joined the party. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">give some unimportant <span class="BUILDING">government offices</span> to non-Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">At least, for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">And he was in the state government, in the State of Prussia--which was reduced to non-functioning, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">He left this government alive, but they had nothing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">Popitz found plenty of time to conspire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">The best thing was, you know, Mrs. Popitz was a Dutch born lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">And you know who caught a fancy on her? </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">Heinrich Himmler! </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">She looked like a real Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">You know, not the most French-like; she looked a little bit more like a milk cow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">She was blonde. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">I mean, a wonderful personality; but Himmler was really interested in her feature, not in personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">And Himmler courted this lady day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">Sent her big boxes, silver boxes, with inscriptions and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">That last until '36 and she died of cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">Himmler was heartbroke. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">And he called the daughter whom I knew--and I knew the other son, Hans Popitz--and he showered this family with attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And, of course, Popitz didn't like this at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">But you can't say no to Himmler, actually, if you want to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">So they accepted the...I later sold it on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , these (laughing) silver boxes, to raise cash for the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">But they...Himmiler still kept an eye on this family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And also the daughter, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">She got gifts, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">And so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">But Popitz--who was the greatest conspirator, you know--he had put this group together and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">And there were almost attempts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">And uh in '44, Popitz got a call from his old friend, Himmler. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">He said, "Johannes, we know everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">We know what you are doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">Don't think that you can operate here without me knowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">But you know what that means: that you and all your conspirators are done with." </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">You know, Himmler was the first defector from the Nazi group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">And this is not known. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">I know it from personal knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">Himmler proposed to Popitz that he would tolerate the plot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">That if successful, the plotters would actually guarantee Himmler and whatever entourage he wanted free exit from German into a neutral <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ; and that he would support any attempt of Hitler's life, as long as it successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">If it 1s not successful, of course, he will abdicate any responsible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And will kill everybody at once out of necessity, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">Because if investigation would have prove that Himmler knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">But, you know, Himmler knew that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was cooked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">I mean, no one else knew it much better than him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">He knew the war is finished, over with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">He knew that he is the major criminal in this game, and his only chance to survive was making a deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">And Popitz met seven times personally with Himmler. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">I know it from Popitz's daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">She was even involved, too, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">It's an awful scheme. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">And very dangerous, of course, for Popitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">Now they agreed on this; and that actually persuaded the military to come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">The chance that they... You see, Popitz worked on this like an eager beaver, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">He was a very honest human man--small, low voiced, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">Goebbels's wrote in his diary that actually vindicated any... any accusation against Popitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">Goebbels wrote, "And this dog Hans Popitz does nothing else but conspiring against us.

(</span><span class="sentence" id="1177">Laughter) And I know Stauffenberg, and so on; and they don't know how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">It happened--in my opinion, of course--they were just not brutal enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">I mean, the French Revolution never happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">I mean, Germans do tt...if they kill people, they cut their heads off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">If it was all sealed, official stamp of approval--like the killing of the Jewish and so--this was all legal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">You know, there were laws permitting it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">So they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">But do it on your own and resist, you never get a German to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">They are like German shepherds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">Only they bite on command, and they are puppies if they are not told to bite. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">But unfortunately, if an outsider comes and bite, they bite you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">I have been bitten by a German shepherd, and a six year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">And I never forget it.

<p><span class="sentence" id="1193">ANSWER:  Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">Strange relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">My mother was, of course, sort of an angel really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">She helped everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">Now when it came to our attention or people came to us or to our friends, they needed immediate help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">Something had to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">A visa had to be gotten to exit <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or somebody was in the KZ and maybe a case could be made to release them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">And there comes in my father's career as a pilot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">As I said before, he was assigned a sergeant who trained him to become a soldier, and, uh, this man was just a sergeant, a professional soldier, and when we moved from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , he worked and had risen to a pretty prominent position as a civil servant in the Veterans Administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">But my father needed to have his pension restored, so this man helped him, but this man had turned into a raving Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">But because as a old comrade so he overlooked the anti-Nazi attitudes of my father, and rehelped him getting his pension and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">They met once. . </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">and then my father discovered that he had married a wife who was born in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> of Mrs. Himmler's wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">And somehow, this man's name, this Veteran's Administration official, had the heroic name Feige which means in English coward. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1207">laugh) This was really a laugh, but as they...He had indicated he wanted to meet with my parents and so on to do the right thing...became sort of acquaintances. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">I think my parents were there socially once. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">And they never came and visited us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">But Feige had moved from the <span class="BUILDING">Veterans Administration</span> once Hitler came in and had become Goebbels assistant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">Of course, it helped to know Mrs. Himmler, that was for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">And, he. . </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">he is also listed in the government publications as being Goebbels Ministerialrat, one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">But he had influence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">But we saw also a possibility to influence Himmler, because Mrs. Feige or this coward's wife, she being the school mate of Mrs. Himmler met with her once a week and both ladies played Bach on a harmonia, on a miserable harmonia, in Feige's <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">And this too...I mean non-political people, they didn't care about one thing or the other...only Bach. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">So Bach was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">And they played for 2, 3 hours on the harmonia, and departed but, of course, like some women do they chat a lot and all this, so we could see that there was a possibility to influence Himmler and when we got really...and I mean we, that means my mother, of course...got cases where nothing would have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">My mother called Mrs. Feige, and said, "I have here a terrible case, you know, once a personal acquaintance of friends of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">Although we know these are difficult ttmes and so on, what can we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">Can you tell Mrs. Feige his name is so and so and so and so.

<p><span class="sentence" id="1252">QUESTION:  You got them out through Mrs. Feige?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1253">ANSWER:  Yah, Mrs. Feige, Mrs. Himmler, and Mr. Himmler finally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">I mean it is unbelievable, I mean, to me, even today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">I mean I wouldn't...you know being a youngster I might have gone into the Reichssicherheitshauptamt, but anyone over 20 would not, because that was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> not to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">For no reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">And that was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">I mean, you see it takes courage and the nerve to stay on your charted course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">You know a dictators really dislike enemies, but they dislike enemies who waver, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">And actually, if you are staying on your course, they are not suspicious because you act like them almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">You see they don't waive, they don't give in on anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">And you appear as if you are ready to get what you came for and then they give you a break. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">I think it's the similarity of format you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1264">QUESTION:  You have brought...you have got pictures here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1265">ANSWER:  Yah, by looking through my pictures, to my astonishment I see a picture which I have never seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">Somehow it, I thought it is a friend and former colleague of my father, Mr. actually Albert Gunter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">He called himself usually Albougie. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1268">ph) It's a picture here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szopot</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Danzig</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> , <span class="BUILDING">seaside resort</span> , with his daughter and wife, a very elegant woman and a very sweet girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">But he was...he was, you know, as you can see, a typical family picture, at a summer vacation at the <span class="REGION">Baltic Sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">Uh, this man had worked tn my uncle's <span class="BUILDING">office</span> ...in my uncle's <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> as sales manager trainee, as has my father, who went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">They became friends naturally and when this <span class="REGION">area</span> became Polish again he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and joined a company in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettin</span> , which produced <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bakery ovens</span> , bakery equipment, and that sort of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">My father kept on and off, you know, contacts and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">When we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , he came visiting us, you know, sort of see how we are doing, and I think it was in 35 or so, this picture is 36. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">He came in and I overheard the conversation, and he said, "Carl, Imagine! </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">I got an order for I think it was 50 ovens for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienburg</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">What do you think? </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">Do they expect that many prisoners?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">50. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">These were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> to bake bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">At that time, it was who knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">It looks quite dim if they need that much bread, they probably get so and so many people and so actually, the existence of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">KZ concentration camp</span> was known all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">That is simply not true what Germans say now, in my opinion at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">I knew it the first day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">Why shouldn't intellectual Germans know it the second day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">No, it was better not to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">But this man had some misgivings about this firm, was Kirst und Soehne, from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sttetin</span> , was probably the fifth or so largest producer of ovens and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">And, after awhile, Mr. Gunter came visiting us again and they ordered even more, and he indicated that they are using these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> to not bake bread, but to burn corpses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">He was really shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">I mean if you got news of that kind in Nazi Germany, you were really not much shocked you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">You knew they did everything imaginable, mean to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">But he was shocked, and he slightly felt responsible, I think, that he had lent his hand, maybe in the beginning, of course, not knowing what this was for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">These <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> were regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baking ovens</span> as far as I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">I mean I have seen films...I have seen films actually with the firm's label on the <span class="DLF">door</span> of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> and I don't think they were modified for this new type of application so. . </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">but, of course, knowing it, that its use to it, possibly I mean, actually, I wouldn't have gone through with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">I would have retired or something, but he went to apparently to the very last and, uh...in 44, he called on our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , <span class="DLF">apartment door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">My mother was gone, my father was out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and he talked to me and this man broke completely down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">He said, "What have I done?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">I must tell you I was not a friend to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">You know he was much older and somehow, this man was SO nervous, So super nervous, he said. . </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">what have...and he asked me...I was what...I was 20 years old...and I was so embittered to see a man before me that I said, "Mr. Gunter, the only thing you can do...commit suicide. " </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">It was terrible for me to say it, but I knew everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">Not from him, but from...of course, you knew everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">And for me, having somebody before me, an intelligent German man, having done this did not say no, I mean, he probably could have invented hundreds of reasons...so I was really...maybe it wouldn't have been my style...I said you have nothing else to do but commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">By the way, he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">Not that I have great power of persuasion, but he felt that's the only thing you can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">Things which have been done, you lent your hand, your talent, you knew, at least along the <span class="DLF">line</span> , that you actively supported, for me this was your death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">It would have been my death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">That's why I simply had a very strong commitment not in any way support this system. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">It was my life really because if they kill others, they kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">Nobody has to get killed for political reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">And I knew if I am in it, I kill myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">I don't kill other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">I kill myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">It's everywhere like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">If you see reasons to kill, do it only then when you want to kill yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">That is the crummiest thing you can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">So later on, my mother lived in <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> and low and behold, she met Mrs. Gunter and her, by then, very pretty grownup daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">I mean, she didn't know about this visit, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">I think he never returned to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">We didn't even know that he committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">Only when my mother met her in <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> , she told us.</span></p>
