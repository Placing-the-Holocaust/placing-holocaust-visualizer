QUESTION:  So you had hid all day long?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="965">ANSWER:  Yeah, all day long. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Next night, we went downstairs and we found the kessle where they cooked the.. the potatos for the cows, for the porks. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">We filled ouselves up with potatos and we went upstairs again. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">We stayed there; we were there three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And on the third day - night- day, at night, we heard people talking Polish, talking French and uh..some other languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">We talked to each other, "What the heck is this? </span><span class="sentence" id="971">Who are these people?" </span><span class="sentence" id="972">SO my freind says, "I'm going to see what's going on." </span><span class="sentence" id="973">I said to him, "You crazy!?" </span><span class="sentence" id="974">As he walks out, and you couldn't see but he said in Polish, ‘cause someone was talking in Polish, he says, "What's happening." </span><span class="sentence" id="975">So he says, "You don't know? </span><span class="sentence" id="976">We've been liberated already two days."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="977">QUESTION:  So you found out about the liberation two days later?</span></p>
