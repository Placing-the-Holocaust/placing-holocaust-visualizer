<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  My parents had a little <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And also my dad did some work on the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and uh...beside the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And then great unemployment, uh, came, the Depression; and they had quite a great difficulties in keeping up with the payments for the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And also the cost of living was quite high. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So they had some difficulties, all the result from the First World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Uh, you made mention that your father was in the First World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  Yes, my father was a Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">He was called in the Army, and uh, was three and a half years on the <span class="REGION">Italian front</span> , in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Isonzo</span> .’ </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And there he got some injuries; and also over a half a ' Serbo-Croatian and Slovenian: So_a. </span><span class="sentence" id="34"><span class="ENV_FEATURES">River</span> which runs near the <span class="DLF">border</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> (<span class="COUNTRY">Slovenia</span> ) and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , in the vicinity of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gorizia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monfalcone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Scene of fierce fighting during World War I. million men lost their lives in that part of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Dolomite Mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And when he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> he couldn't get over it, that what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And he discussed this with some of the war comrades. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And also, he asked the priest why this was possible; that in the name of God, they were placing them to kill their fellow, uh, Catholics who were under the same <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and same Pope. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">But he had no answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And then a few years later, they...1n the end...toward the end of the '20's, some Kolporteuren [Ger: door-to-door book salesmen] or missionaries of the Bible students came around. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And they showed him from the Bible that true Christians would not take part in such a war, that they do believe in the word of Jesus that everyone who takes the sword will die by the sword. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And the contrary, you should really love...love God and also their fellow man. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And this really opened the eyes to my father, and he was so enthused. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And one of the publications what they brought him was that booklet, Prosperity Sure. (</span><span class="sentence" id="45">Holding up booklet) It incidentally carries our family name, Wohlfahrt Sicher. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And then he said that this must be made known in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And he started preaching the good news of that kingdom, what he believed in, what he prayed for. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">That through that kingdom, the problems of mankind will be solved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So then it was in that year that your father became one of Jehovah's Witnesses?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And he got a assignment in, uh, vicinity for about, uh, sixty kilometers, right up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">You know, to call on people. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And one of the next one what showed interest and became a Witness was, uh, a neighbor, Hans [NB: Johann] Stossier--which, uh, sister I later married, because she became one of Jehovah's Witnesses, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And he helped him to preach in that big <span class="REGION">territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">He had sometime walk up to eight hours in one direction, because he was not able to pay the train fare to those <span class="REGION">outlying areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And so a congregation was formed of about, uh, twenty-four, until, uh, Hitler came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  So what began to happen then to your...your family, to your congregation then, in '33 to '38?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  In the beginning, when in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> the dictator government was established under, uh, Dollfuss.” </span><span class="sentence" id="60">He was then in '34 assassinated, and followed by Chancellor Schuschnigg.” </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And uh, about, uh, 1936, in, uh, February, the work of Jehovah's Witnesses was banned. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And my father was already jailed at that time under the peddling laws--peddling without a license. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So he couldn't pay the fine; so he was then jailed for some days, just by preaching, uh, the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  You mean, he was accused of peddling? * </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Dr. Engelbert Dollfuss was the Austrian chancellor from 1932 until 1934, when he was murdered during a Nazi attempt to seize power in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . * </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Dr. Kurt Schuschnigg was the Austrian chancellor between 1934 and 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">He was imprisoned in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camps</span> during the war, but survived and died at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Innsbruck</span> in 1977.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  For what reason?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  With literatures, that 1t was required--this was just the excuse--uh, he would need a license. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">For that reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  And then things developed, uh, uh, towards '38. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">There were quite some difficulties. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Uh, also with this movement already, some Nazis started preparing; and there was the talk of a takeover of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">In that time, I start apprentice-time for painting; and it was even noticeable in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We were forced to obtain religious instruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And when a priest came in, uh, there was some apprentice what were already over twenty before they got a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And so they objected to the teaching and, uh, presence of the priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And some in the background even hailed Hitler in his presence. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">He was very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And then the priest said, "What's wrong with our religion? </span><span class="sentence" id="83">You have no respect! </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Ask me questions." </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And so nobody, uh, want to ask, after, any questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So I asked the priest, uh, "I would really like, uh, to have some of my questions answered, because, uh, I have some doubts about, uh, that teaching." </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And he said, "That's what I want!" </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And so I asked him for a whole hour the different questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">About, for example, the involvement of the war: how it was possible that in the name of the same religion they were placing the Austrians to kill the Italians. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And, uh, he said that this was the greatest shame. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">It should never happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And at the end of that hour, he came to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">He said, "It never happened to me that anyone asked so many questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And, for example, also about if the Catholic Church can really claim that they are the only true faith." </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So he said, "Believe me, I would rather have a handful Catholics what would die for their faith, but not so many millions what only on the paper." </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And then when he asked where I got this knowledge, uh, of the Bible and, uh, I was able to ask him such questions; so I explained to him that our father teach us from the Bible. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And he said, "You are on the right <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Just continue."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  So what were some of the...the pressures that you began to see from '33 to '38, when Hitler took over [in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ]? </span><span class="sentence" id="100">What were some of the changes that were taking place in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Yes, the changes were a few months later [from] when I had that discussion. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Uh, Hitler moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And then it became really such a, uh, uh, pressure and change. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Uh, people were watched, uh, everything they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">They took account of everyone who did not salute it. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And, for example, I had, uh, refused to answer the Hitler greeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And it took...1t took not too long and I was called before, uh, SA group--some of the party informations that I had refused twelve times the greetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  And what is that greeting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Hail Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And so they want to put me in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But the master painter was avoiding, by excusing, uh, me that I should finish my training and that he needs me. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And so I got still through without being taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  You mean, other people were reporting you? </span><span class="sentence" id="114">On you, ...
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  ...that you wouldn't "Heil, Hitler"?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">There were, uh, papers asking me to answer with a Hitler greeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">But we explained to him that we never will hail a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">That this only belongs to our Creator, Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So then all of this took place when you were still under twenty-one?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  That's right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  And in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , what age is that--the age of twenty-one?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Twenty-one, when you are full responsible. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Uh, like, uh, when you are called in the services, in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Then you are full responsible. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But not before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So then in the year 1938, when Hitler finally took over, what were the things that began to happen to you and to your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  Yes, the first thing was that they called my father for registration. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And in 1939 already, before the Polish War started and, uh, at that Commission, they said it was visible that my father was a invalid, partly from the First World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">He suffered [sublalian (ph)] arthritis; he lost all his teeth right in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And then they said, uh, he should be left alone and sent back, because he had enough from the First World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">But then there was some question put to him by some of the German officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And he said that it would be also against his conscience as one of Jehovah's Witnesses to have anything to do with war. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And despite that he was not eligible for war service, they kept him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">He was transferred in, uh, <span class="BUILDING">military jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And there, uh, he had to wait about three months, uh, [to] be transferred from the, uh, <span class="BUILDING">Vienna Army jail</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And there he was put before the <span class="BUILDING">War Court</span> , the Reichskriegsgericht [Ger: <span class="BUILDING">State War Court</span> ]; and there, he was sentenced with about twenty- eight other Witnesses to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">In the meantime, some of the town[s] people and the former mayor, uh, put up a petition; and, uh, they were signed by most of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Even some Nazis sent in letters of recommendations. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And this was all ignored. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And the one who had started that petition was nearly put to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And they warned him not to do anything like that anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">There were still people favored; and they liked my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">In that letter was stated he was an example for the community, that he was a very loving neighbor and that he helped everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">But this didn't help anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">They beheaded him. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And it is really a coincidence that today 1s that very day. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">The 7th December of 1935 [1939]--fifty years since my father was beheaded.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  You mean, 1939?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  Yes, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">On the 7th...7th of December; that's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Today [is] fifty years since that date.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  Now, did you mention before that your two brothers were also there as well, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  Uh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">At...at that tume, uh, there were some other, uh, uh, Witnesses from, uh...some from that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But my...I was put uh, uh...three months later, uh, I was called up in the work services [NB: Arbeitsdienst]. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">But my second oldest brother [Gregor Jr.] was, uh, called, after he became twenty-one, uh, to the air force [NB: Luftwaffe]. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And he took the stand of one of Jehovah's Witnesses; and he was sentenced to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And they waited nearly five months with the execution. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Because, uh, everyone had the chance to sign a form that he 1s not following anymore Jehovah's Witnesses; and also, that he breaks, uh, his oath to Jehovah God and is willing to serve Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">My father had one month time. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And my brother--twenty- two year old brother--had two...uh, five months time; but he did not, uh, sign the paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">But this were ...this was very hard for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I had the occasion to meet one of the barbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">He [the barber] was transferred from the <span class="INT_SPACE">execution chamber</span> of uh...to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And he was, uh, cutting his hair and shaving him. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And he noticed that I had the same name; and he remembered that this was my brother what he was, uh, serving there in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And he said it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">He had, day and night, heavy chains on their arms and weights on their legs before the execution. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">They only were taken off during mealtime, or when they used the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  What was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> or the <span class="NPIP">place</span> your brother was at, before he was executed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  This was...most were executed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> --in [the] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pl6tzensee</span> , where thousands were executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And some were executed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brandenburg</span> , also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And some were executed in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> ; like, uh, from our congregation there were different ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Uh, even some were gassed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Well, since Jehovah's Witnesses were such a small group, why was Hitler interested in killing them or destroying them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  Yes, uh, because of their firm stand that they were staying neutral and not taking part in Hitler's, uh, goal to rule the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And they feared if more people would take that stand, so it would be very damaging. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And that's why it came up, uh, even in all the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">For example, Pastor NiemGller* was saying in that connection, after the war in one of his big * Martin Nieméller was head of the anti-Nazi Confessing Church from 1937. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">He was interned in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> --usually in solitary confinement--until liberated by the Americans in 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">gatherings, "If we had taken the stand with the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic Church</span> as true Christians, Hitler could have never gone that far. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And there's no excuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Because many are saying, today, "We were forced to take part in that war. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">We were forced by Hitler.'" </span><span class="sentence" id="191">He said--Pastor Niemoller-- "We have seen a group of Christians which were not only giving up their freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Many were giving up their lives, to keep faith alive in those dark days. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">These were Jehovah's Witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And if they were able do it, we could have done it." </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And the same comment made even, uh, before, by Chancellor Adenauer’ ina letter, according to Der Spiegel. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And Eisenhower, where he said the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> had a great responsibility in the concen...on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">If they had spoken up, Hitler could have never, uh, be able to bring about these terrible things in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  Now, why was it that they beheaded, uh, your father and brother and other Jehovah's Witnesses, instead of just shooting them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  Yes, they did, uh, shoot only, uh, two brothers I know from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">But, uh, 1t was then changed, because they were not worth it being executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">This was a honorable way of execution. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And beheading was dishonorable. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">This was the reason.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">As I mentioned, we had always these difficulties from, uh, the Nazi organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And we were watched. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And, uh, I was staying at that time with...still with that master painter. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And just occasionally, I was for a few hours able to see them and get some literatures, and get encouragement from my dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And my dad always said, "Just prepare yourself." </span><span class="sentence" id="255">You know, because we didn't, uh, know, uh, all what went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">But he did mention that in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> they have great difficulties, and they were informed. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">That but he didn't told us in details what really happened; but he encouraged us to be prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">That the very difficults time...uh, difficult times are ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And this helped us. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">When I got after the call to the work service, after his execution, that I took the stand and refused to take part. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Because I knew that this is just a cover-up. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">They called it "work service" but it was a real... such rough training, uh--what I mention later what incidents happened in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp--</span> just be prepared for the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And I refused that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION:  So the "work service" wasn't really a work service. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">It was preparing you for the military, you're trying to tell us?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">They...they were, before the war they were using that for building <span class="DLF">roads</span> and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So I thought this is nothing wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">But when I was called up, the first thing they explained us: "Now we're going to use the spade instead [of] the gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And we're going to make all this exercises with the gun...with that, uh, spade representing the gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And then, in a few weeks when the training 1s over, you're going to get the real thing--a beautiful gun." </span><span class="sentence" id="272">They showed there in that, uh, compound, you know, where they had the exercises. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And I refused then to take part also in the singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">They asked us to sing these, uh, Nazi songs: "And today, uh, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> belongs to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">But what tomorrow, the whole world. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And then we're going to march against <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And I refused it. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And they were amazed at that, the officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Eespecially, some of the German officers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">QUESTION:  So how did they treat you then, as a result of you not doing that in front of all the troops?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">ANSWER:  Yes, there was a other, uh, incident, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And that evening, they gave me the last warning-- that I must be the first one tomorrow, and also dress in that uniform with the swastika. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And so I told them ahead of time I will not take part. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And then they told me to send my civilian clothing <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">But during the night, I was talking to the other recruits of my stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And in the morning, I had all the uniforms what we received the day before packed in a sheet. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And then in the morning, I put my civilian clothing on. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And they were warning me before. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">They were with me, the officers, first for hours threatening me. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Threatening me that they're going to shoot me, and all kinds of, uh, threats. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">But in the morning, they told me I must be one of the first one in <span class="DLF">line</span> out in the <span class="DLF">exercising grounds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And I didn't came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And then the officer, the German officer, came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And he was shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">I was in civilian clothes; I had all the military stuff in that wrapped blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And he ordered me to change right away, you know, in the uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And I refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I said, "I told you last night." </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And then he called for the commander, and with whom I had for hours discussions. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And he said, "I respected that you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">But you said you are willing to do work." </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And so I explained to him, "Yes, I would have worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">But yesterday, there was no work involved at all in the exercises. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Only military training. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And I told you ahead of time." </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And then he said, "Then, I understand." </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Then they had to put me in a <span class="INT_SPACE">dungeon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And from there, they threatened me. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Especially these German officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">They didn't allow me to shave. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">They said, "If you believe in Christ Jesus, you should wear a beard." </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And made fun of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And then midnight...after midnight, they came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">These heavy locks, you know, were moved that you just jumped up. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I had to sleep on a board, and just got water and bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And so they tried to soften [me]. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And they said, "I'm going to hit you there, that you're going to give up." </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And he was very, uh...a very rough, uh, officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">But I did not give in. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">The next day I supposed to, uh, go in front of all the recruits and salute the flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">If not, they said something terrible is going to happen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And they ..about four hundred recruits and all the officers were standing there; and I had to march by and greet that big flag in front of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And so I walked by. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And I just said, "Good day." </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And they were so mad that I had to walk back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">QUESTION:  You mean, you wouldn't salute the swastika.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Because I was taken a... Just like the three Hebrews, what, uh, supposed to bow down in front of the image of, uh, the King Nebuchadnezzar. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">So I refused that. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And then I was put back in a <span class="INT_SPACE">dungeon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And those who were guarding me, they said, "We were so afraid that they going to shoot you." </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Because all evenings we are just discussing Jehovah's Witnesses and their stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And they told me, "Yes, you are right. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">We...we would... We don't like to have any part in that, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">But where do you get this strength? </span><span class="sentence" id="336">You know, we...we just are not able to do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="337">So I explained to him that "Only through the spirit of Jehovah God, we are able to take the stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">We are not able from...to do anything from ourselves, because, uh, we are just like any of you--uh weak men. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">But with the spirit of God, we are able to take our stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And we are not fearing death." </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And, uh, one of the soldiers said, uh...he said, "We were so amazed that you had no fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">That you had even a little smile on your face, when you walked by when they ordered you to salute that flag."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  Now, you...you were saying that an officer came to you and tried to force you. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Now, he was the head of all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> or something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, uh, there are different ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">But it was interesting, that, uh, in the meantime I watched, uh, through my <span class="INT_SPACE">dungeon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">There was a little crack; and I could see how they were drilled, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">These exercises were so hard that some of them, uh, uh, became so ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Had pneumonia, some of them; and some died. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And I witnessed myself when they were carrying them out in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffins</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And, uh, can you imagine? </span><span class="sentence" id="352">There were two cases there what died. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">That was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> uh, uh, |Dietersdorf (ph)], <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arbeitsdienst Camp</span> |Dietersdorf (ph)], uh, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Burgenland</span> --in east, uh, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , close to the <span class="DLF">Hungarian border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And can you imagine? </span><span class="sentence" id="355">There were some, uh, high ranking officers--uh, like one of the higher ranking officers, uh, his name was, uh, Mayer--he came into my <span class="INT_SPACE">dungeon</span> and said to me that he has a high respect for our stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">He said, "And I know there are even laws that you could refuse that, as conscientious objector. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">But all these laws are made...will be made, uh, invalid through new laws, what, uh, don't give you the chance to be a conscientious objector." </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And he was trying to influence me--and also some other officers--if I would run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Just go over the <span class="DLF">border</span> , so that they would save my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And they even on purpose--I didn't know-- left the <span class="INT_SPACE">dungeon</span> open during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">But they honestly meant--these were Austrian officers--to save my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">But I told them that I would not do that, because, uh, we want, uh, to stand even if we loose the life. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">We want not to compromise. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And also, we would have endangered our relatives--my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Also, we were planning to get married, uh, with, uh, Hans Stossier's sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And they would have been taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Because this was, uh, known all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> : 1f anyone fled to another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> or was hiding-- like some did, to hide from their responsibility as soldiers--all their relatives were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And we know personally some what were gassed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Very few survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">QUESTION:  Now, you said there was one officer in that camp that came to you particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And he was the head of all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And he tried to pressure you in to saluting the swastika?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Uh, this was, uh, closer to the end of my thirty-three days in that <span class="INT_SPACE">dungeon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , uh, Doctor Mendinger. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">He was in charge of all the pre-military training of the troops; and, uh, he tried to persuade me, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Uh, I was brought before him; and he said, "You are not aware what will happen to you." </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I said, "I am aware." "</span><span class="sentence" id="379">No, no! </span><span class="sentence" id="380">That's easy talk," he said. "</span><span class="sentence" id="381">You know what laws are in force now?" </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And so... And he said, uh, I should, uh, think what a big future is ahead for every young Germans. "</span><span class="sentence" id="383">We're going to rule the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And you're going to be part in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And you are very valuable, a valuable citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Uh, so far, we have information about you. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And we do not want that you lose your life because just somebody has talked you in." </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I said, "No, that is my own conviction. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And then, that we rather lay down our life for Jehovah God, for righteous principles. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And that we don't become blood guilty." </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And he said, "No, you are not aware what, uh, lies ahead of you." </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And then I told him just a few weeks ago my father had been beheaded for similar reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Then he was shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">He said then I know; he gave me still the order. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And then he felt just exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">He was trying to convince me and [NB: to] give up my faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">So now, after the thirty-three days in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">dungeon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Where did they take you to next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">ANSWER:  I was taken then to a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for investigation. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And from there, I was transferred to the Gestapo in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Graz</span> --about sixty or seventy kilometres...kilometers, in the capital city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Styria</span> [province]. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And there, I was threatened by the Gestapo men: "And, uh, then you're going to see what will happen, if you take a Fuhrerless stand!" </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And I was charged with, uh, uh, demoralizing, you know, the spirit of the recruits--by making statements that I will never give an oath to Hitler, I will never fight for him, I will never wear the Nazi insignias and that I rather be willing to die than to serve Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And for that reason, I was put before a special <span class="BUILDING">court</span> of three judges. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And, uh, they also, uh, assigned a lawyer what supposed to defend me; but he said, "What shall I do if you don't give up? </span><span class="sentence" id="406">You know, it will be not much use." </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And then the judges, uh, based their judgment on my uh faith. "</span><span class="sentence" id="408">And, uh, we respect your stand," uh, one of the judges said.

<p><span class="sentence" id="573">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Uh, the most difficult, uh, time was when the winter came. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">The cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">The snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">We had to get up, uh, at least around five o'clock in the morning; and there was always a...a rushing to get a little bit of that, uh, uh, breakfast, and then... Which consisted of a little bit black, uh, substitute coffee and, uh, some little bread; but, uh, you couldn't call it bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">It was really, uh... There were food what they had given us there, that kno...that came to us known for very poor food. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">There was turnips; and also some dead animals were grinded, uh, 1n that, uh, vegetable soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And even some diseases developed from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And we were sometimes covered--or for the bigger part during our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> time--with boils. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And the odor of that food was even so bad, when some kommandos who worked in this bombed out <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> that people were complaining--when some of these prisoners were transported 1n one of these uh, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> to the jobs--that they became sick just smelling that type of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">So, [it] gives you some idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">But when you had hunger, you still had to eat something. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And that's why we became, uh, quite weak, through that, uh, poor food. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And some prisoners what came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , they always remarked, uh, this was a golden food--what they were getting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau--</span> compared with ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">But the worst thing was in the morning, the Appell--as they called it: lining up the different working kommandos. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And they took hours, until some were replaced what took sick or some what died, so that they had the full number through newcomers. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And then they count...the counting. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And in that time, they always commanded us to stand still; but when you were poorly dressed, and, uh, that wind and that snow, it was automatically that we were shivering. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And, uh, there was really a difficult time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">QUESTION:  Hmm. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">So that's how your day started. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And from there, you went to where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">ANSWER:  Yes, then we were loaded on, uh...on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">On...

<p><span class="sentence" id="603">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">So then, what did the work day consist of?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="617">QUESTION:  Did you have heat in your <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> at nighttime?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">ANSWER:  Uh, practically there was no heat. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">There was a little ovened areas; but, uh, there were some, uh, uh, poor constructed <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">You know, the wind and snow blowed through. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">We were really shivering all the night through.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="627">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Uh, as I say, there was, uh, mainly assigned to this, uh, uh, uh, digging <span class="DLF">trenches</span> and digging out <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And toward, uh, '43, they were...uh, there was a change. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">A new commander came; and he had, uh, occupied, uh, a new <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> , and it needed painting. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And they found out that I am a...a tradesman. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And so they called me out from that job. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And I was uh able to do some work for that uh commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And because of doing that work, uh, I was able, uh, to talk to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And especially, uh, he was, uh, very, uh, surprised... There was no wallpaper available. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And before, the painters just put some whitewash on; and this colored off. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And I noticed in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where also experimented not only fertilizers, also from I. G. Farben, different paint materials--like, uh, latex sealers. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And with these sealers, I imitated then wallpaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And he was so surprised what, uh, I was able to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">There's still one of these few patterns, what I was making the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> with. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Uh... (Holding up samples) And this was the occasion, too, where the camp commander was, uh, asking me... They called me up for the military service, because they were short on man materials, to <span class="REGION">Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And then...
QUESTION:  Now, what was that year now that they called you up for that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="643">ANSWER:  This was, uh, the end of '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And then the commander asked me what my stand is. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And, uh, in the meantime, we... During my work, we already discussed some of our, uh, stand as Jehovah's Witnesses--about our neutrality. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And even the wife [of] the commander made remark we really do not, uh, deserve that we are in such a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And the commander said, yes, he doesn't regard me as a law-breaker--I'm just here because of my faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And when I received the call, then I was preparing myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Because I knew already from experience that everyone in our congregation was, uh, executed what, uh, refused, uh, the military services.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">QUESTION:  Just to go back for a few moments, uh, to the wallpaper again-- or really, the paint. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">How did that happen to, uh...to help you with that commandant of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="652">That wallpaper--or that paint, I should say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Uh, when his wife came in, uh, she asked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">I really shouldn't... She couldn't imagine that I have done something wrong, that I, uh...why I am in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And so the commander said, uh, "No, I don't regard, uh, that he has done anything wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">He's just here because of that faith in Jehovah God." </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And so he was able to, uh, get a setting back of my call for six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And he saved me being brought before the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> in, uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">QUESTION:  You mean, all because you were able to...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">ANSWER:  Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And mainly... Uh, first of all, I was able to do the job not only for him; but they gave me some other job, even to high ranking government official. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I even had to, uh, paint and, uh, repair, and restore as a wood finishing in some of the <span class="BUILDING">government offices</span> in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="664">They even, uh, put some other, uh, civilian, uh, overalls over my prisoner clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And this helped me, that I, uh, was spared from execution. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And what I found out later, that this was all the work of that commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Otherwise, I would have not survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">QUESTION:  What was the impression that he first got when he saw that... that "wallpaper"--which he thought was wallpaper--on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> , when he walked in with his wife?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="669">ANSWER:  Yah, he thought that I got somewhere a wallpaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">But none was, uh, made, uh, during that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And then he even looked how I closely, uh, joined the paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">He couldn't find, uh, the joints. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">So I explained him after; and then he was really amazed, and he really appreciated that type of work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="674">QUESTION:  And how about his wife?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="675">ANSWER:  And his wife, she appreciated also. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Because she had a lot of cleaning, uh, to do before. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">When they, uh, touched the <span class="DLF">walls</span> , it was all over their clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">There was just whitewash on. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">But this new material, latex paint, was washable and very durable. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And then she realized, because I was so skinny. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">She disappeared and came back with a big plate of, uh, sandwiches. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And you could see that there were still some people what had feeling and understanding for us, and they felt sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Or, sometime when we were walking to the different <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> , marching, German people threw their apples and food, uh, stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">But sometime the guards, you know, when they noticed that, they warned them they will take them with...uh, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="685">But people were really, uh, seeing what has been done, you know, to German people, just because of their faith or their political views.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">QUESTION:  So then, because of your ability to paint and make it look like wallpaper, it actually helped to save your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">ANSWER:  That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And I had also opportunity in this experimental <span class="DLF">farms</span> , which were designed and built after models from Jehovah's Witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">There were some very capable, uh, uh, model carpenters. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And I had to work then in those <span class="DLF">farms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And there, I had the opportunity--because of orders from the commander--that I could move quite freely, and even, uh, talk to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Uh, some were...uh, some lost their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and were bombed out; and so, temporarily, they lived in that <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Uh, some of the German people. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And, uh, they asked me, uh, "How is it possible, uh, you, uh, still have a...a...? </span><span class="sentence" id="696">You behave so different than the others, and you have still a smile on your face--even in that misery what you are in. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">Why are you here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And then I told them, "I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses." "</span><span class="sentence" id="699">What?! </span><span class="sentence" id="700">They are putting you in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> just because of your faith?! </span><span class="sentence" id="701">What does your dad say, that...your mother, that you are in that condition?" </span><span class="sentence" id="702">I said, "Sure, 1t is very hard for my mother, because she lost already our father. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">He was beheaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">My brother was beheaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And the children taken away." </span><span class="sentence" id="706">They couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">They start to cry. (</span><span class="sentence" id="708">Crying) They said, "What?! </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Such things are done in...1n <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?!" (</span><span class="sentence" id="710">Crying) You know, they try to... also to help me with food; or when I got this terrible dysentery and a touch of this typhoid fever, they were the ones what sent--through some guards and workers what were assigned to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp--</span> some charcoal tablets and, uh, uh, some medication, so that I've did survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">I just owe it to those people that they helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">And can you imagine? </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And other thing, what I would never think of: because I told them that I have to prepare myself (pause -crying) for the execution, (crying) that it was a arrangement made... Can you imagine? </span><span class="sentence" id="714">One day, I come to work and I was comforted with my mother (crying) and Mary--my bride, my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">They arranged--can you imagine?--that I had a special work to do in that experimental farm; and they called them from, uh, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , you know, that I would be able to see them before the execution.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">QUESTION:  You mean, those people that lived there arranged this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="717">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">QUESTION:  So that you could be...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Can you imagine what the danger was involved? </span><span class="sentence" id="722">If they had found out, you know, they would have, uh, executed them right away, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">QUESTION:  And so you, uh...when it came to Maria, she was able to come to see you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">ANSWER:  Yes, and my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And, uh, even, once, the uncle was there what was later gassed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="726">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Well, would you describe that meeting with your mother and with Maria?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">ANSWER:  Yah, it was just unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">You can imagine that was also for me a great encouragement, because, uh, I was so cut off from other, uh, Witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And, uh, my mother and Mary, they encouraged me. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">But, uh, you can imagine how we appreciated that. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">We could never forget that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">QUESTION:  Now, where was it you met? </span><span class="sentence" id="734">In a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="735">In a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">ANSWER:  In that, uh, in that <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> , where they were living; because ...uh, that <span class="DLF">experimental farm</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">QUESTION:  Well, how was your mother and Maria able to get from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> all the way over to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="738">ANSWER:  Yes, they were able to, uh, take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> still, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">But later, this was very difficult; because they were bombed on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And again, for a number of times, uh, Mary was able to visit me; but under very great, uh, difficulties, because the bombing increased. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And also it was the danger of, uh, of that, uh...you know, what was involved with the guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">If they had found out, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">But I owe it just to the commander that I had that freedom without the guards, you know, uh [to] do these different jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="744">QUESTION:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">You mean, the commander would permit you to go to different <span class="NPIP">locations</span> without any guards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="746">ANSWER:  That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">That was, uh...I just owe it to him that he, uh, ordered the, uh, guards to leave me alone, despite that there were some protesting about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And uh, they also, uh, toward the end of the war they tried to, to perse...prosecute him about those, uh, things. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">He was also in great danger.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">QUESTION:  Himself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Because the guards, uh, felt, uh, that he is trying to make friends with the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">But he really, uh, helped us in many ways, you know, to make our situation easier.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="754">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">Now, as the war began to draw to a close then, how many times did he help to spare your life then? </span><span class="sentence" id="757">A total of how many times?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Uh, he avoided my call, and so the execution, three times. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">The third time, he offered me civilian clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And he said to me, "Be very, very careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">I had, uh, great difficulties to keep you alive until this day." </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And so, he was, uh, doing everything he could, uh, what was possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And he had the opportunity, you know, to hold back my call. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And only I owe it to him that he was, uh, saving my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">QUESTION:  Hmm. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And at that time, how much did you weigh about at that time? </span><span class="sentence" id="769">How much did you weigh when you went in, and how much...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="770">ANSWER:  There was about at that time 150 pounds; and then I came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">So around, uh, 90...about uh, 88, 90 pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="772">QUESTION:  And you were saying that the foods that were being presented to you prisoners was experimental foods?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="773">ANSWER:  Yes, they also had experimental foods. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Uh, artificial margarine, and then artificial tomato soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">For example, it was such a sensation of, uh, burning that, uh, we had to drink by the quarts water after the meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And also different, uh... different types of, uh, soups they produced there, they would try it on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">We had, for example, for days--when we had that soup--uh, uh, orange colored mouths. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And the color didn't get away for days, when we had that soup.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="779">QUESTION:  Was there any reaction to your body, when you took 1n that... that food that was prepared with chemicals?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="780">ANSWER:  Yes, there's one thing I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">That, uh, quite a bit of stomach trouble developed. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And we noticed, especially, toward the end when we were liberated and we got the first meal, I nearly died. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I couldn't stand anything, and for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And even today, I have to be very careful in eating rich food or ...or certain drinks I have to avoid.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="785">QUESTION:  You were saying that the potatoes they used to make with chemicals or chemical fertilizers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">ANSWER:  Yes, they used a lot of fertilizers. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And they were just like an acid, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">It was too much of the chemicals in there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">QUESTION:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Now let's go toward the end of the war now. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And the commandant was able to keep you alive up to that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">What began to happen, as the American troops began to get closer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="793">ANSWER:  Yes, when the American troops came closer, also with the low flying <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> they dropped leaflets over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and warned the guards not to harm us. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">That they are going to be brought to justice if they would, uh, do anything to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">Then they flew into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , right through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And they shot down the guards from the watch...from the surrounding <span class="BUILDING">watch towers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And, uh, there was quite a...a situation, uh, through the bombing raids too, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">We had to stand just in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ; and sometimes they were moving back and forth from the big bombings of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and the surrounding <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And also some bombs were dropped quite close to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="800">But we were never, uh, hit, or...or injured.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="801">QUESTION:  Now, who came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> then to free you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="802">ANSWER:  Yes, uh, as I found out when the Americans came closer, the commander--what I found out later--uh, he got orders to defend that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Soon the Americans arrive to open fire; and they had a lot of...we were surprised how much munition and, uh, armaments they had in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Piles of, uh, machine guns and ammunition and grenades, and all kinds of weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And the commander said, "Yes, yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="806">He will follow these orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">But when the Americans arrived, he put out a white flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">He tried to keep so many guards as possible there, so that, uh, the order was, uh, kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">But those who have committed crimes or murdered prisoners or tortured some, uh, they fled during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">But still the bigger part of the guards, uh, stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And we were then surrounded from all sides by General Patton's, uh, troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And in that time, I was already in civilian clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And I was, uh, quite, uh, a friend of one of the Norwegian high-ranking officers from the air force. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">His name was [Videreu (ph)]. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And, uh, he was having experience with Jehovah's Witnesses in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> already; and he said he respected us very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">And, uh, because he was such a high-ranking officer, they allowed him to get occasionally some parcel from the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And even he shared some of the little food with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And uh, he was the one what, uh, welcomed the American troops, because he spoke, uh, fluent English, German, and French.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="819">QUESTION:  All right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="820">ANSWER:  And they were really surprised, you know, what they found.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="821">QUESTION:  Now what happened to that commandant of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="822">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">When we, uh, were liberated, but they didn't let, uh, all, uh, prisoners out. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">Because there were also criminal prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And the camp commander did not, uh, destroyed any records; so the political prisoners took care to sort them out, that only political or religious, uh, persecuted prisoners would go free. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And so, uh, they offered me as the first one to walk out, the American, uh, officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And, uh, they really couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">That English...uh this Norwegian officer explained them why I was in there as one of Jehovah's Witnesses, and that so many from our family were already, uh, executed, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And they couldn't believe in what state that we were in. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And, uh, so the officer, or the commandant or the other officers, were were all jailed just in one of these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and, uh, guarded by the American troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And then we went straight to the American officers and testified. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">You know, about that he really tried to help us, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">That he got even some extra food, and then that he avoided some of the executions and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And in about three days, he was freed. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">But other, uh, guards and officers were brought before the <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">Some what were committing some crimes; but most of the dangerous ones, they all escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">The majority escaped.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="838">QUESTION:  Tell me, now... Now, when you got back to your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> congregation, how many did you find alive? </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Or what had happened to your congregation?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="893">QUESTION:  And in what year did that take place then, that you found out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="894">ANSWER:  This was about '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And to cover up the whole affair, they sent a condolence telegram-the SS commander of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> --to my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Who was also, uh, quite ill; and later she was also in the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo jail</span> , and took so serious ill and had no treatment. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And she died, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">But just shortly before, you know, they sent here even a telegram: that they did everything, uh, for her husband, but his, uh, uh, stomach ulcer got so bad that he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And that...that was the cause; and if she wanted to have his, uh, ashes sent. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">Just to cover up, you know, what they had really done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="902">QUESTION:  So then, now after the war and after you were freed, you went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And, well, what did you find at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="904">What were the conditions like at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="905">ANSWER:  Yes, uh, you can imagine how many did not came back anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">But, uh, those of the Witnesses what did survived, even in that state we were so glad that we did not, uh, compromise. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And that anything, even the difficult life whatever--there's not much food around and all kinds of difficulties. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">But it was nothing, compared what we went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And that we never regretted that we had, uh, spent such years in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , or that so many died. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Because we knew ahead of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">Even Jesus said when we will follow his example that we will have to expect persecution. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">The same when they persecuted him, they will persecute you also. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And how true it really became, and how glad we were that we did not took the sword. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">Like Jesus said, "All those who take the sword will die by the sword." </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And that no problems in this world can be solved just by force. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Even the former President, uh, Eisenhower, who was also so shocked liberating us; he made a comment tn his last book that Jehovah's Witnesses are really true conscientious objectors. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">That he, as a military man, accept us; and that Jehovah's Witnesses never tried to solve problems by force, but all with love. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And that is what we really firmly believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">That only through God's kingdom, the Creator will really bring about the restoration of all things, the earth to <span class="NPIP">paradise</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And where all this wickedness what went on in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , and what still goes on all over the world, that this will come to an end--like, uh, Psalms 37, 10 and 11 shows that, uh, you will look around and the wicked one will be no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">But those who really trust in Jehovah God, the humble ones will possess this earth, and will really enjoy then happiness and peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="922">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Now you have a Bible there that was sent back from one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="924">Would you like to tell us about that Bible?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="925">ANSWER:  Yes, this Bible was, uh, sent back after my brother-in-law was executed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And uh, you can see it 1s quite worn out and beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Sometimes it was even in some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="928">But this was the miracle, that we were able to keep it what had given them strength through these difficult days. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And, uh, we would like to donate that Bible, uh, to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , as a proof that God's word has helped and strengthened those who were really bearing witness for the great God, Jehovah, during these difficult times.</span></p>

(</span><span class="sentence" id="937">2) (a) This 1s a... This is a imitation of wallpaper with, uh, design rollers and, uh, latex paint. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">This is just a more simple imitation, but sometimes it was done in four or five colors and very different designs. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">Some looked like materials. (</span><span class="sentence" id="940">b) And this is another one, also along that <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And this helped me to survive when I did the work for that camp commander. (</span><span class="sentence" id="942">3) [Wall plaque, made of wood and painted.] </span><span class="sentence" id="943">This is a Bible verse from Proverbs, the third chapter, [verses] 5 and 6. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And this I made, to send it through one of the workers and guards in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp [</span> to my family]. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">That was in the time where I was waiting for the execution, and just to give my family encouragement. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And it did came out, and they received it. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">And I still was in possession until today. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And it is a reminder how really God's word has strengthened us under those most difficult days. (</span><span class="sentence" id="949">4) And this is the only notification of the execution of my father to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">She never received any letters, or any proofs that my father had committed anything against the law, or that he was sentenced to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">And we inquired just lately, at that very <span class="NPIP">place</span> where he was executed, for some information; and there are no more records. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">They all disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">And this is still a living proof that this type of persecution and Holocaust really happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And it is unbelievable that today many are having doubts about it.</span></p>
