QUESTION:  Who did this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My Uncle who survived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2">He was the officer of Polish Air Force. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">| used the coins for about two years to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">| didn't do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">It was, situation very chaotic in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">The Communists took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">The only chance was to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">So | thought, well, there's time to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">| registered, | had saved all my documents, they were buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">All my documents except my High School Degree, which somehow was lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">But | did have my University Degrees, my University books, and attendance in the classes, and fortunately all the professors from my former <span class="BUILDING">University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luneburg</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Woolf</span> (ph), they moved to <span class="REGION">Western Poland</span> at that time, and | decided to move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , , former <span class="REGION">German territory</span> , where the same professor of my former <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , Woolf (ph), resided now in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">So | registered with no problem whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">The papers were okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">The only thing is there was another Jewish student with me, don't recall exactly where he came from, but the remarks | heard in the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">It was, another two Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Hitler didn't kill all of you? </span><span class="sentence" id="17">You know, and the class was so annoying, not annoying but frightening even. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And the common trend was at that time the refugees Felix Horn 4 [Date not labeled] Page 4 coming back from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , not finding no purpose living in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , they all were going West.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Let me ask you about that a little bit, just the atmosphere in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">The Nazis were gone, but as you're describing, it was still not a very friendly environment for Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit more about what that was like? </span><span class="sentence" id="23">What that felt like’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  Well, just to mention here that | was raised in a rather very modern <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> , although my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Just because kosher was believed to be healthier and free of any contamination and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">But my father was very progressive man. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">First he was a locksmith then he became an architect with night education and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">He was a modern person. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And we were living away from the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish center</span> mostly so | had a formal Jewish education. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">| had a teacher come to my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> teaching me religion, Torah, you know, Hum-ish (ph), all the biblical stories and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">| never spoke Yiddish though. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">My parents spoke Yiddish to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">| brought from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , | was going to a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> , Yiddish was foreign to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">But | did understand everything they were saying but they were talking to me in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">| was so comfortable, my Polish is really impeccable. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Poles have difficult time to look at me, | have Semitic look though. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And then my Polish is so different Felix Horn 9) [Date not labeled] Page 5 than the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">You can spot a Jew during the war, they looked super. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">In other words, they looked like typical Pole, Nordic type. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Blonde, blue eyes, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">| have a very short nose and the way they walked and so on you can tell the difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Jews were walking more as bent , kind of scared a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Even peaceful time, they are looking left and right. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Someone might be hitting them or attack them or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">It didn't have to be a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">You could be hit by one person, only two people, but young hooligans. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Seven, nine, ten years old throwing stones, hitting with a piece of anything, an iron pipe, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So, you know, | was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">| was straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">My Polish was impeccable as they say but they knew who | was because | did return to my original name, which is not classical Polish but its not Jewish or Yiddish either. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Horn is really rather German or Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Van Horn, Von Horn, they are German names. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So there was a little confusion, wanted to know who | am. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">No one dared to ask me exactly, are you a Jew or not? </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But then shortly in <span class="BUILDING">classes</span> | didn't hide it. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">| didn't have no reason to hide it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">| was hiding all those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So then they come and seek it, who | am. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So there was people, | still have quite a few friends, Polish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">But many of them were for safety or security reasons, to say, shy away from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">They exchange words with me rather polite and so on but not very cordial. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So | felt very uncomfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And then during the pilgrim in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> Felix Horn 6 [Date not labeled] Page 6 | got fired to existing situation, you know, and we felt, we felt very insecure. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And being young, saying what am | going to do in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="66">| couldn't live in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that | didn't have a <span class="DLF">grave</span> to go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">We had nobody left. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">My Uncle went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">The other one converted to Christianity, the first one. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">They had nothing to do with Judaism, they had nothing to do with me either because | was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Not that he hated the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Why did he do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="74">| don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We never talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">He was not a person | could have a dialogue with anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">When | left | didn't say good-bye to him, he was not very interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So talking to a few other students of other departments in <span class="BUILDING">University</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">University school</span> , philosophical department, so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We talked about it and | inquire how they feel about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="80">What would they do? </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Would they stay here? </span><span class="sentence" id="82">What are their plans actually? </span><span class="sentence" id="83">They were all in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  These were other Jewish students?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Pardon me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  These were other Jewish students or?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  Who?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  That you were speaking with about this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  Some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But most of them not. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">But they admitted who they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">They were Jewish and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And we all agreed that probably it is time to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">It would Felix Horn 7 [Date not labeled] Page 7 have to be illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">There was no legal way for them to have left. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">You didn't have no visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">You have nobody over seas to send us legal papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Besides those papers would take ages before you get legal entry, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Even after you get you're visa you might take five, ten years. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Some of my friends had to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> because it was much faster to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> they say than wait in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> for you're number to come up and not to be recognized, especially if you're a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And so | organized a student Kibbutz (ph), an academic Kibbutz (ph) of students. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And | think in Hebrew they call it Kibbutz acadamime (ph) if | recall correctly, what | was told. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">| was not good at Hebrew either. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">| read Hebrew, | read my Prayer Book and so on but | don't understand them. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">| read automatically. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">| know the text, what it means, but not word by word. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">But my wife speaks Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And we elected to leave and we made contact with some what they call a Bree-ha (ph), | don't know if you're familiar with that word? </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Bree-ha (ph) is a group of young, Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">The avant-garde of the Pal-mach (ph), of the Jewish driving force of information of Israeli Armed Forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Those are the young people who are politically involved in Zionist organizations and they are pioneering, collecting the remnants of whatever is left over for the Jewish people to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">There was no <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And this was one of the stages, first to get us out of the hostile <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where people didn't want to give us back nothing what we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Asa Felix Horn 8 [Date not labeled] Page 8 matter of fact all my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> was given to some neighbors and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">They refused to give me anything, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="116">They belonged to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">The fur coats and radios, instead of give to the Nazis we give to the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">They did not have to relinquish their status. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And we gave to them, good idea, that if we survived we'd get something back, at least something. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Talking about silverware, the candelabra that were a few hundred years old, heavy, tall. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">All those things perished of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">They, when they found out that | am alive, you know, they said the Germans took it, they had to sell it, some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">They couldn't survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Anyway, it was immaterial anymore to me, | lost more than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And with this we made a contact with the bra- ha (ph) and on a given night all gathered and by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> we are going to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> near the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">From there we were met by a group of people, we never really introduced before. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">They knew about us though. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And with their help and their contacts with the border police and so on, they just looked the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We went right across the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Don't forget, this was, at that time it was 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Still people coming and going to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , looking for family. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">From <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Looking for some. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">survivors, different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So the guards at the <span class="DLF">border</span> were not very religious in stopping people. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Even if they seen somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">There was no invasion or so, there was a peaceful type of a bi-directional type of movement, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">But anyway, as a Felix Horn 9 [Date not labeled] Page 9 group maybe we would create suspicion so we were able to get from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">They put us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And then over there we were met by a group of Zionists, all Zionists. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And they were very instrumental. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Thanks to them, they saved us in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">First they had contact with the local authorities, also notorious. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Don't forget they had a lot of influence because Austrian authorities were more Nazi than the German Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So they were very, very guilty during the war, what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So for that reason alone probably they tried to collaborate with the Jewish organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">First we got a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to our disposal. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">We have no <span class="BUILDING">home</span> so they give us a whole <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and there were twenty or twenty-one of us, two married couples and some girls and some boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So we had to divide the one huge <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , it was like a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> of some kind or an <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span> , with sheets, wires, and we cover, you know, separate, like small <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> over there like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And it was very comfortable really. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And they took all of our documents, I'm talking about student books and our academically type of documentation, and they translate everything for us into German. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And they, having some contacts at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> , we didn't have to go to a very rigorous type of screening or so, as long as our documents were in order, then they segregated us into different facilities and who ever was in medicine, some were first time that they started the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">| was already a third Felix Horn 10 [Date not labeled] Page 10 year medical school student, fourth year. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">| had one year after the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> so this would be my fourth year. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">But medicine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was seven years so | still had four, five, six, four more years to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">In German, that | never handled. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">| spoke French. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">| speak Slavic languages, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, never German. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">But | learn it fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And they were accepted, they accepted all my former papers and exams | passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Maybe because we were survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I'm sure there was some bearing to it, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="164">They did not let us suffer, they wanted to make it as smooth as a transition until they knew, around this new <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , as they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Which | was very grateful for. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">We had no tuition. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">American Joint provided this. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And then we received food, they provide food for us too. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So we were like a little Kubbutz (ph), student group, living and doing nothing but study so we were not hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And that's, slowly we got ourselves kind of use to the new surroundings, new people. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">We met some friends who were there before us from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Some of them Viennese Jewish students, one. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">We were very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I'm sure we're much closer now than if this would have happened before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Because we have something in common, we're all Jews and we all lost somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">There was not one person who was not victimized by loosing his family or part of his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="177"><span class="BUILDING">Felix Horn 11</span> [Date not labeled] Page 11
QUESTION:  Let me just ask you did people in that situation you're in, with people with that background, did you all talk about, did you compare experiences much? </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Talk about what had happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">| think our experiences were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Everybody had a different story to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And, someone came from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , some had survived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , some students survived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and they were beaten and so they were persecuted, but they survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And someone survived in their families even, like a sister or two brothers or one parent survived, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="184">But always someone had somebody that he lost, he or she lost, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But we had common ground because we belonged to the same group of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We were Jews, we are students, but we got there different ways, by different routes, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And everybody had their own stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">We sit at night and talk and talk and talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And everybody was not fascinated because this was a tragic story to be fascinated with, but it proved the just human will to survive and the question was, how did you survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Until today | ask myself the same question, how did | survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="191">| don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">There was nothing that you are smart, that you knew what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">If you turn left it was you're death but | didn't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">You turn right, you survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">If you walked out during the day no one stopped you. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">At night, they shoot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">So it's hard to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Is that fate?

would change his political views too. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">It was a different theatre after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">| mean, you cannot fight for certain

</span><span class="sentence" id="1103">They have lists of many people, they survived camps and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">Why don't you do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">My wife did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">Never got a response. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">The man who runs this is an American boy who runs a certain foundation, | think the name is Linder (ph) Foundation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">Who send a list of survivors in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that we know he went to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">And his name, Arian name, not real name, Arian name, is listed as survivor of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">This list is from dates from 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">The year of birth is the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">But the day and month is not clear, that's a copy of a copy of a copy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">We cannot decode the day and the month, but 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">His name was Roman Kolvolski (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">So we wrote, we put everything in motion right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">We wrote to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">We wrote to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">We wrote to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to what they call the villa-goot-mach-home (ph), in case he survived he might be collecting rent from German government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">So we wrote to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Avrasham</span> (ph), wrote to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , different <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">The Israeli Historical Documentation Office who's Director is a friend of mine from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">And when | wrote him about the whole situation, he put every motion he could, the <span class="BUILDING">German Consulate</span> is a personal friend, so he is very much assisting him in trying to, Red Felix Horn 49 [Date not labeled] Page 49 Cross, International Cross, , you name it, everything that's known to maybe get some help from, we wrote to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">As a matter of fact we just dedicated a plague for my parents in our <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">My parents, my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">And we are already reserving a plague for her parents, her brother, when this come about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">So | eliminated his name from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">We only sent for her parents, we know they perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And we still hope maybe we'll find him, but it is a very difficult part now, how to find him?

</span><span class="sentence" id="1142">So all the notes that Felix Horn 50 [Date not labeled] Page 50 were left in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in the different <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> and so on, | understand they were destroyed by the Communists, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">So nobody will find out that, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1144">QUESTION:  How long ago was it that you saw this list with his name on it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">Was it this year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1146">ANSWER:  It was about one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">We see each other quite often now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">The twin brother of the young lady?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1149">QUESTION:  Yeah, but you saw this list that showed the brother's name on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">How long ago was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1151">ANSWER:  Oh, he mailed to us from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> recently, about a month ago or so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1152">QUESTION:  Oh, just a month ago?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1153">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">And we started everything about a month ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">And my son, through the Internet, he's a computer wizard, found some 11 people from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And we've called them long distance, some are from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , some from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annapolis</span> , some are from <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> , but they never knew him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">They did not know him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">They were older people, he was a little boy at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">But it's obvious he survived because his name appear as a registered person in 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">Unless, by sheer coincidence, the same first name, last name, Roman Kolvolski (ph) is identical with his false papers were, not false, they were real papers, but on an Arian name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">We got it through the Polish underground, for a young boy who died and they never recorded a death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">So the birth certificate could be used again by Polish Felix Horn 51 [Date not labeled] Page 51 underground to save people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">That's how we got the birth certificate, from my wife's little brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">So it's possible that someone else had the same first name, last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">The same year of birth? </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">That would be such a coincidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">So we firmly believe that he's alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">Or he was alive anyway, we have to find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">So we do the best we can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">We just got a letter from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , our friend who puts ads in newspapers, and the Jewish organization there, and so far nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">So, so far we see no answers to it yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">But we're not losing hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1173">QUESTION:  So that was just a month ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">After all this time, all these years, | mean it must make you feel a lot of emotions | would imagine?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1175">ANSWER:  No question about it, no question about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">We don't give up hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">We live with hope all our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">That's what brought us where we are right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">If not hope, of course, probably would take a gun and shoot myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">Why everybody was being killed, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1181">QUESTION:  Does it make you feel any regret or sadness that maybe he was around all this time? </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">You just didn't know it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1183">ANSWER:  Yes, guilt feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">| feel very guilty, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">| feel guilty that, but searching my mind, logically thinking, | don't know what | could have done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">We did leave traces of our life, our names, where we are going to be, where we are and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">And that's all we could have done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">My wife found her Uncle by accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">One of our students Felix Horn 52 [Date not labeled] Page 52 was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and sitting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> with somebody, they found out, oh, where are you from? </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">Oh, I'm from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">But you don't speak, you're German is with an accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">Says, yes, I'm not Viennese born. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">Said, so what <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> are you from? </span><span class="sentence" id="1194"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">Oh, I'm from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">So, you know, that talking to each other turns out one was a_ survivor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">That was our group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">So he says, what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> are you from? </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">So he told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">I'm a student. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">What <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> are the students from? </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">So he said, mentioned several <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> that, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">| had a cousin that use to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , then she live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">So the student says, what's her name, do you remember her name? </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">He didn't remember her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">So he said, I'll tell you, we only have one couple from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">Her name is, he mentioned my wife's name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">He almost fainted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">It's her cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">My wife found a cousin from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> who survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">He was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , by accident run into this student who is part of our group of students, and that's how we found out each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">And since that time, through him, my wife found out she has an Aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">He knew about the Aunt because his mother was the sister of the Aunt in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">It was very close, you understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">So my wife found out through the cousin that, he's still alive, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , of course we are in contact with him, not as much as we should maybe but we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">He's very, Felix Horn 53 [Date not labeled] Page 53 very ultra, ultra orthodox and we're not as religious so it doesn't fit his philosophy you know, but he was very helpful to us and still a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">It's her cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">I'm sure my wife would tell you more details about him in her statements, okay?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1967">ANSWER:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1968">We didn't talk about the subject since he was about 14, 15, | would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1969">He knew all about it, since that time he is quite acquainted, politically orientated with what he knows all about, he knows Holocaust, and he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1970">And my daughter was recently again with my wife in <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , so they are acquainted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1971">He does not want to discuss it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1972">He refused to talk about it because he has, he tells me, | said why don't you want to talk about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1973">l, as a victim of the system, | feel strong enough to face up, to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1974">| break down here and there if | talk about some things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1975">Mainly if | talk about my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1976">Unbelievable relationship | had with my parents, unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1977">But | think we have the same relationship, with me and my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1978">And he's said, you know Dad, I'll look at those tapes after you have passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1979">| won't touch them as long as Felix Horn 80 [Date not labeled] Page 80 you're with us, | don't want to look at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1980">| want to enjoy every minute of it, at present. </span><span class="sentence" id="1981">And all of a sudden, on his own initiative, he elected to have a father/son once a month dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1982">Father/son only. </span><span class="sentence" id="1983">Me and him going after work or some meeting, together, without his family, without my family, only me and him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1984">| think what triggered the whole thing is one of my personal friends recently passed away, also a survivor, from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , a German Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1985">And his son is my son's best friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1986">And the trauma that his friend, the son of my friend, went through made my son realize how fragile is life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1987">Don't take it for granted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1988">We're here today, and don't know how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1989">And he wanted to enjoy my presence, our presence, as long as he lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1990">He doesn't want to tarnish anything with any bad memories, anything, what will come up with the discussions and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1991">He knows the history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1992">He knows the story of our survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="1993">He has the tapes in his possession. </span><span class="sentence" id="1994">So sooner or later, he is just delaying the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1995">Although he knows the truth, but he's not ready to face up to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1996">And | am not pushing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1997">| don't know if | am right or wrong, but | think it would be wrong trying to push something that he's not ready to accept right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1998">He knows the truth, he knows that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1999">And he knows what he lost in his childhood by missing his grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="2000">Nobody came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="2001">There's no way we can replace it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2002">| miss it too. </span><span class="sentence" id="2003">More, because it was not my grandparents, | miss my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="2004">| was 17 when | lost them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2005">| was not ready for an independent life. </span><span class="sentence" id="2006">And he knows that, so he's fortunate, Felix Horn 81 [Date not labeled] Page 81 he's older. </span><span class="sentence" id="2007">He is now 43, 44. </span><span class="sentence" id="2008">He's an adult man. </span><span class="sentence" id="2009">But he doesn't want to face up to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2010">And I'm not going to disturb that kind of a status quo.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2011">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2012">You know, I've read some in the past, some books of, sort of biographies of Holocaust survivors and families. </span><span class="sentence" id="2013">And in some families the situation has resulted in some forms of tension, you know, where the children feel an extra burden towards their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="2014">And in some cases, the parents, because of all they've lost, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2015">ANSWER:  How would you explain this? </span><span class="sentence" id="2016">| mean, | am at a loss to understand that.</span></p>

id="2033">| don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2034">But my kids Felix Horn 82 [Date not labeled] Page 82 always, and my personal friends, American friends, my colleague doctor in the <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="2055">It taught me fairness, straightforwardness, honesty. </span><span class="sentence" id="2056">And direct, going right directly in front of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="2057">| never, | always believe, there's no such a thing, | was taught by my Dad, that you cannot achieve in you're life if you badly wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="2058">If you badly want to do something in you're life, be something you want to be, you have to make that effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="2059">Nobody is going to give it Felix Horn 83

class="sentence" id="2077">| mean, it's just like a sister to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2078">So we create our own families. </span><span class="sentence" id="2079">That's sort of like a spontaneous, physiological type of a reflex. </span><span class="sentence" id="2080">You don't have a family, you make your own family. </span><span class="sentence" id="2081">Many of the kids of our friends call me Uncle Felix. </span><span class="sentence" id="2082">Some call me Papa. </span><span class="sentence" id="2083">Some grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="2084">And | love it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2085">That's, my kids call my friends the same way because that's how they grew up here, because there was nobody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="2086">We create our own family. </span><span class="sentence" id="2087">Not by law, by our physiological needs. </span><span class="sentence" id="2088">And that can replace, it didn't replace really, but at least it did done something to replace our lost ones, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="2089">So many of my friends, Felix Horn 84 [Date not labeled] Page 84 American born, don't understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2090">They ask me, my colleague , he ask me, Felix, tell me, I'm American born, three or four generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="2091">Where did | go

is it? </span><span class="sentence" id="2099">Where did | go wrong? </span><span class="sentence" id="2100">What is it? </span><span class="sentence" id="2101">You came here with nothing, with nobody, no language, no family, no money, nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="2102">Look at you're kids, University graduates. </span><span class="sentence" id="2103">And, in the meantime there are a few other doctors, other Jewish doctors, also came from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and refugees and so on, look at this. </span><span class="sentence" id="2104">They are all, the kids

class="sentence" id="2107">| don't know what to tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2108">| thought fora moment maybe that's why the anti-Semitism in some <span

it appears to be a certain type of a dislike to that person. </span><span class="sentence" id="2116">And that because they are different, different because of religion, they're Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="2117">That's probably contributed to the rise of anti-Semitism, out of other factors of course, the economies and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="2118">And historically,

that's why they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2681">Because smart people would not do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2682">But that's wrong to say that. </span><span

</span><span class="sentence" id="2720">After the Second World War, after Holocaust, fifty years, seventy-five years, people forget about it and they will not like to discuss it no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="2721">And | am reaching that point now, | see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2722">Letters to the editors, | see people saying, we know, Holocaust, Holocaust, Schmol-o-caust, enough, enough, enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="2723">How much longer are you going to talk about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="2724">Well, | hate to say that, from the lower class of people, not very intelligent people, would write that kind of a letter to an editor, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="2725">But they resent, non-Jews dwell on this kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2726">And they don't want Jews to dwell on it either. </span><span class="sentence" id="2727">But they don't understand the pain inflicted by that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2728">How can you forget that?
