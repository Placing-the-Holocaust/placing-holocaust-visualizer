<p>QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  -- very strong religious education for his father -- from his father. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> pretty often, not every day, but when he wouldn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> he will put tefillin in the morning and do the prayers at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> every single morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">ANSWER:  For years, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So on the holidays we go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , all of us, I remember -- like 1t was one year -- you know, holiday I could play with the other kids for the entire day in the big <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Coming in, when the Kohanim gave their blessing of -- for the congregation, something which doesn’t happen here unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">It’s the only thing I am disappointed because the Kohanim here are not -- except for very <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox synagogues</span> are not called on high holidays to give their blessing you know, for the -- for the congregation. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So at that moment th-the prayer, even when I was small child, five, six, seven I was called in and I s- strained to hear and recognize my father’s voice because if you saw sometime the scene, the Kohanim are the front, then they say to the back, to the congregation which is behind them, and at a certain point they all turn around but they have their heads covered by the big talit -- talitim. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And their hands, which are -- are covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">QUESTION:  Yes, expla -- explain that because some people who are watching this may not understand what you’ve just done with your hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  Well, the Kohanim are supposed to give a blessing on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur on the congregation. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">They -- there is a special text which is the blessing and which they have to pronounce when they give the blessing. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">The -- they have to keep their hands in a blessing movement, and the -- the way the hand have to be kept is to keep two fingers together on each hand, tight, and separated the two, and you keep your hand this way, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">QUESTION:  [indecipherable] I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  Which is not very easy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">QUESTION:  No --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Not everybody can do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">But the Kohanim are trained to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Pll -- I can tell you how I was trained to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And he would then say the blessing and the long prayers, stay with the back of the congregation and when they have to say Ivareh’ha adonai ve’ishmereha and so on, they turn around to the congregation and say that in loud voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And this is when I was trained --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Hear it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  -- straining to recognize the voice of my father, and to tell you frankly, honestly, it still rings in my ears when I think of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  Yeah, is really -- he was really yelling, and I was able to recognize, among the chorus of the voices.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">QUESTION:  So did he teach you things at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  So, as a child before Bar Mitzvah you are not supposed to do that, but after Bar Mitzvah you are [indecipherable] you have to po -- so, as part of the -- when it came time to be prepare for the Bat Mitzvah, there were terrible times already in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , the war started, the -- there was a massacre, the pogrom of Iasi to -- in °41, and I was to be Bar Mitzvah’d in °44. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So from °42, in fact, they took -- he took -- and my mother [indecipherable] for me a Melamed to teach me at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because -- I believe we are jumping history, you know, again, but after the pogrom I couldn’t go to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> so I stayed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for a full year. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">The Melamed would come and teach me, and will teach me Hebrew and other things, but one of the things of those teaching was to keep my hand this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And this was done very simple, anything body can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Take a string and tie those two fingers together and those two fingers together --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And you separate --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  -- and then separate them. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And do that several times and you’ll end up able to --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Able to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">ANSWER:  -- to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And most people when they try, they do it this way, and they cannot, th-they tremble, and -- try it, you'll s --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right, it’s not so easy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">ANSWER:  It’s not easy, so --</p>

<p>QUESTION:  Michael.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  Yes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">QUESTION:  What sort of friends did you have when you were a ki -- and I’m -- I’m really trying to distinguish if we can, before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Did you have Jewish and non-Jewish friends, did you live in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="285">How do -- would you de-describe it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">ANSWER:  Yeah, wi -- we live in several <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , my parents never owned a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , so we had to move every two, three years for rent purpose and for other things, so I remember some of our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and you know, you ca -- friendships depend on geographical location and on space patterns, so I- [remember I had a very good friend, his name was Marcu Grunberg, in one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which I terribly missed when we moved in another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I kept looking for him years, and I found him again when I was in my 20’s or so -- looked for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So there were some friends th -- this way then, in the last <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we lived in the year before we went on refu -- or became refugees, I had some kids in the same <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , which was basically a <span class="DLF">Jewish courtyard</span> with one Romanian family, and I befriended -- befriended also the girl in that family, who was about my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So basically I had a mixed group of friends, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Most of them were Jewish, and then when I was thrown out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I resumed ler -- schooling after a year in a community, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish community school</span> , of course all my friends were Jews, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">That was my childhood, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">QUESTION:  All right, e-explain something to me, because yo-you -- you used a nomenclature that seems very typical in Europe, but not necessarily here. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">You said there were Romanians, and there were Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">QUESTION:  But you are Romanian, so why the nomenclature -- do you think this way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">ANSWER:  Because in Romanian -- rom -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> we were identified as Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">QUESTION:  Not as Romanians.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  Not as Romanian, Romanian was a second kind -- of course we were -- my father was Romanian citizens, we all were Romanian citizens, but we were the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Here in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , and you know, the American culture, you say always both, you know, Romanian Americans, or Jewish Americans, or --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  So -- but over there it was very distinct. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">So when I say Romanian, I mean non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">They could be Romanian or even Hungarian people, and others, all kinds of national -- it didn’t matter to me at that time, the exact ethnic identification, but we knew who was Jewish and who was not Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">In fact, we were reminded very often that we are Jewish by those who were not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">QUESTION:  Did -- did you experience anti-Semitism as a kid before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">ANSWER:  Yes, of course --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  You did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  -- yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  And -- and how did it manifest itself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  In all kinds of ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">In <span class="BUILDING">school</span> you are known and remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We had the very clear identifier, the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So being named Catz was from the very beginning a clear identifier to everybody, first the teachers, who knew that we are Jewish, and I’m Jewish, and many of the kids, who heard a lot of things about Jews and non-Jews in their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">It was -- no, yo-you need to understand also the background. </span><span class="sentence" id="314"><span class="COUNTRY">Moldova</span> , that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> was heavily populated by Jews, and by the turn of the century, many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">townships</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and some bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> too, had -- a majority of their population was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So the presence was massive, there was always an issue, and in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> when I lived, it was the second <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , and by that time it was almost half -- a little bit less than half of the population was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I read documents which said at a certain point in time, the beginning, turn of the century or [indecipherable] before, the Jewish population exceeded a little bit, 50 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">QUESTION:  This is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">So that made everybody conscious and clear who it is and who isn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">The heavily populated <span class="REGION">Jewish areas</span> are almost homogeneously Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Ours was not, we were a bit farther away from the massive Jewish concentration of Iasi. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But our <span class="INT_SPACE">courtyard</span> had still a majority of Jewish people, even though our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was very close to the most important chur -- <span class="BUILDING">cathedral</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Mitropolea</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mitropolea</span> , which was a very important, the most important religious place, Christian religious place. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">So this explains my reference, Joan.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="324">QUESTION:  [inaudible].</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">QUESTION:  But it must have been more comfortable in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> because there was such a complement of Jewish people, where it’s almost 50 percent, if not more at certain times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">ANSWER:  Well, you can reason this way --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Or maybe not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER:  -- the question wa -- the question is whether that was real what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">In fact, the presence of many Jews made it easier for the ideologically anti-Semites to build their entire propaganda and advocacy ag -- against Jews, that here is a population which 1s a parasitic population, which is Oppressing us -- which was not true because they just didn’t have the political power -- which absorbs our economic resources. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Which again was false because the Jews being in economic activities were the -- in fact the engine of -- of many activities and facilitating. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">They were not land owners, or maybe large land owners never Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">But they facilitated the trade between agricultural sector and the urban consumers. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And so -- so the number made it easy to mount a very strong chauvinistic, anti-Semite attitude for those who wanted to exploit that. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Not everybody bought that on the <span class="REGION">Romanian side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Some did not buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Not every single Romanian was anti-Semite, but there was a long tradition of anti-Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">The literature is replete with description of Jews in a very negative way. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">You know, the Jidan was the equivalent of Kike, and this was thrown very liberally to everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Not liberally in the positive sense, but very easily to everybody as an insult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">ANSWER:  Is -- you know, go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I mean, I know that -- the existence of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> I learned from the curses which were thrown at me as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">When I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and asked my mother, what is <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So in that time there were boys who knew that and say you don’t have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> here, and use that. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">So this accounts for the distinction.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">QUESTION:  Was this hard on you as a kid?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">ANSWER:  I-It was something which was intended as a humiliation. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And when you are a child and you are cursed, everything which is accepted as a curse 1s -- becomes a curse. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">So yes, you were -- you were -- you felt very bad, and insulted and all of a sudden kind of sad that’s you are -- you are something totally different and base. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">That was, again, in the context of literature which described Jews often as -- as evil. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">There is now a book, a very interesting book, written by a -- somebody in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , a Sociologist who is Jewish [indecipherable], “The Image of the Jew in the Romanian Culture.” </span><span class="sentence" id="352">The book is that thick.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="697">ANSWER:  Yeah, we did see corpses on the <span class="DLF">street</span> here and there, kind of people who obviously didn’t move, dead or -- or mortally wounded, who knew, were -- we -- er -- people in the column were beaten, I mean they were forcibly marched, screamed at. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">People screamed from the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> who were not in the columns, [indecipherable] the inhabitants, insults and so on, and were moved there, and whoever was old was pushed, and you know, there -- the rifle, the butt of the rifle pushed and -- and hurried to advance faster. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">As a -- and we were shepherded toward the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the police in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">As we approached that -- that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we noticed there were columns coming from different other directions, cause you had to pass a -- a square, a big square and that was on the other side of the square. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">So we -- really that happened from all <span class="NPIP">parts</span> , and there were -- so the <span class="DLF">streets</span> were full with columns. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">There was a -- a -- a lot of people, a crowd was on front of the big <span class="DLF">gate</span> of the -- which was a big metal gate, a wooden gate, but closed, you couldn’t see inside the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , but part of the <span class="DLF">gate</span> <span class="DLF">metal gate</span> , a <span class="DLF">wooden gate</span> , but closed, you couldn’t see inside the courtyard, but part of the gate was opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">So when we were brought in, our turn came, then they will be the triage, the selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">They kept all the men and the grown up boys, and sent women back with children. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And as we arrived there, they pulled my father in, and they waved us all back. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I was at that time, in °41, was -- was I --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  10.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">ANSWER:  -- nine and a half -- yes 10, almost 10, but I was a small kid at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Now I am taller, but I started to gr -- grow after 13, I had a tonsils operate and started to grow fast, but as a child I was a very small child, so at 10 I was still small. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Other children, I mean boys of 13 - 14 - 15, some were sent back, some were kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Then my father disappeared through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="711">I -- we didn’t see what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Later -- later I -- I learned what happened to him, and we were sent back. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">At that time my father passed my brother to my mother, and we were hurrying back. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">The coming back, in small groups not in column, was a real scare, enormous scare, and hellish because we were not in a column, only a small group. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Everybody who was not Jewish knew what happened, and so, and there were people beating my mother, and my grandmother, who was with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And my mother would -- would embrace Zolly, my brothers, and screaming all the time, copilul, copilul, please, we’re all c-copilul, protecting him. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And I started to protect him too. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And my hands was -- were beaten by, you know, the -- you -- sticks, and --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">ANSWER:  -- and -- and we are running and my poor grandmother was running with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">So we made it almost -- so this was really -- there -- by that time there were more corpses, I remember seeing more corpses laying on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and blood here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And as we came close to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , another gang of people stopped us all and collected us again, and said, “Wo -- how do you go? </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Where do you go, <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="723">No, no, no, you should go to the police.” </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And -- and stopped and started to collect all the people who were coming back, who were only women and children, or elderly people, not men, including some other people from our <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">A family called Zilberman, with two girls older than I, Lidia and Mia, whom I knew very well, but they also stopped there [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And then the women started to beg and to pray, say, “We were at the police, please allow us to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="727">They released us from the police.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="728">No, no, no, you are lying, you are escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">We’ll shoot you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="730">So they -- they made like they were about to shoot people, say, “You stand to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> .’ </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And then somebody came and say, “Leave them, let them go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And all of a sudden they were let go. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">We were already close to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so we ran <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And that happened to the family, that Zilberman family, and that other, but with all the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">In our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , in our <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> there was another family, Barad, who was also a -- a merchant, and with a family lived there, and they had three sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And it was only the lady who was released, and the two smaller sons, children. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">The father and the elderly son was retained, like my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Well, what happened -- and I learned later, to my father, to everybody who was pulled there, was that they had to move through a -- I would say the gauntlet of people, you know, two rows of people, soldiers, policemens, [indecipherable] people with iron bars, with rubber truncheons, simply beat them with rifles, beat them bloody, then stepped on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And they were forced to -- to pass through that, and to run, and move, move, move, while beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Some fell, were trampled, others were hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">My father were -- was badly hit, and they ran, and in the back of the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , thousands of people were already gathered. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">So they gathered the crowd. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">That I learned later. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">At <span class="BUILDING">home</span> my mother was scared and concerned to death and said, “What will happen to Tata?” </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And what they believed, they are still very naive, is that they are rounding up the Jews to send them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> as labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And she said, “But he left with nothing, I mean, with the clothes on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Let me make something and see what I,” -- she was, as I told you, she was extraordinarily -- very courageous. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">She got in front of the mirror, dress herself with her best clothes [indecipherable | everything, put lipstick -- she was very pretty woman -- to look as elegant as possible, not Jewish at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Made the bundle, a little -- with a -- with shirt, with a -- some -- some towels, soap, some medication, maybe a little package, to take and get to the police to be able to pass on to her husband so he has something where he is deported to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , because he didn’t have a shirt, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And prepare them, you know, we are afraid and my grandmother say don’t go, her mother say don’t go, don’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">She would say, “No, I have to go, I have to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Nobody will recognize me, I will try to do, you know, and if then they will beat me, they will send me back, they retain only -- but I have to go, I cannot leave him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And she was just about to go when my father appeared to the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Bloodied, beaten, but appeared at the <span class="DLF">door</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="755">What happened there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="756">QUESTION:  Well, I think we have -- let’s wait til the next tape, and you’ll tell us what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">ANSWER:  Yeah, okay, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">QUESTION:  Cause we’re right at the end of this tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">End of Tape Three Beginning Tape Four</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Michael, I’m sorry about the interruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="760">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="761">QUESTION:  We were -- we ended where your f -- your mother was going to try and go see your father and give him something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="762">ANSWER:  Yes, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="763">QUESTION:  But sh -- he came back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="764">ANSWER:  Yeah, she was ready with a little package, and bundle to -- to take, and he came back and -- beaten, full of blood here and limping. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And he make -- and he kind of fell into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and push her back, and say, “Stay, stay, don’t go.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="766">Wh-What is happening?” </span><span class="sentence" id="767">He was shocked to see her so elegantly dressed, but she -- what happened at the police, the police had a big <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , but as time passed, I mean, they start in effect the rounding up of Jews not only the 29", but on the 28" in the evening, as I learned later -- we had no way of knowing, but later I learned that in fact on the 28" of th-the -- the -- of June, they also killed a lot of people in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and in their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="768">In the 29" in the morning they were surrounding, and also killing, but 0 -- occasionally killing, mostly bringing them to the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">So as they brought column after column and -- and selected only the men, even the men were too many for the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="770">So the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> became full brim -- full to the brim, they couldn’t push any more people in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">So people -- the column kept going -- they accumulated in front of the -- so something happened that they brought -- my father described that exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">They pushed some -- brought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> and two Romanians officers, with a paper and a stamp, and making a list, and s -- started to call people come. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And whoever was in the front row started to move one by one. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Say name, address and giving them a piece of paper, take it, with a stamp, that say he can go. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Lieber, it was written in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And that gave them the permission to go out of the -- so, going out was another difficult moment, they had to run because again were the beaters there. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And people started to be freed from the -- the police to create <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for others to enter. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And that apparently lasted for some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">My father saw that, he tried to be in the front, push himself, ran [indecipherable] and was beaten down and got up and got -- he was on the side come -- as I said, you know, and finally he got the <span class="DLF">line</span> to go and got the thing and came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">This is very relevant because as we also learned later from other people and the survivors, after awhile of giving those tickets to many people, not just to a few, to many, creating room, some German officers appeared there. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">They had a discussion with the Romanian officer, and they stopped giving out those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">From that moment they wouldn’t give any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Those who got it, got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">That accredited idea, that those who got the ticket and gave the address were kind of hereby enlisted for the future collection for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , or maybe they thought of deporting them, who knows? </span><span class="sentence" id="785">But -- but the others who are -- in the meantime, the day was over, s -- dark started to -- to come down, and the columns stopped too. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And that -- that I haven’t seen, but I know from the stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And my father was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , this is how my father was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="788">I am telling my family story, not what happened, but I explain how he got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="789">So when he got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , my mother told him and they understood immediately, they said, “You have to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Yo -- they have your name, address, they can come after you. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">You have to hide.” </span><span class="sentence" id="792">My mother remained -- undressed, dressed again normally. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And next to our ho-house in that big <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> was a kind of -- the <span class="REGION">land</span> <span class="BUILDING">ho-house</span> in that big courtyard was a kind of -- the land, I cannot say the word in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">In <span class="COUNTRY">Romanian</span> it’s a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ripa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="795">It’s a kind of little valley with some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">stream</span> and a little small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> , I mean [indecipherable] in the bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And that little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> had kind of this undulation going down, with a -- we used always in winter that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> this way to put our -- how do you call that? </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Sleighs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="798">QUESTION:  Sleighs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="799">ANSWER:  Sleighs, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And to go down, and every time we go here, jump, and they caught, you know, lots of speed and it was fun and the whole thing was to get down in high speed and to avoid the little water, the little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> where the -- otherwise you fall on your face.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="801">QUESTION:  [inaudible]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  And it was -- this is what I -- I learned my mastery 1n conducting the sleighs. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And it was very fun, and in the winter there was nothing but this -- this tops from the corn which was growing. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">In summer, however, that was all cultivated, it was fertile land, with corn. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">So the corn in June was already tall. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">So where could my father fall -- the -- my mother made some food for him, a piece of clothes to lay on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , and he immediately disappeared into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">corn</span> , because the corn tall, you know, and big and -- and have a -- and disappeared and didn’t see anything, and stayed there, hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And we were in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Indeed the nay -- night came, my father didn’t come back, he was hidden there, and sure enough during the night, we hear again beatings. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">I don’t know whether my mother slept or not, I sure did. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And we heard heavy beatings, and then screams, th-the <span class="DLF">door</span> was already kind of barricaded and strong, but we were afraid, we couldn’t resist, so immediately my mother called us. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">We were dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">We were asleep, but I was dressed, and my brother was dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And again my -- my grandmother was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , but the other was mobile. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And while they were beating in the <span class="DLF">front door</span> , we exited through the <span class="DLF">back door</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="814">QUESTION:  Oh, when you say beating, you mean they were hitting the front --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Hitting, yes, sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="815">QUESTION:  -- hitting the <span class="DLF">front door</span> , uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="816">ANSWER:  La -- ra -- yeah, beating the <span class="DLF">door</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="817">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="818">ANSWER:  Beating the <span class="DLF">door</span> at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="819">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="820">ANSWER:  Trying to enter, and we heard immediately there were a big noise and they were beating the <span class="DLF">door</span> , hitting the <span class="DLF">door</span> and screaming, open, open, open. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">So we immediately -- what is? </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And we went down to the back of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which also had a <span class="DLF">door</span> , looked [indecipherable] looked, nobody was there out of the group of the front, so we ran away through the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And we ran to the back of the <span class="DLF">yard</span> where there was that single Romanian family in the -- in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , who was Mihaescu, Mihaescu -- Mihaescu something. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">When I had my playmate, that girl, Coca. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">They were not very friendly with my mother and my father, generally speaking, not very pleasant, but they sheltered us. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">So they were a bit -- you know, now they’d be really rewarded for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">But they received us and we hid there. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And we wouldn’t know what happened in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="829">We were sure that my father hears the noise, because if -- he was in the corn, but not far, and hope he will not come out and they will not find him. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And we stayed the whole morning, and in the morning my mother went first -- sent the neighbor and then went first, and found indeed the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- the -- the <span class="DLF">front door</span> was badly damaged, but they didn’t break in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="831">QUESTION:  Oh, they didn’t?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="832">ANSWER:  They didn’t break in and the -- they found the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And then, slowly, we came back, and then my mother went onto the corn with more food to find my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And she found him, with Marcu, Marcu, you know, s-slowly, she [indecipherable] found him, he heard all -- sh -- he was very happy hearing that everybody is fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">He kind of understood because those people could be overheard as they spoke, and -- and cursed, you know, that they didn’t catch us. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">He imagine what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">In short, he stayed there for three days and three nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And my mother would go and bring him food and water and come back, and he would not come back into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for the fear that they will come again and -- and pick up the men, or the people, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">So he slept on- on the -- the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> because of cour -- and on the fourth day he first came o -- in the meantime we started to learn through voices and people that a lot of people didn’t come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">In our <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> some came back, but others didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">In the family Barad, which I believe I mentioned, only the woman with two children came back, the man was -- and he didn’t ex -- ec -- access the- the point to where they got the ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">And I learned that a lot of people were killed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">courtyard</span> of the police, and that others were taken to -- to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Again, I didn’t know what happened, train station made it plausible that they were taken to some labor camp somewhere, to be -- as it turned out later, it was not a labor camp, but the -- the -- the si-situation a bit calmed in the sense that there were not gangs of people roaming the s -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> made it plausible that they were taken to some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> somewhere, to be -- as it turned out later, it was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , but the -- the -- the si-situation a bit calmed in the sense that there were not gangs of people roaming the s -- the town to pull out the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">There were other things on their agenda because the war was already in the 10’s or 12’s or 13 days, you know, and the army broke through the Russian row -- armies -- and advanced, and all the news were very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">The newspapers said, you know, the victory of that, and -- and it appeared that the interest in the Romanian Jews faded for the moment, it was felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">My father came, stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , didn’t go out for months, weeks, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Kept me in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , everybody stay, we -- the -- they exchanged food between neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">It was very, very little food; water we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And this is how we passed the time after the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Then, only later on, we started news to percolate, or at least for me to learn that in the -- what happened, that people were put in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And these were the famous death trains of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">death trains</span> of Iasi, which became, you know, the equivalent of Nazi chambers on the wheels. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">There were box cars stuffed with Jews to the brim, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> stuffed with Jews to the brim, cars which normally couldn’t take anything else but -- but, you know, bags and sacks and - and freight. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">People were like sardines in a box, 150 - 200, I don’t know, but it was full. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> were filled, and then they sealed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> so the <span class="DLF">doors</span> cannot be opened, and there is no <span class="DLF">air</span> , and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started to move and to go in a direction nobody was told. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">But in fact, they didn’t go anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">It was moving between <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="857">If you ask me why it was moving, I don’t know whether they didn’t know where to go or whether one pulled -- I mean the -- the -- th-the -- there were soldiers on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> guarding those things, or whether they intentionally did that back and forth to kill the people in the [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">But with no food, with no water, people started to scream and -- and die, in fact, and -- and were horrible scenes which were told by the survivors after several days, six or seven days, one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> reached a far away point, after shuttling far away, but a point which could have re -- be reached in several normal hours of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and only a few of the people still were alive and were taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Another, second <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , was in fact never moved farther away, they were shuttling between very close <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="860">No, because it was -- people were screaming all the time, and they were stopping in <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> , the soldiers wanted to stop to do their things, they also realized that people dead -- there were dead people, an-and they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and asked the people from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> to throw out people who were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And they brought and throw them on the <span class="DLF">pavement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And they -- the -- those who were all right were not allowed to -- to come out, wa -- and they left on the <span class="DLF">pavement</span> , sealed the <span class="DLF">doors</span> again and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> left. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Those who were there -- in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> there were some Jews in those little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="864">Not in all, because before the war, the Jews from the smallest <span class="NPIP">places</span> were forcibly relocated in the bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="865">Was a political design in -- in fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">But this what happened, nobody knew at that time why. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">But 1n some smallest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> there were some Jews who were not on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and who were summoned to collect those people, and to bring them in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="868">In other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , they were simply loaded on horse drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> and dumped in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Were some interesting scenes because as a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> like that, screaming, comes and stays, and people hear of that, and some of the locals came too. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Some cursed, some others tried to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And there are -- there are records made by the survivors who testified that some of those who came really wanted to help, and to give them water. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">Some traded the water and the people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> gave them rings, and gold, and whatever they had on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Others simply grabbed and give them. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">One -- I remember that one of those who was reported doing so was recognized by Yad Vashem as among the Righteous of the People. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">And her name is there, and he’s -- she’s very much revered -- revered. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Victoria Agarici is her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">She is being described by the survivors by setting the gendarme aside. “</span><span class="sentence" id="878">I don’t care about you, I need to give water and bread to those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Beat me if you want.” </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And she broke through the rows and approached the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and gave people water. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">I mean, it’s a very emotional, but this is the story, and she saved probably the lives of some of those people who were -- you know, people drank the urine of other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">There was a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the wooden -- in the board, they would struggle among themselves who could put his mouth on that <span class="DLF">hole</span> to breathe some fresh air from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="883">So horrible Danté-esque scenes <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And here was a good, honest woman, was willing to fight the police to do what she felt was right, and to give the food and to save other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">So this is what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">This is how so -- the m -- the majority of the people who were put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> died on the tra -- either died on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , or came out at the arrival point of the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and died in the next several hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And their numbers, which probably the Holocaust Museum has, about how many exactly survived, and how many died, because statistics were kept, all -- all those by -- by the killers, and they reported so many corpses, which were [indecipherable] in fact, there is a report which was discovered in the archives of the -- the special service, security service of <span

apparently organized the massacre of the Jews, about the total number of Jews who were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">That was a report th-the pride, accomplishment and was reported by numbers, and the document exist which reports a -- a -- you know, a scary figure. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">If you can imagine that 13,100 or 200 people in total were killed in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And this was a report sent by the local unit of that special service to their superiors, as an accomplishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I couldn’t give you my own opinion, I don’t have a number, but I know how many I saw myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">But this is a total number, so they kept numbers also on the people who survived from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and people who were unloaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">But I can again say that I saw in this -- in the 90’s, when I was able again to travel to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , and I did travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">I got married in the meantime, here in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , and I took my wife, who is American, and we went through the route of the <span class="COUNTRY">Moldova</span> , and stopped in all these little t-towns until we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">t-towns</span> until we went to Iasi, where I was born and showed her, and then went further. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">She’s also an anthropologist, Ruth Cernea, very interested in the story of my family, and the story of the Jews in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="896">She’s -- her field of study is Jewish culture, and the Passover Seder, which -- she wrote books on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">No -- well -- very well known anthropologist. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And of course was interested herself in seeing what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And in those little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , coming close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> , where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped, we visit <span class="BUILDING">cemeteries</span> , and you can see huge <span class="DLF">graves</span> , <span class="DLF">collective graves</span> , in which those bodies were dumped, without any identification, nobody knows who was buried where. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">Shortly thereafter, the war, those common <span class="DLF">graves</span> covered, you know, by soil and -- and branches got, you know, stone covers, and immediate after the war, the community, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> put huge slabs of concrete. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">It’s not normal gravestone, but they are -- they are enormously impressive because you see slabs of concrete covering the collective graves of those killed in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , which are stretching from here all the way to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> there, one after the other, one after the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="902">QUESTION:  So 20 or 30 feet of --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Pardon me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">QUESTION:  20 or 30 feet of concrete.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="904">ANSWER:  There were about even more, seven, eight meters I would say, which yes, exactly 25 feet length. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">All standard cement, you know, some -- but those are the collective <span class="DLF">graves</span> , which were set immediately after the war -- I mean, the -- the -- the slabs. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And historical -- historical paradox and irony, and the sociological paradox is that those -- the <span class="DLF">graves</span> of those killed in those -- in the massacres, are in several cemeteries not far from another corner of the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , which co- contained the <span class="DLF">graves</span> of people who were killed during the first World War, and in some prior war, which was called the War of Independence, when some Jews were allowed to fight for -- in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Still distinguished as Jews, but they’re very willing to fight and proud to fight for the independence of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And then they were buried in the Jewish cemetery, where their remains were brought because they were Jews, in -- but the Jewish communities were very proud that part of their community gave their lives in the fight and in the war for <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> , where their remains were brought because they were Jews, in -- but the Jewish communities were very proud that part of their community gave their lives in the fight and in the war for Romania’s independence. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">It was a matter of honor, and the desire to make their contribution to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and identify with the right cause of independence of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> they were living. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And that corner of <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , the heroes of the independence war, and of the first war is always treasured, and kind of honored specifically. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">And next to it you can see the -- the Jews killed in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> in a massacre, in a pogrom which was the -- the premonition of what was to happen in the next year on a even larger scale to so many other hundreds and thousands of Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="912">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">ANSWER:  So this 1s -- it was -- later when we -- some of the people who remained alive, send messages where they are, and their families went and contacted, and tried to find out whether their own relatives were among the survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">One arrived in some wha -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calarasi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And another, which was farther away, another was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portleroi</span> which was closer and easier from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> to travel there. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And you know, there was an unending waiting, and when people came back, family members, and were -- got the news that their father, or their brother, or their son didn’t make it, was killed, and others was all right, no, you know, that -- you know, Sroul Abramovitch died. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">I know for sure because he died in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And the other died, and I know when his body was -- was thrown down. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">So they found -- they got the certainty of having lost those people forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">So it was a continuous awareness of that pogrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="921">QUESTION:  [indecipherable] in some way, because --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, no, I mean the -- the -- the climate the people who disappeared were first deemed alive and hopefully will return, because as I said, not only my parents, but others thought that eventually they are being transpor -- transported to some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="922">The <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was in war, the need for labor was obvious. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">It was a plausible -- maybe it was wishful thinking, but nobody could imagine that they -- people, live people are being put in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and shuffled from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other, without food and wa -- to be killed, or be killed in -- s -- but this happened, so awareness seeped in more and more, and the tragedy, and the crying and th-the suffering and the fear was -- were prevailing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="924">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="925">ANSWER:  So it was very hard months and years, and my parents kept me the entire year, inside the -- the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and would not allow me to go except in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> under supervision, to know all the time what happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">No going out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And I was not the only child treated this way by their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">So, it was a time of hard oppression, of fear for the -- in the entire community. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And the awareness of -- of the loss, and of the massacre, which nobody would have conceived that. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">You know, there -- that was not actually the first in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , there were pogroms before, in ’97 -- 1907, some Jews were killed, there were riots in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> [indecipherable] killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">There was a small pogrom in 1940, apparently done by the military, which some people learned about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">I did not know about that at that time, I was a kid, but it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorohoi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="933">A number of Jews, two or 300 were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">I read about it later. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">My parents could have known that it happened in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">We all knew, however -- I also knew tha -- about what happened in January in ’41 before <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> entered the war, when there was the -- not the riot but the attempt to a coup -- coup d’etat that -- the coup by the Iron Guard to grab power, and Antonescu was the leader, use the army to -- to squelch that -- that attempt to grab the power, an- and defeated the Iron Guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">But during the Iron Guard upraising and attempt, they killed Jews, and they killed also Romanian police or Romanian soldiers who fought them. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">When they took the Romanian soldiers, which were Romanian, they would still kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">But for the Jews, there was a special treatment. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">They took the Jews whom they caught, brought them to the <span class="BUILDING">town slaughterhouse</span> , killed them, and hang their bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And the newspapers carried pictures of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">The reason the newspapers carried pictures was bay -- because the newspapers of Antonescu, who fought the Iron Guard, was interested to show what the Iron Guard was doing, killing Romanians, and also those jidan, you know, th-the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And look what they did, they were savages and --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  I'm afraid we have to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">End of Tape Four Beginning Tape Five</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Michael, can you give us some sense of what that year of being in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> pretty much -- I mean, I know you went into the courtyard, but you were not a free kid any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="946">ANSWER:  No, no, well it was a very hard year. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">It was a general year of -- of -- a sense of impending doom. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">After all we heard that ha-happened, the fear was pervasive in our bones, it could re- happen again every -- every day in fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">We were seeing that the presence of the army was less, and there was apparent quiet, but the <span class="BUILDING">rumor mill</span> and the fears, the -- the -- the sense that, you know, we have no -- no -- no protection whatever, you can -- absolutely -- are absolutely at the mercy of anything anybody wanted to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And there was now and then, news coming about somebody was beaten, somebody was -- you know, in the open day, everything was stolen from him, and beaten and left there in full day -- full daylight. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">And police didn’t say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">So, the sense was that you were under siege all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="953">QUESTION:  Were you conscious of this as a 10 year old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="954">ANSWER:  Yeah, I wasn’t -- I was, beca -- you know, I did have at that time, 10 - 11 years, but those events make you more mature than your age, and your fear makes you sensitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">No, th -- and real things happened, it was not simply a -- an anonymous or kind of general unexplained fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">My father for instance, and other Jews, received a paper which was called Call Order. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Was a military paper from the military service saying -- and this was tha -- six months we -- after the -- the massacre, in beginning of ’42. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">They say, hereby you are informed that you are to deliver to -- to work as labor -- forced labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">You are part of a team number 38, or some number, under the team leader is so and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">This is the place where you have to be present when called. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">The calls will be made publicly, by public speakers and other ways, and you immediately have to present yourself at that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , under severe penalties. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">Signed, the military circle of Iasi. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">So we received that, and that document I -- I remember was the -- the scariest of all. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">So finally they said they are coming now around to put out all the Jews, to round them up and to send, and this is even official, and not unan -- announced. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">And with -- make -- happen all the day because there 1s no today. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">And so you lived in fear that that order would be executed any time, and would not know what would happen to -- to him, or to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And sure enough, shortly thereafter that order came another one asking him to -- to come to be present for forced labor at the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , which was the address of the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Now this was a <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> from where the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">death trains</span> were sent out. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And here is a paper asking him to come there and -- and work, so you can imagine what he thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">Will he ever come back, or are they all rounding them up there under some kind of order, pretext, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">They will load them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and here it will happen again, they will be killed, taken away, you will never see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">On the other hand, he couldn’t not go. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">How could he not go, because it was obvious they had his name and his address and in full. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">So, with all the fear in your heart, and other people also received, so it was a collective -- and the rumor mill k- kept going, did you receive, did you receive, I did receive, I didn’t receive, why didn’t that receive, what will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">So on the appointed day, he was all dressed, equipped with heavier because it was a cold winter, with a package, you know, to last him, and he was summoned and he had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="976">At the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> they were all put to shovel snow, and clean that and clean that, and we were waiting, waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And it was the explosion of joy when at the end of the day we saw him back. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">We didn’t know whether he will come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And he worked there for I don’t know how many, a -- a week, or [indecipherable] and he came back every day, and others came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">They did not send those -- them again or kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">Was hard work, forced labor, but they all came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">But with the indication that they can be called again any time. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">So if- we all lived in expectation of another call, so the -- the sense of fear, the terror, the impending risks or -- were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">And he was called indeed, but he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Interesting enough, the par -- the bureaucracy works in all system. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">He received a document that he did present himself to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and he did the days of labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">And I have the documents of, you know, the call order, and the confirmation that he was present and did the hard labor, signed by the military, you know, department, with the dates exactly what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">So that was the year -- oh, yes, I was saying about all the Jews, there was, at the end of spring, the -- the -- the news came that all the Jews will have to be submitted to a census, the entire Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">And that should be done through the Jewish community, the Jewish community was responsible that -- that all the Jews be recorded. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">Now, we knew that the Jewish community knew who the Jews are and where they are, so why is there all of a sudden need to do again such a thing? </span><span class="sentence" id="991">Again, th -- all the inferences and the fears. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">It was just short of a year from the pogrom, from the massacre in May, June. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And it was announced and we lived in fear and then there were cards sent for each to fill in, because it was a census to be filled in. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">Indeed, the community was asked to do, to submit to the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">We didn’t hear the community, we fer -- we feared what was going to happen, and everybody had to receive, old, young, child, no matter, so we fe -- I -- I filled the card of that census myself, as the original document, which was titled, you know, census of all inhabitants with Jewish blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">Recensamintul locuitor cu

<p>QUESTION:  And this is the Romanian government [indecipherable] this is not Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="998">ANSWER:  This is the Romanian government, no, no, no, this is absolutely the Romanian government, and -- and it was [indecipherable] my name, my age, my <span class="NPIP">place</span> of -- my address, my everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">And because I was a minor, my father was -- had -- there was a place to record that -- his signature, to guarantee for the accuracy of the data. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">So I was also on the record as a inhabitant with Jewish blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">You know, available for pick up, if needed.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1007">ANSWER:  Including my little brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">Everybody with Jewish blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">He may have his own card, because my -- my father and my mother saved that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">I have mine from my -- through my mother and I don’t know that he has it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">But it is, it has all the stamps on the four -- front, on the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">It’s a document, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">Maybe sometime I’ Il donate it to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , because it [indecipherable] a document. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">So you may realize from those moments which I try to reconstruct, the -- the climate in which we lived, and how everything like that was like a -- a jolt of fear and you know, shaking us up and throwing us back into fear and uncertainty and th-the sense of constant siege, and a risk of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">You know, I told you when I came -- I was near execution on the way back from the police quarters when they caught us, stopped us and put us with the face to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">police quarters</span> when they caught us, stopped us and put us with the face to the wall. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And they said, you escaped, you will -- going to be killed, until that voice sounded, let them go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">But it was impending execution to be with your face -- so you don’t forget easily such things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">So that was what we felt at the time and how the year went, and --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Just -- was your sleep disordered? </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">I mean, during that year when you were in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and clearly by then you know that things are extremely tense and something horrible can happen at any moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">Do you have nightmares? </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">Do you -- I mean are you still this -- a kid whose -- and you --</p>

<p>QUESTION:  What is a shtender?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1126">ANSWER:  The shtender 1s the -- the piece of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> on which you keep your -- your Sidur, to read when there is an individual <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">Otherwise there is a full <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">A lot of times there is, you know, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> , and the shtender at a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">Here we were given the shtenders to be able to use the boxes to put our copy books -- prayer books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">It wasn’t proper equipment for children, that was made for ad-adults, but I remember very well how we learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">We had teachers and we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">We had breaks, you know, we played in the breaks and a bit of normalcy seeped in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">And this was end of ’42 - ’43, and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> happened, and then we became happy, and the Romanians, and the others people there started to understand that the war is turning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And since [indecipherable] and casualties were on the <span class="REGION">Romanian side</span> pretty severe -- very severe in fact, because the Germans put always the Romanian troops and regiments in the -- in the fire, you know, in the most dangerous, and there were many casualties and losses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">So the situation turned generally grim, but we were able to -- to learn about what is happening, and some hope started to- to come up, that the Germans are going to be defeated, and the war is going to be turned around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">So that gave us a bit of hope, our hope grew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">The situation generally didn’t worsen, and it didn’t worsen for Jews as it was -- became apparent much later, I did not have any way myself to learn that, but for the overall picture it appeared that the politicians, including the government, Antonescu, realized sooner than we did that the war is turning and then the risk of being -- killing the Jews is 10 times as high because they may be a -- become accountable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">So the -- the state’s anti-Semite activities did not grow, or did not expand their -- I am not aware of any other massacre or pogrom, or further very severe -- I don’t recall my father being called again in ’43 to- to do forced labor and now I understand, I mean there are documents which show that the -- the government wanted to -- to change course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">They send also representatives on the sly to contact the allies, without <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> knowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And that was ’43, in °44 <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> turned sides already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">So for us the situation was better on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">Still fear, still Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">We had an episode of wearing the yellow star in the period of ’41, I don’t recall in -- exactly how long, but I still have the yellow star and -- two yellow stars, in fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">One was also exhibited in New York, and -- which were mine, my -- my mother kept that too, which were sewn on garments when we had to go out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and -- which were mine, my -- my mother kept that too, which were sewn on garments when we had to go out of the house, and stayed on the garments except that if we had to change the garments, we had to move those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">So there was -- that situation of living between how do you I say it, one fear and the other, and one hope and another hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">Until -- but then, you know, the -- the sense of hope and the sense of possible escape started to soon -- rather s-soon to disappear again because the Russians were successful in pushing the Germans and the Romanian armies back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">And that increased the -- for us, th-the sense of fear that if they are defeated, and if they are going to retreat, we can be again in great jeopardy, and another massacre may occur when the armies will be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">That was one -- one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">The other thing which happened in that -

<p><span class="sentence" id="1206">ANSWER:  -- to the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">And they stayed in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and then moved further and pushed further and pushed further. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">All the time no transportation offered, no -- no help to people who are old or sick or incapable of doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">Lots of them perished on those marches, you know, they weren’t given horses, the soldiers have the horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">And until they stayed in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for awhile, they had to beg their food, they are receiving very little, beg their food from the peasants around them, steal the food from the <span class="DLF">field</span> , eat whatever they could find on the <span class="DLF">field</span> , potatoes, raw potatoes and any other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">And he found them -- and then were stayed in <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> emptied by people who went when the Russian army retreated, they -- many people evacuated with -- together with the Russian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">And those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were not in the system of the German camps, you know, the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German camps</span> , you know, the barracks were well organized German style, were simply improvised, the same way like the -- you know, the -- the -- the killing of the Jews in the pogrom, which I already told you, was a very artisanal killing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1213">QUESTION:  It was a very”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1214">ANSWER:  Artisanal killing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1215">QUESTION:  Artisanal, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1216">ANSWER:  I mean, in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">death trains</span> , you know, hacking them to death, it was not the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , the type of thing, the horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">And maybe the fact that, you know, the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> are so well known is not due only to the huge numbers but to the industrialized manner of killing Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">Here it was more the traditional manner was used, you know, kill directly, or the innovation was putting them on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">But 1-in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were -- do the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">They were herded to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , compelled to work, or left abandoned there, fell on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , found someplace to sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">And then in a week or two days or three days or maybe two months, when the new order came, or when the soldiers rested, they were shepherded further. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">So he came back and told us that my uncle Yosl died of starvation and -- and illness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">He was not shot, but he caught typhus and -- and he died in the arms of his sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">That the -- his wife is alive, Surka, Aunt Surka. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">Who was, as it happened in a Jewish family, she was also the youngest sister of my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">So the grandmother, my grandmother married as a second wife, her husband, who had sons from the first wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">Some of the sons were much older than [indecipherable] young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">So one of them at the -- some point, married the youngest sister of my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">So the son married the sister of his father’s wife, second wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">But it was perfectly [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">And she became -- and she gave birth to four sons, who are my direct first cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And the story came that one of them, in that terrible evacuation being herded, separated from the family and was lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">As it turned out, he didn’t separate by chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">He wanted to -- to run away and to run away with the Russians and to reach the Russians and to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">And he did succeeded, went east on his own, crossed the <span class="DLF">front line</span> , reached the <span class="DLF">Russians line</span> , and became a soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">And for the entire war in the Russian army, all the way to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">Was crippled, unfortunately, and remained cripple -- shorter leg for -- but came back alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">And we are very proud of him because he wanted to fight and he fought the Nazis to -- to the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">And -- and then another one, who lived not with his father in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balti</span> was caught in an -- another thing, and also apparently left and was on the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">So to escape that war and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , the father died, the boys survived, and the mother survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">And the doctor brought us the information only about those who he fou -- he found in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> we -- at that time we didn’t know about those who fought in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">And then next time when he went, my mother gave him money, gave him a blanket, gave him medication. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">Not too much, because he couldn’t carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">He went back to the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , found them and gave them the blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">Now imagine what it means in that condition to receive something like from <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> , you -- you get, and it was -- and they never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">I met th-the cousin Zioma, one of them I mentioned, I believe before, that I met him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balti</span> years later and then he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">The youngest one, Uca, is fortunately still a-alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">He left the <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> earlier than his older brother, he came to <span

some food for people, how his father died in his hand, sick and no-not medicated by anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">The stories are horrible, but he is alive. </span><span

<p>QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1257">ANSWER:  It’s Uca Faerstein, you keep the name and so -- so th-this -- that was again a hor -- a typical event for our family, typical Holocaust event which marked our lives because we were able -- my mother was able once to send those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">But then she co -- started to collect things and prepare, in the hope that she will be able to send again and again and again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">And collected from whoever she could, that and the other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">There was no other option to send. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">But at least we knew that they were alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">And they kept hope that they will survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">So this is how we moved through °43. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">And then 44 came, and the front was coming closer to -- closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">This is when the panic started in the Jewish community again, that as the army would retreat, they were already visible retreating and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoys</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> again, that as the army would retreat, they were already visible retreating and convoys of people, very poorly looking, came through Iasi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">You know, in the early years we saw Russian prisoners brought through Iasi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">In the later years we didn’t see Russian prisoners brought through Iasi any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">We saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoys</span> of the Romanian army, or of the Germans coming in a very ragtag shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">They were visible in ’43, I remember, not ’42, but in "43 I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">And the stories was, you know, between people, telling whoever saw, communicated to the other, you know, I saw another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> , it doesn’t go good for them.

<p><span class="sentence" id="1277">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1278">ANSWER:  But I am frankly not surprised about that, Joan, to tell you the truth, because I -- I know how the massacre in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> happened, that was the largest pogrom, I mean 13,000 people in one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> is huge, is a huge -- men -- mostly men, maybe a few children and some women, so - but th-there was a veil of silence afterward, nobody talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">At that time no newspaper reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1280">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1281">ANSWER:  How would people know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">Nobody discussed, that was buried under silence [indecipherable] thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">Th-Th-The west didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">Later on, you know, if you read those things, you find out that apparently some news percolated to the U.S. embassy in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , of course still an <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> then in °41, and some allusion -- you should ask your expert in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , some reference was vague in a -- some dispatch from the U.S. consul or <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> about some events in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> <span class="BUILDING">U.S. embassy</span> in Romania, of course still an embassy then in °41, and some allusion -- you should ask your expert in the museum, some reference was vague in a -- some dispatch from the U.S. consul or embassy in Romania about some events in Iasi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">But without proper description, nobody realized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">And then the system kept it all the way secret until the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">In the war there was a process of them s -- at the end of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1288">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1289">ANSWER:  Some of the people who are caught with very little full evidence, and then when the communist system took over in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , they put another veil of silence because they didn’t want to -- <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> to be blamed for doing such things, such a massacre. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">In fact, however that massacre was o-of a magnitude unprecedented in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">Even at Kristallnacht in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , there were no 13,000 Jews killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">A lot of destruction, and a number of victims, but not 13,000 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">So that was th-the first big event on the European scale of killing Jews en masse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">Maybe in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> it happened too, in ’39 or ’40, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">But then it was repeated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> , it was repeated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">Babi Yar was a clear copycat of that, these people brought and killed in front of their <span class="DLF">trenches</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babi Yar</span> was a clear copycat of that, these people brought and killed in front of their trenches and [indecipherable] there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">But there are description from the pogrom in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> that people -- corpses were loaded on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and when <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came to a <span class="DLF">grave</span> , first they -- they carried body by body, then they become too cumbersome, and they say, you know, let’s shovel all of them at once, to fall straight into the <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">This was how it was treated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">And the -- the -- in short, there was -- what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> was huge, and yet little known. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">So therefore I’m not surprised that we didn’t receive the news from all the things which happened under the occupation in the <span class="REGION">Russian territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">We only realized through that doctor who came, when we got the story how they were pushed from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> , that they were pushed to the east to be beyond any <span class="DLF">line</span> which could presumably still remain under <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">That that <span class="REGION">territory</span> had to be clean of all the Jews, which that <span class="REGION">territory</span> which was expected to become Romanian in the event of the war ending with a German victory, should be clean of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">This is why they -- they moved them, they killed some of them, but whoever stayed alive should be on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">Which was -- which -- that is what today we call th-the proper concept, ethnic cleanstick- cleansing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">That preceded with decades the ethnic cleansing in -- by <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span> ’s -- or -- or by the Muslims in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> , and in what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> very recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">But 1t was ethnic cleansing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">This throwing an ethnic group, either by direct killing, or by starvation, or by hunger, or allowing them to be killed by epidemics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">And pushing the -- the remainders o-out beyond the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">So this is --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  When was it clear to you how big the pogrom was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">Because your own experience of the pogrom was limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">The fear was enormous, but you clearly wouldn’t have known at the end of the four days --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1314">ANSWER:  What happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">When we started to learn the story about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , we started to get more and more information and a grasp of events. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">Then the news percolated that a lot of people were killed then -- I mean, the people who saved the life, s -- told and communicated <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that we are alive, but we saw that that and that was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">The Iasi families [indecipherable] through messages, through friends, including Romanian friends, to contact those whom we ler -- who they learned are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calarasi</span> , I mean far away, to -- what happened to, you know, Avram Roitembaum, and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">And the news we -- I saw him dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1319">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1320">ANSWER:  So this -- the -- the realization of the -- of the magnitude seeped in gradually.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1322">ANSWER:  And we s -- we realized it was bigger and bigger and bigger than we could realize then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">We had it firsthand because in my <span class="INT_SPACE">courtyard</span> , two people did not return, the -- Mr. Barad and his older son. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">And the family was -- stayed Shiva when they learned about that thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">So we realized continuously th-the inc -- increasingly realized the size of the -- the numbers we only found out and learned after the war, the total numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">And as I mentioned to you during the communist system, there were no reports and le -- except the -- the trial of some of the criminals who were involved, no publicity was made. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">The Jewish community would have a commemoration of the massacre each year and they would say there were so many people killed, the -- 11,000 was the number at a certain time, which they believed it was, just huge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">Then the documents were discovered that there were -- in the special services reported more then 11,000 killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">And gradually we’d realize the size, but not when I was a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">From a child my -- my direct experience was about the reality of that happening to me, to my family, to the neighbors in the immediate --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1479">QUESTION:  You found it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1480">ANSWER:  Yes, and we found the name there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">So I know where my grandmother is buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">So this was the -- one thing about departure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">And then the other grandmother was in much better shape physically. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">And indeed, she survived until ’66 or something.</span></p>

<p>ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1851">QUESTION:  And who’s this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1852">ANSWER:  This is my grandmother, again on the mother’s side. </span><span class="sentence" id="1853">I called her Babba Brana, this is Brana Baratz Faerstein, and the little person over there is me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1854">That -- there is an inscription on the back of the picture which shows that at that age I was 11 months old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1855">But you can see that my grandmother still looked very -- was a very beautiful -- the very beautiful woman she was here, with -- with white hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1856">In the earlier pictures with my mother at that age, she had hair was still dark and black. </span><span class="sentence" id="1857">Young and beautiful and now she has -- that is what, about 30 years later, or so.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  Okay, go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1868">ANSWER:  What you can see now Is the yellow star, the famous yellow star which the Jews from several parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> were forced to wear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1869">That part included Iasi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1870">And that was the star I had, in fact, the stars were circulating in the family between me and my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1871">They had to be sewn on our garments whenever we went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1872">They -- if you use the same garment it stays the same, but if we change the garment we cannot go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> without the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="1873">So my mother saved two of our yellow stars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1874">One of them is in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish museum</span> in -- <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , this is the second and I -- I -- that was my own and my father’s, for some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1875">For --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And did you -- did you have to purchase these, or were these homemade?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1876">ANSWER:  No, no, they were handmade by each family and this is why you have also variety. </span><span class="sentence" id="1877">They were sewn in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> out of yellow fabric and black fabric.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1878">QUESTION:  And the pens are for scale?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1879">ANSWER:  And the pen is in for scale, and you can see how it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1880">In fact, we had in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machine</span> , and that was used; I remembered how it looked, and it used for garment too, cause at -- every family sew a lot of garments at that time for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1881">But it -- 1t was used to manufacture our yellow stars.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1882">QUESTION:  And what are these documents right here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1883">ANSWER:  These are documents from 1942, in the height of the Holocaust period. </span><span class="sentence" id="1884">The first one is an order which my father received from the military authority of Iasi for the commandant -- you know, the commander of the military authority, to be on call, to be ready that he is going to be called for duties, unspecified, and he should be ready any time such call will be made. </span><span class="sentence" id="1885">It will be communicated loudly and he’s bound to come to the address mentioned in the order, under sever- severe penalty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1886">It’s also indicated that he was allocated to be a member of a -- a labor team number 38, to be led by another Jewish man named Kaufman, Yuda. </span><span class="sentence" id="1887">His name was also written there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1888">The name of my father 1s up there, Marcu L from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leib</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Catz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1889">The -- the threat was terrible because it does not -- it did not specify what will happen to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1890">Other Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> received the same order, and the fear was that this is a systematic call again to -- to eliminate them, to kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1891">Indeed then it was -- became known that they have to present themselves, the specific <span class="NPIP">place</span> was the railway station, exactly the same <span class="BUILDING">station</span> <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> , exactly the same station where the Jews in the -- were put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">death train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1892">So then my father was informed that he has to be present at a certain day there, together with other Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1893">And with fear in his heart, he had to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1894">The bureac -- and he went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1895">Fortunately we saw him back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1896">But this second document 1s the certificate which the military bureaucracy handed over to him to -- as a proof that he indeed responded to the call and was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1897">That was important document too, to protect him from the accusation that he did not show up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1898">So this our family document saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1899">There were more like that, but not all were sa -- saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1900">QUESTION:  And what is this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1901">ANSWER:  This is a document about myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1902">I believe I mentioned earlier that in 1942, the <span class="COUNTRY">Romanian</span> government decided to make a full census of the Jewish population and they asked the Federation of Jewish Communities to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1903">It was called the Center Organization of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1904">Whatever the name -- Centrala Evreilor din <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1905">So again we got extremely afraid that the - the census of all Jews is being made to keep good track of where they are and who they are, when the decision will be made that they could be picked up and -- and something done not very good to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1906">So this card however, is also very important historical document because it’s -- it’s blunt, it say, this 1s a census -- Recensamintul locuitoriln cu ringelvreese. </span><span class="sentence" id="1907">The census for inhabitants having Jewish blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1908">I mean, this is -- they were not mincing words. </span><span class="sentence" id="1909">The ethnic bias is clear, blood bias. </span><span class="sentence" id="1910">You have Jewish blood, you are a different category of person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1911">The name is there, Catz, Moise, my name, our address, Iasi, street Colonel Langa, tracepervachi, which 1s 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="1912">My fa -- because I was a minor in 1942, my father and that -- June ’42 is mentioned there as the date, my father has to put his identity number on the left side of the card. </span><span class="sentence" id="1913">Now, on the back of the card, you can see two stamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="1914">One is the -- the stamps of the Iasi police, and the other one 1s -- the first one is the Iasi police with the crown of the king over there you can see in the first. </span><span class="sentence" id="1915">And the second is the stamp of the Jewish community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> , giving authenticity to this document.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1916">QUESTION:  And this document?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1917">ANSWER:  This document is something -- is a gift which I received from the Jewish community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balti</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> of Balti in 1994 where I returned to my birth -- town of birth, simply to see how it looked at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1918">I was on a World Bank mission to <span class="COUNTRY">Moldova</span> for developing programs which the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> was developing for <span class="COUNTRY">Moldova</span> , in my capacity the senior advisor at that time at the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> for social policies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1919">I also spoke the language of course, so I went on that mission, and I took a few days off from the work problem to be able to visit my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balti</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1920">At that time I wanted to see the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in which my -- my grandfather was praying in his time, but it had been destroyed long before by the war, and very little was left from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balti</span> -- from past <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balti</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1921">So I was told however that the new <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was created in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , which was built like a usual <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">dwelling</span> , but in -- it’s used as a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and was taken there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1922">And then I saw there indeed, in ’94, through the people who are living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balti</span> , the Jews living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balti</span> , in a -- in a Saturday morning, with a full service done as -- by usual service. </span><span class="sentence" id="1923">My leader, th-the person who brought me there was my cousin, first cousin, Zioma Faerstein, who was -- whom I mentioned before, who was living with his family still at that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balti</span> , in °94. </span><span class="sentence" id="1924">He took me to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and explained to me -- I -- I wanted to have some kind of memory and I asked whether I can have something from that -- they say we cannot give you any sidur, because we have very little sidurim, there are not enough, we don’t have any other items. </span><span class="sentence" id="1925">But I notice in that corner, some cardboards with some inscriptions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1926">I say, “What are these?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1927">They say, “Well, these are things which we had to write when we opened up -- came back from -- from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and there were a lot of people who died in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and those who stayed alive wanted to say Kaddish after them, pray. </span><span class="sentence" id="1928">But they didn’t know to the Kaddish, the Hebrew Kaddish words. </span><span class="sentence" id="1929">So we had to write the Hebrew Kaddish with Slavic -- with Cyrillic letters so they can pronounce, reading in Cyrillic letters, the -- the words of the Kaddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1930">At that time we wrote -- we created the black -- the cardboards, and these are some of them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1931">On the right hand corner you can see the Hebrew word from Kaddish, the dollit is missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1932">Only k-u then sheen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1933">On the left hand corner is Kaddish the same word with Cyrillic letters, and then the whole Kaddish is written in Cyrillic letter. [</span><span class="sentence" id="1934">speaks Hebrew] and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1935">And this is a prayer which Jews from all the entire world are saying in the memory of those whom they lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1936">It was very moving to me to see that -- that document, historic document improvised, a product of the Holocaust whose -- who was needed because of the Holocaust, who will -- had to be manufactured by hand because there was no prayer books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1937">And I ask whether I can have at least one of them to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1938">They said you can have them all because by now we have [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1939">And they ended up giving me three of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1940">So I brought them with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1941">One 1s this one, another one is in the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1942">The third one is with me still, waiting if your <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> , Joan, want to exhibit it, I’m happy to -- to give it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1943">It is extremely meaningful for me because it 1s from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> I was born and from the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , but I believe it’s meaningful for the entire history of what the Holocaust mean -- meant, and how people came out of the Holocaust having to cry for those whom they lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1944">QUESTION:  Okay, and this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1945">ANSWER:  This is a plaque, a memorial plaque which my mother commissioned after she arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> to -- for the memory of those in the family who died during the Holocaust and for the other people in the family who passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1946">She donated the money for planting trees in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in their memory, and then ordered this plaque and she’s -- it’s written there, this <span class="DLF">garden</span> of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> is in honor of the families Faerstein, Catz and Baratz, the families which I mentioned, made by Shanya Faerstein Catz. </span><span class="sentence" id="1947">In parenthesis, Buchika which is a nickname which the small kids a -- you know, gave to her, my kids gave to my mother, Buchika, and this is how she was left in our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1948">And on the left hand side there are the names of people who died in normal circumstances before, or maybe after the Holocaust, but not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1949">It includes my grandfather, my grandmother and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1950">Some of them were in the Holocaust, my father, including my late wife, Stella Yavetz Catz Cernea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1951">On the right hand side are the names of many of those who died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transnistria</span> , I mean in the -- in the former <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bessarabia</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balti</span> and the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> which I mentioned during my narrative. </span><span class="sentence" id="1952">All of them whom she knew as certainly having died in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> by the time she -- she ordered this plaque. </span><span class="sentence" id="1953">Subsequently she found out that others, who are not here, also passed away, but their names are not [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1954">In fact, there were more than the 25 she mentions here.</span></p>
