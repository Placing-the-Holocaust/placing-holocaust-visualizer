<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Rochelle Blackman Slivka. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> on April 18th in 1922.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  What was life like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  Well, my father worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> in the Jewish Kehilla in the social services department. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">My mother was a housewife. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">We we were growing up, my sister and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">We had nice happy family. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">We went to a <span class="BUILDING">private elementary school</span> and then we went to a Hebrew- speaking high school. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">They didn't accept too many Jews, not at all any Jews to <span class="BUILDING">public high schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">They had to go to <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span> , Yiddish-speaking, or Polish-speaking, or Hebrew-speaking schools. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My father was a Zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">He sent us to a Hebrew-speaking high school. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And life in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> for us wasn't easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">We went to different <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> from the non-Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Sometimes the non-Jewish children used to beat us up while we were going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and we had to wear different uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We were with different numbers than the non-Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">But life was not bad except the anti-Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We had a normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Our family wasn't orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">We were more conservative and I'm sorry [Pause |
QUESTION:  What about friends....?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  We had a lot of friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">We socialized a lot with [friends]...we had; My parents had a lot of friends in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and our social life was quite active in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , until the war broke out between, in 1939 between <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We we were at the time at our <span class="BUILDING">summer home</span> in outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> , but we heard that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in September Ist, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And we they bombed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , but we, with help with other relatives from other relatives, we came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and and a couple 01:04: of days later the Russians came into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The war only lasted seventeen days between <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> wasn't prepared for the war at all and at the same time <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the Soviet Union decided to divide <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in two halves. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">We were lucky enough to fall to the Russians, and when the Russians came in to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , life stabilized a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">We went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">People went back to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My father still worked at the <span class="BUILDING">Vilno Kehilla</span> and life was going on pretty normal at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">But it didn't last too long, because the Germans, the Russians decided to give <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> back to the Lithuanians because the Lithuanians always claimed that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> was the capital city of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and the Polish government took [it] away from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> in the Ist World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And then they gave back <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> to the Lithuanians and when the Lithuanians came in the first day there was a pogrom on the Jews but after the pogrom, a couple of days later, 1t quieted down....
QUESTION: None
ANSWER:  I beg your pardon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Can you describe the progrom?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Yes they beat up quite quite a few Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">They killed some some Jews and it was quite a scare. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">We didn't know what will happen to us, because we didn't know about <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We didn't know...even|though] I had an uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> but I still didn't know what to expect from the Lithuanians. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">But after a while it quieted down and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> came to normal again and we went back to work, our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">My father went back to work and we went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> and we learned a new language. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">It wasn't easy but we had to learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And life was going normal and I, we had an uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> because my mother came from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilkaviskis</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and she had a brother there and she hadn't seen him for over twenty years and for the first time she met him. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">She saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And it was quite an excitement in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to meet my uncle that we never knew and my cousins that we never knew and we didn't know what to think about them, didn't know what to expect from our uncle and aunt and cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">But they were very nice to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">They brought us a lot of food to eat, because we had a shortage in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> for a while, and then we went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> learn, life was going on normally, but after a while the Russians decided to take away all the <span class="REGION">Baltic lands</span> to incorporate it to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45"><span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Estonia</span> and then the Russians came in again. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Then it was a little bit different. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> but we couldn't learn any more any Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">We didn't have any <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew schools</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">We had to learn more Russian and nothing Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Then the people went back to work again. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">My father worked still in the Kehilla, but some other people they round[ed] up, a lot of Zionists, Zionist people and sent them away to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">They sent away a lot of Poles and a lot of Jews, rich Jews they took away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">But it but 1t wasn't bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">The situation wasn't too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We weren't threatened with our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">We had all the time we had not enough food but we could survive because the Russians whatever they saw they used to take away everything from the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">They never saw so much stuff in the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Whatever they saw they grabbed it and they used to send away to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And but we lived somehow and we were happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">We had our families and all our relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We had a lot of relatives in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">My mother had a lot of cousins there. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And we used to get together all the time and naturally talk about old times but this lasted like that until June 22nd, 1941 when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> was, the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> was bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">They destroyed quite a bit of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and a couple days later the Germans came in to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and then our troubles started. (</span><span class="sentence" id="66">Pause) When the Germans came in it was still...we didn't know what to expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">We didn't know even when people, refugees were coming in from from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , from the <span class="REGION">German occupied Poland</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> occupied by the Germans, they used to come in and they used to tell us stories how the Germans used to take away Jews and they never came back and all kinds of stories about the German, <span class="REGION">SS Germany</span> but we didn't believe them. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We said it couldn't happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">They couldn't be so mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">It's such a civilized <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">It couldn't be so bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">But after a while we did find out that it happen to us too, because when the Germans came in, in the beginning they didn't know who 1s a Jew and who is not a Jew, and but our non-Jewish neighbors used to point out the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">The kids with whom we used to play <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> or on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , they used to point point out a Jew, because we lived altogether in the same section and they used to take away the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">The SS with the help of the Ukrainian police or the Lithuanian police, they used to take away the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Whenever we used to stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> , they used to point out a Jew and they used to drag us out of the <span class="DLF">lines</span> and every once in a while they used to come in to our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and take away some people and...it was a very scary time for us, especially for the young people, because we didn't know what [they would do]...we were afraid they'll come and take our parents away always, every time we saw a German, and we had to walk around [them] [and] we had a curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Until five o'clock in the evening we were allowed to walk and we weren't allowed to walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We had to walk in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> and bow for every German. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">It it was a very scary time. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We didn't know who 1s going to be next and what's going to happen to us and we we weren't allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore and life was going on like that until '41 right before the Jewish holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">They...the SS decided to make a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> and there a poor section where a lot of Jews used to live there and the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> for the aged was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">The biggest <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">The <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">The <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> was there, and a lot of poor Jews lived around this <span class="REGION">section</span> and one night the SS, with the help of the Ukrainian police and the Lithuanians, they came in and took out all the Jews from there and they drove them to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ponary</span> [in the] outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> there and they shot them all there. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">We heard screaming and yelling and crying during the night, but we weren't allowed to look of the <span class="DLF">window</span> because those who looked out were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">We didn't know what was going on anyway until the next day our neighbors told us what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We had a lot of relatives there. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">My mother's cousins, all of my mother's relatives lived there and couple of weeks later they round up all the Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> and they put us all in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and surrounded us with <span class="DLF">walls</span> and with guards and we had to live in one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , two to three families in a <span class="INT_SPACE">two room apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">When we came in those <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> , we saw some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> were still made still where people were still asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">They were disturbed. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">They took them out in the middle of the night from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Some the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> were still set. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">People evidently were still eating, and this made a very bad impression of us, for us because our relatives, our our families were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">They were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">We had the Judenrat, Kehilla changed the name to Judenrat and my father was still working in the Judenrat there. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">We had our own police there. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">They organized police, fire department. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They had <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">We had even <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> for children. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">The little kids used to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I personally was too old to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">When the war started I was seventeen years old and we had to have a permit to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">At first they gave us yellow cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Those who didn't get a yellow card were taken away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we never saw those people. ( </span><span class="sentence" id="104">and a couple months..) We used to, people used to go out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to work in <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> or in <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , wherever they needed some help, workers, they sent out our Jews there. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And couple months later they decided to change those cards again for different kind of cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Pink cards, and then they took away those that didn't have any pink cards and we never saw those people again. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And it was pretty frightening all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Every time they used to give us a little more bread or horse meat we knew that's it's going to be a roundup of Jews the next couple days. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">They even came in one day, the SS, with the help of the Ukrainian police and the Lithuanian police and took away all the children from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and those little kids never had a chance to say goodbye to their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">The parents, when they came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from work they didn't find their kids anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We we lived all the time in fright; we were frightened all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We didn't know what was going to be next or who is going to be next. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">One time they caught my father walking on a <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">They round him [up] too, but he escaped from there somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I don't remember how, but he did escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">My mother was sick at the time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">She was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and we didn't have enough medication to help her, and she died in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We weren't allowed to go to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> even to see where she was buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">My father went because he helped to dig the <span class="DLF">grave</span> in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and he knew exactly where, but the children weren't allowed to go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">We lived in fear all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And every day was about the same thing as the previous day. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">We didn't know...then right before the holidays in 1943, right before the Jewish holidays, the New Year, the SS decided to liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they told us over the loudspeaker that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is going to be liquidated and we are going to be resettled. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">They didn't tell us where, and and we can take only what we can carry with us, no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Naturally we didn't have much what to carry, only our clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">That's all we could take. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And the next day we all congregated at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and they took us to a <span class="DLF">field</span> in right outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I don't remember the name where it was, but when we came to the <span class="DLF">field</span> we saw three people hanging, a young woman, and two young men and they told us over the loudspeaker that in case somebody has in mind to run away, to escape from this <span class="DLF">field</span> , will be shot or hanged right in front of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Men were taken away separately from the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">The men were taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Estonia</span> and there they were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">They were all burned alive for...they put logs and people and logs and burned and brought gasoline in and burned them and couple a years ago when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , we went to visit the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz Lokhamei haGettaoth</span> and I saw the picture how they put up the people and I saw my father's name and his number and it was very emotional to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Then how thorough the Germans were to record all what was happening to these Jews and we had to stay the whole night in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Only my sister and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">It was a very cold, miserable, rainy evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">When a child was crying or baby was crying, our guards used to take away the child from the mother and take it for (by?) </span><span class="sentence" id="135">their feet and tear it in half and throw it back to the mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Some mothers, from fright, even choked their own children. (</span><span class="sentence" id="137">Pause) It was going on like this the whole night. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">The next morning, we stayed in <span class="DLF">line</span> and we were sorted. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Those who went left went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> or some other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and I was fortunate enough with my sister went to the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I was lucky enough that they put us...they sorted us the same... they didn't separate us, and we went to the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Then they put us in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , about a hundred women to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> , no food, no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">We had to ride for a couple of days in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> until we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">That's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> , and we were met by SS men and they told us that this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> is built on <span class="DLF">Jewish graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">All the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> were concentrated there. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">They were shot and they buried them and they built the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">We had to go through the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">They shaved our heads in case somebody will run away they should find [her], they should know that we are the Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , recognize us. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They gave us stripped clothes with numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">From then on we never were called by the name, only by the number. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Then they put us in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">We had to sleep on boards. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">No blankets, no pillows. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We used to get up five o'clock in the morning and be counted and sometimes our kapo made a mistake in counting us, [then] we had to stay for another couple of hours and for punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Then they used to give us a piece of bread and some black water that they called coffee and we used to go out to work from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> to dig <span class="DLF">ditches</span> or at the <span class="DLF">railroad</span> or in <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Some people were lucky enough worked in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> sorting the clothes that they took away from us and while I was working digging ditches, there was a guard who asked me from where I was and I told him that I was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Then I asked him where ...and he told me is from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I said oh, I told him that my mother comes from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">He asked me from where, and I told him from where, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilkoviskis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">He says oh he comes from there too, and he knew my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">They were friends before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">They went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together and they were very good friends, and he told me how my uncle was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilkoviskis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">They shot them all there. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">They didn't take them in any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> or in any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> , nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">They shot them all there. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And then we used to come back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and be counted again and then they took us and then they gave us some coffee and bread again and we used to retire to our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">In the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> we used to sit and talk, talk about old times, talk about our parents and the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> that we went to and every once in a while, couple times a week, a German SS woman used to come in with a big whip and beat us up without any reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Used to curse us. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Used to yell at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">It was very frightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">We never knew what time it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">We never knew what day it was, because we didn't have any clocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">We didn't have any watches. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">We didn't have any calendars. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">We didn't know anything what was going on in this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Then one day, beginning of 1944 or so or in the middle, somewhere around there, they told us that the next day they are going to take us to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and they took us again by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="REGION">east Germany</span> somewhere, called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuthof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">When we came there they took away everything what we had again and they shaved our heads again. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">They gave us different numbers, but it was much worse in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">It was much bigger and we weren't allowed to go out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">We had to stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">We weren't allowed to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> by ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">We had to have permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">If our kapo felt like taking us, it was alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">If not, it's too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">We couldn't wash ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">We couldn't go to to clean up, to wash our hands or faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We were filthy there. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">We were hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">We looked like skeletons all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And I was sick with typhoid and my sister was sick with typhoid and we weren't allowed to go to see a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">But we had to nurse ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">We did...I helped my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">My sister helped me and women were dying there like flies. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">We were treated very badly there. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">The German SS treated us very very bad there. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Some women couldn't take it any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">They used to sneak out at night and go to the barbed wire and touch the barbed wire and kill themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">We used to get up early in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">We used to get our rations, bread and black coffee and once in a while they used to give us soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">It was called soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">It was from rotten potato peels or rotten cabbage soup, and then at the evening again they used to get the same thing...bread and coffee, and whenever we all sat around there and talked all the time or we were quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">We couldn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">We were so sick and we were so tired there. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We were, we looked like skeletons. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">We were dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Our faces were black from dirt and in 1944, at the end, it was in December, end of December, right before Christmas, they decided to liquidate this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> I guess and because the war was going on...getting bad and they told us and the next day they took us out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but this time we had to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">We didn't have any warm clothes, only that what we had on ourselves and we didn't have any shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">We had to cover our feet with rags and when somebody, a woman died we used to take away her rags from her feet and cover our feet with with more rags to keep our feet warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">We used to take away her clothes to keep ourselves warm, to put on something else on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">While we were walking we saw some people lying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , frozen, men frozen dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">We knew that a transport of Jews went by there. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">We used to start out about six o'clock to walk, in the morning, six o'clock in the morning to walk with a piece of bread and the black coffee and walk the whole day until we find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> at night where to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">There was a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> somewhere, or a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> ...wherever they could find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Then they used to give us again a piece of bread and coffee and we used to go to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">We walked like that for six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">We weren't allowed to to bend over to take some snow to wet our lips. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Those who did went over to take, they were shot by the guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Those who helped each other to walk were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">We weren't allowed to do that either. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">We walked like that for six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Then we came to a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and when we woke up the next day, we didn't see our guards anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">We saw some old German SS men. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">They took away the young ones because they needed them on the front, and they substituted with old SS men. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">They were even worse than the young ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">They used to beat us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Used to curse us. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">We were so sick in this <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> that we couldn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">We were lying around all day long in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">We didn't have bathroom facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">We had to go right behind in back of the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">We used to get coffee in the morning with a piece of bread and sometimes noontime they used to give us a little soup and then in the evening again the same bread and that was our food for the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">We were in this <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> for a couple of months and women were dying all day, every single day. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">We started out with five thousand women. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">About two hundred and fifty survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And one night, one day one SS man told us that the next day we are going to be digging ditches for ourselves, because the war is going very badly and they don't want us to fall in anybody's hands, and we're going to be shot and buried there, not to fall into anybody's hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">But the next day...during the night we heard some shelling and bombing and we didn't know what was going on, but when we got up in the morning we didn't see any guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">We didn't see anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And we were afraid to go anywhere and we didn't have the strength to go anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">But a couple hours later we saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> full with soldiers came, Russian soldiers...and they told us that the war was over right here in this part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and we can go wherever we want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">We couldn't go anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">We didn't have the strength and we were so filthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">We full of lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Our bodies were beaten up. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">We were dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Lot of people have frozen hands and their feet were frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Couple hours later a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> came and took us in to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and we came in to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">We didn't see any Germans there, because the people retreated with the German army and they let us loose and we started to grab food, whatever we could find. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">We ate whatever we found, whatever we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Some people overate too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">They they didn't eat the right food. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">They didn't eat normally. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">They took sick and died. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Some had to have their feet amputated because they were so frozen they couldn't walk anymore on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">We had to bathe ourselves in kerosene every day to get rid of the lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Burn our clothes every day until we got rid rid of all the dirt and all the lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">We were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> for a couple of months. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Then after we started to feel better, my sister and myself decided to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">We knew that our mother is dead and we heard in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Struthof</span> that my father was killed in <span class="COUNTRY">Estonia</span> , but we still wanted to go back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> because we left a lot of household goods and some personal stuff with our non-Jewish neighbors, and we thought maybe we can get back from them and sell it and use the money for clothes or other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">It wasn't easy to go back because we didn't have any transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">We had to hitch hike by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> or by...they didn't have any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> at that time, or by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...whichever we could. [</span><span class="sentence" id="260">It]took us a long time to get back and when we came to the <span class="DLF">border</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the Soviet Union, we met some people coming out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and they told us not to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span> because the situation is very bad there. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">There is not enough food and not enough work..not to go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , but my sister decided she is going back to get some stuff back from our non-Jewish neighbors, but when she came to their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> to ask for our clothes and other stuff, nobody gave her back anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">They threw her out of their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Byalistok</span> , on the <span class="DLF">border</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and I registered in the Jewish community there and I put an ad in the Jewish paper here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I had a grandmother here, my mother's mother and four uncles, my mother's four brothers, and two sisters in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And but I didn't remember their addresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I knew only my uncle's last name and my grandmother's last name I knew...and I put an ad and my grandmother used to read every day the Jewish paper and she found my name and she contacted all my aunts and uncles that I am alive, and couple of months later I received a letter from a one of my uncles and he urged me to go back to the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> , to <span class="REGION">west Germany</span> and from there he will try to bring me to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It wasn't easy to go back from one <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and I moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Byalistok</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and I lived there for a couple of months until I got acquainted with another organization, with other people, and I tried to cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> with them, with another kibbutz organization and from there I tried to to cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , but it wasn't easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">The first time we were caught by the Polish guards and they sent us back, back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">We couldn't cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But after a couple of weeks later we tried to cross again, and we succeeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">We crossed to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">We stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> a couple weeks and from there we crossed again to <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> , through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> , but this time we had warm clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">We had boots and we had enough food to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">It wasn't so bad the walking and in 1946 I came to the <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And there I took sick and I was in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sankt Cecilien</span> (?). </span><span class="sentence" id="277">That's not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> that <span

there and I didn't know he was there and a couple months later I received another letter from another uncle from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dover</span> , <span class="REGION">New Hampshire</span> , that his son was in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> as a doctor, but he left a day before I got the letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I got the letter a day after he left and I couldn't get in touch with him anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And then I got in touch with all my uncles and my aunts. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">They helped me a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">When I got better I went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I learned a profession...
