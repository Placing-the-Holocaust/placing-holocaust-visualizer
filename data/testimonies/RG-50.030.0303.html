<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Start off by telling me your name at the time of war, and where you were born, and when you wete born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name at the time of the war was Fela Yakomovich (ph) in Yiddish, and I lived in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ozerkoff</span> (ph) in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born the tenth month, the fifteenth day of 1926.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> you were born in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  It was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">The way I understand -- I didn't know at the time but after the war, people that were older than I am told me that the population was like 15,000 all together, and almost one third of the population were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">It was a nice little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">We had natural springs there on the outskirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">There were the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">birchwoods</span> and little <span class="BUILDING">cottages</span> where people came in summer for vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Life was, I would say considering all the circumstances in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , I felt happy, because I had a good <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My father was by trade a jeweler and watchmaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Watches he sold and repaired but jewelry which most of the time wasn't costume made, people didn't think much of costume jewelry. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">If they ordered a piece of jewelry it had to be either silver or gold, and it was ordered and my father made these things to order. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Many times I used to stand there fascinated watching him pour the gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">It was just like liquid poured in a form and how he fashioned all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And also the finish and the engraving. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">It was something -- he was a good craftsman. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">We were not rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We did not have a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Where we lived was a big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">It was going from one side of the street corner into the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">But it was one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , but the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , because it was on the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , naturally it had a different name, this <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">We lived on the side where it said Listopadova (ph) and the number on the <span class="DLF">street</span> was 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Upstairs we lived the business together. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">There was a lot of that in Europe -- people had combined things. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Downstairs my grandmother had for a long time a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> , but in the later years she retired and naturally she came to live with us, with Grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">But Grandfather died before the war, and I think he was fortunate enough, the only one to die a natural death from the immediate family. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I have a sister, which survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I had two brothers, a mother, and my grandmother lived with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> the year of 1939 -- I was not quite 13 years old, but I was through with <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , all the grades. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I had skipped some classes, this is why I finished early. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">So that was the time of vacation in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">My parents tried to decide what would I go into. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">We were very Orthodox, very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">My father was one of the Hasidim -- belonged to one of the Hasidic sects, it was called the Alexander Hasidim (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So, he did not want me to continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Their <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , which was called <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , was also a paid school. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">You did not get that free. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">It was a higher school of learning, and naturally we didn't have one in the beginning, and because we were so religious and so sheltered my father wasn't going to let me go in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to continue this education. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So, what should I be doing, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="40">First my mother thought maybe I should be a dressmaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I said not on yout life, because you know how the apprenticeship in Europe was for a dressmaker girl? </span><span class="sentence" id="42">First, you were bound for so many years there, and the first couple years all you did is to clean her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">She never showed you anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">You had to pass this test, you know, but I had a friend that owned one of those web where -- textile, web, I don't understand how you say this machine that they made material, <span class="BUILDING">textile mills</span> —
QUESTION:  A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">loom</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">loom</span> , that's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">They did that at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">The textile industry was very prominent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and that spilled over to our little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> because we were about only 14 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Almost like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I used to go and visit her and watch her, after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> she was doing all this and I thought it was fascinating. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">In the same <span class="DLF">street</span> there was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span> , the owner was Jewish and she said, "Oh he takes apprentice girls if you want to learn this trade." </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So, I don't know how I persuaded my father to let me do it, because he didn't think something like that I should go work in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , after all, but I said, " Iam not going to go there." </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Here if he takes me in, even at the age of 13, there were no labor laws over there, so you could earn money if you wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So, these couple months until the war came out I learned and I worked there for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I was happy because I got paid for it and I felt very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Also, because I didn't continue <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we did sort of at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> learn some mote. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I don't know what kind of education my father had, but he was so wise and he knew so many things that I really don't know where he learned all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So, we just kept on learning from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">We also had a habit of reading a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Then my father was busy working and had no time to read the newspapers, my mother would sit next to him and read him aloud the newspapers and I remember her chuckling about when the world news in this paper about certain things that happened in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And that's what we would call the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and she shook her and used to say, "Only in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> things like that can happen." </span><span class="sentence" id="61">It was something unbelievable whatever it was I can't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Anyway, she was marveling at the things that were happening here, even at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So, like I said, I was sheltered. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I was happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Until this fatal day when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  Just let me ask you one question. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">When you were reading in the newspapers were you reading about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and Hitler?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  Yes, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">My mother used to read and she used to be very stressed about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Refugees, people from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , Jewish people, came through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and I remember that she was collecting, going around and collecting clothes for them and other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">We donated a lot of things to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">My mother could not get over it because when she was a girl going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , quite young, the part where we lived was once Russian and once Austrian or Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I guess she was in <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Anyway, then she lived downstairs with my grandparents of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">After she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> she used to hang around the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and the Germans that came into the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , they were so polite, and she says, "I was a little girl and they came in they greeted me, and kissed my hand, and called me Fraulein Marta." </span><span class="sentence" id="76">That was her name, and she said, "I can't understand that those should be the same people, and that they would get so insane and follow a man, an evil man like him." </span><span class="sentence" id="77">It was unbelievable, and what we counted on is for the world to stop him. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">But it didn't happen, we know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Just it seems like to her unbelievable that nobody stood up against him and let him get away with whatever he did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  So, you were starting to tell me how things changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  Well, there was a battle a little whiles away from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kutno</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Soldiers, German soldiers were marching through there. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And while they were marching through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , they used to stop and do some looting and rounding also. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Because it was so close and shrapnels were falling in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , we all took shelter in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">There was a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which was a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> before the war, a <span class="BUILDING">movie house</span> , so all the neighbors gathered and we slept in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">We made sort of an improvised bedding, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">We brought our food and we slept there, but when the soldiers were marching through and trying to loot the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , some of the Polish people pointed out where we were and made us go out there and they just took whatever they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">To the end, there was nothing left to take, so the last soldiers that came up in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and went all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and couldn't find anything, you know what they took? </span><span class="sentence" id="90">My father had all these accessories for fixing watches and people broke the glass on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">He fixed, he put all different kinds of shapes of glass for all different watches. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">They picked up handfuls and put in their pockets. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Just the glass, would you believe that? </span><span class="sentence" id="94">We just shook our heads and didn't know what are they going to do with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">The battle lasted there for a few days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  This was when?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  September?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">They entered our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to stay -- I think what -- I don't remember the day, but according to the paper I got from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> , it was supposed to have been September 5. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I know they came in real early. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">The first day, 25 Jews were shot right there, on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I don't know how they could know these people were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I wasn't on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I just know that would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So, you see, there was panic. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Everybody run, hiding in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">We just sit there not knowing what would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And then again, they came into yout <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and then they took household goods. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Pillows, pictures if you had anything of value, whatever they thought they wanted, they took. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Businesses were taken over, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish businesses</span> , of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">On our <span class="DLF">street</span> , there were quiet a few enterprises, there were <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">On the left side we had a family that run a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> where you bought material and made clothes, coats and clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Then the lady that took over my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , she had a little <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Next to it was a tinsmith, like he was fixing pots and pans and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Then was another large family that was selling pots, and pans, and sweaters, all kinds of glassware. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> they have the <span class="BUILDING">Pottery Barn</span> , and it was something like that, on a small scale. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Farther down you had other <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Across the <span class="DLF">street</span> there were <span class="BUILDING">shoe stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">There were all kinds of little enterprises and everybody made a living because it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">industrial town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">There was a couple <span class="BUILDING">textile factories</span> and the rest of the population made a nice living, so that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">But all of this had stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">They took over <span class="BUILDING">city halls</span> naturally, the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And from then on the orders came. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Right away, the first days Jews were beaten on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , wherever you showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Our two <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were burned down. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">The rest of the <span class="DLF">walls</span> that remained standing the Jewish people were forced to dismantle. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">That's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">There's not a sign left in the city of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Nothing to remind you if you didn't know they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So, you see life was hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Then all the rules came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">We could not enter any <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">We still lived where we did originally when the war started, but we could not enter any <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> to buy any provisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We were not allowed to walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> , only on the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Later on, the arm bands came with the yellow stars. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">We had to form, like in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> a Jewish administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And they had to follow otders. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">The orders came to them, they had to carry them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Otherwise they come in and did twice as much damage as originally they wanted, whatever they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So, it was hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Right away they demanded so many young men, single men, supposedly for labor into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">But we knew later on that it wasn't so. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">These people send us one time a post card that they were well and we should send them food. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">People did, but you know they never received and these people never survived the first couple days, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I think they did exterminate them right away, these first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">That's what we were told. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Some of them probably went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Like my husband, when he was grabbed on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">He said, "I built some of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="153">He said, "I helped them put the <span class="DLF">walls</span> up," SO you see, some of them probably went that way and didn't survive or whatever happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Anyway life was hard, we did not have enough access to medication, to real food that we needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So, you see older people, babies, sick people died, lack of medication, lack of facilities too or lack of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">The first victims right away, and quite a few every day, quite a few. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">It was hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Then if you walked down the streets, they grabbed you off the <span class="DLF">street</span> and made you clean the <span class="DLF">roads</span> or whatever, beating the people, making fun of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Some of the religious people, the Hasidic people they caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Like in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> they made them wear the prayer shawls, and run back and forth, and cut their beards off. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">It was their favorite pasttime in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  Did this happen to your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  No, it did not happen to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">My father, actually had a small beard, very neat trimmed, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">But we -- my father ended up to be almost the only one in his trade in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and so from the beginning on we were forced to work for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">The local people pointed out that he was the craftsman. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">They came in and brought all their watches to repair and of course the gold they robbed from whoever they found. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">My father had to fashion other jewelry for them which they sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Some of them not even said thank you but some of them surprisingly brought some provisions, some food, which we appreciated very much but you couldn't say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">You were afraid to say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">You were grateful for whatever you got, no matter which source it came. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">It was hard to live and we were growing children and denied everything right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">It just didn't do good for our health and for our morals, because of this and trying to figure out what was going on, it was confusing. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">We just lived from day to day, not knowing what the next day will bring.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  Was there any sense of normalcy? </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Did you have friends, did you --

<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  Were you ever subject to any punishment or did you see any beatings or hangings or any sort of that brutal treatment?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  Well, I was grabbed once from the <span class="DLF">street</span> and made to scrub <span class="BUILDING">school halls</span> and they really were not dirty, it was just mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">A whole day long from morning till night. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Somehow, by some miracle they let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">When I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , my parents were really upset and they thought they would never see me again. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">What happened was, yes, I saw hangings. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">One day we were marched into the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">All of us, we had to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Sick people, even a woman that just had a child had to come with the baby there. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">All lined up, they marched in ten young Jewish men and the girls were errect and they were going to be hanged there. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">We all had to be witness, we all had to watch this. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">They claim they committed a crime against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> by violating the curfew, supposedly stealing something, any kind of excuse to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">The last minute before hanging they announced that they would let one of these men go free if the Jewish people could collect enough money to ransom him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Of course we wanted to save this person. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">People gave money. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">They let one man go but this is what I always tell everybody how cruel that was because all these 10 people standing there each one of them praying and hoping he would be the one picked and be saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">That's what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Can you imagine that? </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So, life was hard, like I say. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">People were dying every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">We just tried to survive from one <span class="NPIP">day</span> to the next, but we know that Hitler's goal was to erase the Jewish people from Europe and if possibly he would go farther, it would be more. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">That was his goal. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So, people were not dying fast enough even matter what they starved us and beat us, they thought the process is too slow, and to get a hold of us much faster, they wanted us in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , the small little <span class="NPIP">places</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hamlets</span> and little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> were concentrated and each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> in one large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">We lived in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> until 1942 under these circumstances.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="216">ANSWER:  They told us to line up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">QUESTION:  When was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">ANSWER:  I have to go back because I forgot an important thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Is that all right? </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Before we were sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> , they still wanted to reduce the population in half in out <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> before they separated us in the outskirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">We were first of all we were two years in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ozerkoff</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So, they wanted less people, so one day we were assembled in the <span class="BUILDING">school auditorium</span> , men, women, and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">There were Nazis in front of us and we were told to strip naked and parade in front of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">They looked us over like a bunch of cattle and we were stamped like a bunch of cattle with a letter A or B. We were told to get dressed, go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and wait for further orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">In a couple weeks or in a week, I can't remember the length of time, then we were told again to assemble in the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">There we were surrounded by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , machine guns and all these Nazis and told that the people with the letter A go to one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the people with the letter B go to the next <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">The people with the letter B they herded on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and drove them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">This is where my grandmother went. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">My eighty-some-year-old grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I was told after the war that those were the first experimental gassings with the exhaust pipe in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So, this is how she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">If this is really the way it happened, it was a horrible death. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">After that we were herded.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  Before we stopped the tape, you were talking about this selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">They took away half of the population which was marked B, what did that mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Who was taken away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  Sick people, children, older people, mothers of children, those people they got rid of because they thought women with children, their children would be a hindrance. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">They couldn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">The younger people they left using them for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Those are the people that went away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">QUESTION:  Now, just tell me when you were standing naked in front of all of these Nazis having to parade around, that must have been a very unusual experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I'm wondering if it was more difficult for the girls?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  I think I was shocked because I had never seen a naked male, not even my own brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">It was shocking. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I just looked around myself and saw everybody walking ahead so I figured this is what I have to do, trying to shield yourself, you know parts of your body because it was so embarrassing. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">But they just -- they were so impersonal, just picking up that stamp going like this, you know, like canceling things out. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">This is the way it looked to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">QUESTION:  What was the stamp?r
ANSWER:  It was like you stamp a paper, the same kind of ink. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">They told us to be very careful to see that it doesn't erase. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">That they would be able if they wanted to check this, if it's the truth which <span class="NPIP">side</span> we are going so they would be able to check this out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  Where did they stamp your
ANSWER:  On our bare body, up here, so we sort of walked around and slept on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> trying to see-- because ink does erase, this type of an ink, especially on your body. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">That is what we had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Now after these people were taken away, they created in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the outskirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">We were surrounded by guards, like three, four families in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Of course no sanitary facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I remember we had this one long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> in this little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">We all slept this way to have enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to sleep, sideways you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">This is how we slept, and whatever provisions we got, we cooked together and shared the portions of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">One time they thought they did us a favor and they gave us some horse meat which was contaminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">People got very ill and some of them died. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">One of them was my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">She was very, very ill at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION:  She died?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  No, my sister is alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">But from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> every morning we had to gather in front of the <span class="DLF">gates</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">They marched us out into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to a certain <span class="NPIP">destination</span> where were worked for their industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Almost all the population worked one <span class="NPIP">place</span> or another making warm shoes or we made little fur jackets from rabbit fur for the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> for the soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">There were different phases of doing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">One was the cutter, one was the pattern maker, and then the putting it together, the inspection and finally putting it in the boxes and so much had to be put out every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">When the day was over, we were matched back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Naturally, we tried to make something to eat, and rest up, and somehow to communicate with your neighbors and whatever you could, if you still had the strength when it was warm <span class="NPIP">outside</span> just to walk <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and just walk a little bit, feeling a little more free than being so confined in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Of course we were not free, we were isolated, but it felt much better and this is the way we sort of communicated or associated in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">But that was not -- they used to come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and line us up and pick out people out of this <span class="DLF">line</span> for deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Whenever they had a whim they would just come in and get people. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I remember one time standing in this <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">My youngest brother was behind me in between and he was so small and we found a box. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">We put him on top of the box and sort of hid this box between out legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">But there, I was again sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I had a bad infection, I remember, on this side of my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">My whole side of the face was covered up with a scarf, with a white scarf and this black salve put on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">You could see it through and this S.S. man was walking back and forth picking out people, looking this way and that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">The third person from me was a brother of my friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">He had a big birth mark, a red one on his face and he looked at him and he said, "Out." </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And I can't understand how he walked by that many times in front of me and did not take me out of this <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">This is something that I will never understand the rest of my life, but it happened that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">When I tell people, they say, "It wasn't your time to die." </span><span class="sentence" id="288">That's all I can figure out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  What about the organization of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="290">You had a Judenrot or some sort of Jewish organization that administered the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">ANSWER:  Not much of it in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">There wasn't much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">QUESTION:  How did you get your food, how did you --
ANSWER:  Rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">They used to send it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">There was some kind of administration but they were not very effective, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">In the beginning before we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , there were representatives and an administration and you went for your food there, even for your heating material. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Because when winter came around, we didn't -- like I said I think to you before, we did not get the regular coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">It was some kind of a substitute. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">It was wet and it came in blocks almost like bricks and it was called torf (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="300">It smelled terrible when we were burning it, but we had no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">This is what we used to get, but in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> I don't remember really how we heated this <span class="NPIP">place</span> in winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">We lived like that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ozerkoff</span> from the end of 1940 until 1942 and this is when they decided that they want the Jewish people concentrated in one larger <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">This way they can get a hold of us much faster. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">So, they liquidated all the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , and hamlets, and every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> and deported the people to the larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">We found ourselves in the second largest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">There we were taken by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">There weren't that many left of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">You can imagine that we fit in a row of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street cars</span> there and walking in the <span class="DLF">line</span> to those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street cars</span> , you always have to line up. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">By some miracle that these people who lived a little distance from us, the father, the family was intact and the man was blind. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">So, he was like in front of me walking but he couldn't see exactly to keep in <span class="DLF">line</span> , so his movement was like moving out of the <span class="DLF">line</span> , and the Nazi walking next to us thought he was trying to escape and he shot him dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And another man and my father carried this dead man into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> and carry him along into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So, we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baluter-Mark</span> (ph), Balutzkerinek (ph) in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">There we were all lined up and we were told to give up all the gold or whatever we have because if they would search us it would be much worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So, anyway, everyone gave up everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">QUESTION:  How much did you take with you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> in terms of personal --
ANSWER:  Just personal belongings that's all you could take, but sometimes people took on themselves, on their person, jewelry. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">You know no matter how much they searched, some people smuggled it through. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">They risked their life, but people did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">So, then, we were marched into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> assigned to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, also with several people. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">The first we lived on a <span class="DLF">street</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linarskenein</span> (ph), but that was just like a <span class="BUILDING">weigh-station</span> because we had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go and we sort of slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> there even. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">There wasn't even a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk bed</span> or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Later on, this other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , these two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> got vacant and me and another family were assigned to this <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">It was called Berkayoselovicha (ph) and we lived on that <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Each one of us has to be assigned to a <span class="BUILDING">work place</span> , and there what would you call the <span class="BUILDING">work places</span> were called in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , "resorts." </span><span class="sentence" id="324">This is what they called them. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I don't know for what reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">QUESTION:  Who assigned you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">ANSWER:  I don't know, I think the Jewish Admin -- or wherever. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">They wanted us to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">This is where they send. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Each one of us got a Russian card and the provisions were -- the only time you could get your provisions was after a whole day's work. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Then you stood in <span class="DLF">line</span> , I don't know how long just to get even your loaf of bread or the other provisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Sometimes people fainted dead away, in these <span class="DLF">lines</span> , but we had no choice, you see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto Lodz</span> had thousands of people, not only from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but they had people from all over Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">It was confusing. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">At the same time they were shipping us in from all over, they were deporting people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">It was like coming and going, coming and going every single day. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">It wasn't safe on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">You never knew if you went to the destination of your work if youd return because they could grab you on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and just cart you away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">QUESTION:  That was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Of course the leader of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> was Haim Rumkosky (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="341">He was the king. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Everyone knows that. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">He even had money printed and I think his picture was on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">That much I don't -- but I know it would have to be that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">He taught -- this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> would be forever because we did such important work for the German government. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Military orders and whatnot all, so for the time being he thought we were safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">What was safe there? </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I wasn't safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">First of all we were hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">What they gave us wasn't enough to live on. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">People were dying, hundreds every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Some managed to bury the people on their own, but some of them couldn't so they were buried -- they came down and picked up the dead bodies in a bag and buried them in one <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">It was hard walking down the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">There were some children that by miracle survived, and still were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And you saw them standing on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , raggedy, swollen, hungry, asking for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Who had anything to give them? </span><span class="sentence" id="357">We were starving ourselves, but it was something hard to take, even when you were hunery because you felt I can't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">You felt helpless. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And we lived there for two years, but in between there, like I said, there were called deportations, different phases. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">It was called lists, so they send lists, they send the order to the administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">They wanted that many young people, let's say single people, the oldest from the family, supposedly for labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">So the administration had to make a list who should be going to these deportations. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">That was called the "Time of the Lists." </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Then there was the time of the shpera (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="365">They sealed off the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and they came in with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and just grabbed people out from the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and took them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">They also, I think, came several times to the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> and took people out. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">But despite of all this, there was -- people were determined to normalize this life. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I know for a fact that there were several organizations, several <span class="BUILDING">culture places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Of course I never went because my parents were too protective. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">After I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from work, they were so afraid that something would happen to us if we go out, that they just did not permit us to join any of these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">But I know that there were cultural events held and people even went like to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">It was forbidden of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">It was like in hiding, but it was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">QUESTION:  Who was organizing all these activities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">ANSWER:  I think there were teachers there and other people that were capable to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">QUESTION:  Was there an actual underground or resistance organization?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> -- I don't know if there was much underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">You see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> was a little different than let's say for instance <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">It was sealed much tighter and it was hard to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">We had little communication with the outside world. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">That's why it was harder to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Even less heroic what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">QUESTION:  Did people have radios? </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Did you have any idea what was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">ANSWER:  We knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">We didn't have a radio, but someone must have because news came filtering through to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">We knew what was going on on the fronts. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">You see, we heard that the Russians were advancing and the Allies were bombing, but because we were in such terrible situation, and because my father always said that this war was going to be a lightning war. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">He used to say in German, a blitzkrieg, because of all the technology and the air warfare, this wat was going to end fast, but it didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">You see, it dragged on and that's why when all these news kept on infiltrating into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we listened to it, hoping but somehow it sounded unbelievable that Hitler is being defeated or he is losing a battle because he ts so almighty and look what he was doing to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">We were helpless and we could not defend ourselves, so it was do we believe or do we not believe what we are hearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">QUESTION:  You talk about the deportations. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Let's take the first period, that "Time of the Lists." </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Was there any logic to who was getting deported?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">ANSWER:  Of course, people you mean from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , the original people who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> or what do you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">QUESTION:  Well, what segments of the population?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">They took, let's say, my sister had a friend who's parents were taken away at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">She was alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">She was single. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">There was no family there so they used to take single people first like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Then young able bodied people because they told them these people are going for labor into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">But you see, those people really disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">There's not a trace of these people left that went with the lists. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">They were all exterminated, and we know that for a fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">QUESTION:  What about -- the lists, I assume, were made up by Rumkosky and his --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">QUESTION:  What about old people, sick people, children --
ANSWER:  Oh, these were naturally deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">These were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Sick people and old people had not place in Hitler's programs. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">They were not useful at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">They go first because they can't even work. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">He worked us to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">That's what he wanted anyway, but in the meanwhile, we were young, and we were healthy and we were useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">So, we survived as long as they felt that they can work us to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">At least they have something out of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">But older people, sick people, were of no use to them, so naturally those people were exterminated right away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  Were there regular selections on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> that you saw or you were a part of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  Not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , I have not seen that. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I just know of -- yes, because my sister's friend went, you know, with those lists, she went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">QUESTION:  Did you ever see or hear Rumkosky?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">ANSWER:  He drove by once in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">horse and buggy</span> carriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">This was the only transportation, sitting like a king there. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">He was grey and old at that time already and thinking God knows who he is. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">You know, it was like a man of life and death almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Some people say -- after the war we had one time a discussion in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milwaukee</span> after we saw the film about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> , we had a discussion about Rumkosky and some people said that he was forced to do what he was doing, but I don't see it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Me, personally, I don't see it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Because if he would have been forced to do it, he would have a different attitude than what he had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  What was his attitude?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">ANSWER:  Like he was the king and he was going to last forever and rule this kingdom here because he's so safe and secure because we are doing such a job for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that they can't do without us. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">That was his main idea, that that's why we are safe, but no Jew was safe in Nazi occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">We know that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  Tell me about the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">ANSWER:  Well, there were different places of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">My father was assigned to a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> called the <span class="BUILDING">machine shop</span> , repaired their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machines</span> and all other instruments which were shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">My brother, my older brother worked in a <span class="BUILDING">steel shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">My sister worked in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marishean</span> (ph), and that they were making straw shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">The method of making is really interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">They bought all these stacks of straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">They lined them up on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> next to their feet, put water on it, and they had to stamp on the straw to make it softer. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Then they used to braid the straw with their hands and shape them into shoes for the soldiers on the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And she always used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with bleeding hands from this job. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">My little brother, I exactly don't remember where he worked, would you believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I know that he went to work every day and I worked in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they were embroidering emblems for the uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">My mother had brought-home work. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">There was such a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">It was called in Polish halumintzfau (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="447">She could bring the work <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">She was tearing all kinds of rags apart, making strips, braiding the strips and fashioning rugs. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">What they needed that for, I have no idea, but that's what she was doing and every day she had to make a certain amount and deliver it the same day. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">So that was the work we were doing there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION:  Did you have any sense that women were treated differently than men in terms of --
ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">We all had to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I think that maybe the men did some more hard physical labor than the women, but I can't tell you exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  But you didn't feel different.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">ANSWER:  No, no I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">As far as deportations and treatment like that, we were all treated equal. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">That's the way I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">QUESTION:  In the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> or the "resorts," were you ever aware of efforts to kind of sabotage the production of hunger strikes or anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">ANSWER:  No, no, maybe in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> where people were things might have happened, but where I worked I never encountered, and people did not there go on hunger strikes. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">We were at the point of starvation and I don't think people could last two or three days if you went on a hunger strike. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">That's the way I felt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">QUESTION:  You were at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with your family at night?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">QUESTION:  Do you remember what you talked about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">ANSWER:  Always trying -- first of all we were trying to put food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Then you tried to keep clean, which was a hard thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Washing clothes was a task within itself, because we had no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">You had to walk like almost a half a mile with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> to get water. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Then you had this board that you rubbed on and you boiled the clothes on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> if you possibly could. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">That was another chore which required a lot of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">But sometimes before the curfew set in, we had some neighbors that were from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> that used to come over and just sort of talk things over. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">My father was always the one very optimistic, thinking that this will end soon and that he hoped to be alive when this happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">But it didn't happen that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">He didn't live to see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Slowly though, he did repair work at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Somehow he got some instruments. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">He was repairing watches in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">People in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , believe it not, some of them could afford to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Sometimes they paid and money was helpful because every <span class="NPIP">place</span> no matter how much you starve there is always a little <span class="BUILDING">market</span> where you could buy for higher prices something to help yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">QUESTION:  Even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">ANSWER:  Even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">One day one of the Jewish policemen, the ghetto policemen and said to my father he's being summoned to <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bolitzkerenik</span> (ph), and we thought what did my father do? </span><span class="sentence" id="484">He will never come back alive, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">But you see, before they took all the -- took us out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ozerkoff Ghetto</span> , we all had to register that you were a tradesman or whatever, they looked through this list and summoned my father to do some work for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">When he came back it was like a miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">He came back with work, watches to repair and all that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And they walked him back, the Jewish police, back there when he was done with his work to return the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And would you believe that now and then some of them would give him some food for the work, even those Gestapo people? </span><span class="sentence" id="490">It was amazing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">QUESTION:  What kind of food did they give your
ANSWER:  Bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Bread was the staple. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Bread was something we craved. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Bread was something that I dreamed of. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">We always said someday -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> where I was, we always used to say we didn't dream about eating cake or meat or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">We used to say if ever the time comes all I want is a loaf of bread and eat enough that I feel my stomach 1s full. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">This is what we want, just a loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">So, bread was very important, to the point we were starving so much that sometimes when a person died in a family in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they did not report him for a couple days so that they could pick up the bread ration and help themselves for a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">So, you can imagine how desperate you were and how hungry you were to go to such measures to get some food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">QUESTION:  Was that it? </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Did you eat anything else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">ANSWER:  They gave us potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Certain other stuff, whatever was available. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Sometimes they gave us canned food, canned meat, but that was called, you had to be at work every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">They made a day when if you were at work that day, they picked at random a day and if you were there, it was called in German the schteichtag (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="506">If you happened to be working that day, you could get a portion of that conserved meat, and it was mostly horse meat anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">That was the treat of a lifetime, I'm telling you. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">They gave us vegetables, a lot of carrots. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And those white carrots, you know, those long big, I don't know what they were called here, but we called them white carrots. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">They had the shape of a carrot and we ate a lot of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">So, all different kind of staples that they felt weren't really -- beyond their dignity to eat, you know, they just brought into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we got a certain amount of everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  Did you work every day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  Yes, except Sunday, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">QUESTION:  What did you do on the day you didn't work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">ANSWER:  Cleaned, did our clothes or tried maybe to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and see what's going on if you ventured, it you dared to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">QUESTION:  You had mentioned to me that there was some little ponceon (ph) or someplace where workers could go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">You were rewarded if you were a good worker and you made enough production in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and the foreman was favorable to you, they had also foremen there, you know, the one that told you what to do, then you were rewarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">There was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like <span class="BUILDING">sanatorium</span> and you were rewarded with seven days to go to this <span class="BUILDING">sanatorium</span> to rest up. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">One of my family, my older brother which was younger than I am, but he was the older of the brothers, he got rewarded and he went for seven days there. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">When he came back he told us how wonderful it was to get three meals a day and to be able to rest and all of us in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> dreamed about going there even for such a short while and being treated like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">So, there were a lot of songs in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">People were making up songs about Rumkosky in Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">A couple words I do remember in Yiddish, and then there was this song about the Heime (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="525">That we sung in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">We always made up songs, Yiddish or Polish so a couple songs, those couple verses about Rumkosky I remember and a couple verses from that Heime.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">QUESTION:  Can you sing or say them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">ANSWER:  No, I won't sing, but if you want me to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">First about Rumkosky. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Okay, it was like this. "</span><span class="sentence" id="531">Rumkosky, Haim..." (speaking Yiddish). </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I don't know whoever understands this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">QUESTION:  Can you just in a sentence or two just tell me what it's about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Rumkosky, Haim is a very good man. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">He will still treat us, we will eat rolls with butter. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">This will be our treat and what can we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="538">We Jews, what can we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="539">It's a terrible thing that happened to us,what can we do, that we are hungry and our stomach demands food every single day. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">It doesn't understand about the situation and about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="541">The stomach demands the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So, in Yiddish it sounds a little different. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">It has a better meaning, but everything loses in translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">QUESTION:  What was the other song?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">ANSWER:  The other song was in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Do you want me to say it in Polish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">ANSWER:  (Speaking Polish).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="549">QUESTION:  What was it about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">ANSWER:  It was at the end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> stands this <span class="NPIP">place</span> called the Heime and it's a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> without bars. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I would like to be there for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">There is this guy called the director, the commissar, they come and entertain you and they give you food to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">This is the dream of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that you dream from day to day and living from day to day this is what we dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Only Iam very sad that this, what I'm having here is only for seven days, a short seven days, that it couldn't go on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">QUESTION:  Even though you said that you couldn't go out, your father wouldn't let you go out at night, but I mean, did you have a sense that there was a humor and a camaraderie in the midst of all this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">ANSWER:  There was. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I think people were meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">They had certain organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I think there was even little entertainment probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I was not aware of it because of that reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">But I know there was some culture in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> , of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">We all tried -- people tried to resist this drudgery and this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and tried to make something normal out of it so we could exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">You see, with us, it was again being in the evening <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and talking if you didn't have anything to read, it was just oral support. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">My father knew a lot of stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">He was a good story teller, and my little brother, he was a natural. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">After he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from this <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> , before my mother made the supper and it was light enough, he used to go out there in the corner and meet some other little boys and he used to spin stories out of his head and everybody ran after him and used to say "Yankele, tell us another story, please tell us another story, and it was just so exciting to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">That little boy, I think, not because it was my brother, but if he would have grown up, he would have been a genius he was so smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">It was unbelievable because he went to a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> , at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because he wore all the Hasidic garb, and the director of the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> was trying to persuade my father he should let him go to the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> because he's such a smart boy, he would have loved to have him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">But you see, like I said, boys, Polish boys a lot of them were anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">My father said to him, "I understand in the class you can see that no harm would happen to him because the way he looks, but if recess time and the kids go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , you can't be evetyplace and shield him from all the beatings or whatever things would happen out there." </span><span class="sentence" id="571">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  Were you aware of in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> , various social welfare efforts, <span class="BUILDING">medical stations</span> or <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER:  There were <span class="BUILDING">infirmaries</span> and so-called <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">There were also <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> , but we never got food out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> like soups directly. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">What I think is people that didn't work or sick people that they got help from the <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">The only thing that we got from the <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> that other like people like us that stood in <span class="DLF">line</span> waiting for the potato peelings to be thrown out. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">We brought big sacks <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , washed these potato peelings, eround them with a meat grinder, and we made potato pancakes out it. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And sometimes when we didn't get enough, if you happened to have coffee grounds left over, you mixed the coffee grounds with the potato peelings so you had something more to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">I remember eating that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">QUESTION:  Did it taste good?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">ANSWER:  It tasted delicious at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">One time we got raw oatmeal. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">What a treat, and a little bit of oil and brown sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">A ration that was very unusual to get in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , so you mixed a little oatmeal, a little bit of oil and brown sugar and we ate it like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I kept on saying, "Oh how delicious is this. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Why didn't I ever think before the war to eat something like that?” </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Anything was delicious.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">QUESTION:  I bet you didn't eat it after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">ANSWER:  No, I didn't.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="590">ANSWER:  Two years, from 1942 to 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">1944 was the year when they started liquidating the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">You see, most of the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> were liquidated already. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">It seems like we were almost the last ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">1944 slowly they made up, the Gestapo asked every day so many people have to be resettled, they said, for labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> has to be liquidated and the people will be resettled. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">So they demanded so many people every day for these deportations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="597">QUESTION:  Did you know where they were being resettled?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="598">ANSWER:  No, nobody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">You know, there were whispers, terrible whispers, about <span class="NPIP">places</span> like that, about shooting people. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">But it was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">We just somehow couldn't understand that one human being was capable of doing something like that to another human being no matter who he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">How can people do this? </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So it was like unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Maybe they're makine more of it than it really is. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Fooling ourselves, that's what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">So, up to the point with the lists and the sealing off the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , these deportations they dragged people out but here they didn't want to bother anymore with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">They didn't want to put a lot of effort in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">So to the end after the first people, they announced that every family that would come quick would receive, each person will receive a loaf of bread and some jam.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="609">QUESTION:  Who made this announcement?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">ANSWER:  It came through the Jewish Administration from the Gestapo that this is what we'll receive. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">So, people went. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">A loaf of bread was magic. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">People went. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">There was no mote like, hesitance. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">No mote trying to hide any <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">People went and in the beginning we sort of tried to, like moving to the back of the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">You know, when you stand in a <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">We tried, but finally there was no way we could avoid it. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">So, one time they also told us to take personal belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Make bundles and take along, of course we're only going for resettlement. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">You know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">So, we made some bundles, each one of us clutching that loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">We reported for deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">We were taken into a <span class="BUILDING">train depot</span> where all these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> were waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">So many people counted up in one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I really don't remember the exact count, 60, 70, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I just know we were packed in there like herring. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">One <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> thrown on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> for all our humanly needs and the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were shut. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started moving and panic right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">People were crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">People were screaming and it was hysterics because what's going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="632">What will happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Where are we going? </span><span class="sentence" id="634">You could hardly sit unless you sat between somebody else's legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">The movement of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and people needing to relieve themselves by the time this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> filled up and started sloshing around all that stuff, you can imagine the smell and the situation in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">We traveled the whole night through, and when it got to be light <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> slowed down. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">There was always a little <span class="DLF">window</span> , even in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> , so the man next to it tried to peek out and see where are we going to because it was slowing down real fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">He turned around and said, "Oh, I can see barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">It's some kind of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">People in striped uniforms busily walking back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Hey, maybe we really did come for resettlement and for work," trying to console ourselves and giving a little bit of courage to what was waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Finally when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped these same people, the prisoners from there, they were the ones that came to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> when the <span class="DLF">door</span> was open to guide us into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to tell us what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">The bundles were left standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">They told us they would bring it to our <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="645">It has our name on it, of course they will know where to look for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">There were three dead people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> while we were coming out. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">We didn't realize that they didn't survive the journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Women and men were separated and told to line up in five and move forward each one of holding still the rest of that bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">We didn't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Where did we come to? </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Someone whispered next to me to this prisoner, "Hey, what is this <span class="NPIP">place</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Where did we come tor" He said, "You're in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Okay, we knew of atrocities but the names of the camps we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">It didn't ring a bell. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">We didn't know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Looking forward to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> to walk in, we saw the sign, the famous sign that said in German Arbeit Macht Frei, English, work makes you free. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Big joke. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">My father, my two brothers on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> in the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="659">My mother, my sister and I in one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and two more people. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Always in five. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">That was their military thing, lining up in five. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Moving forward and my brother was on one end on the edge and I was on the other looking over to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">He said to me, "Why do you just hold the bread? </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Eat some of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">You need your strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">We're only going to showers and we'll meet again." </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I still didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I looked at him, and that was the last time I saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I never saw him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">That was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">So, anyway, we moved forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Finally we came in front of these S.S. with their canes, sort of like batons pointing to the left, to the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">My mother was in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">She was dragged out right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I still remember what she was wearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">A beige sweater and a blue dress with little flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">She looked back, but we could do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">He dragged her out and pointed to the left. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">My sister was told to go to the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">When I stepped forward he looked at me hesitating, saying in German, "How old are youe" I could not speak I was so stunned. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I couldn't -- it didn't register what was going on here, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I couldn't figure out what was going on here. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So my sister standing on the side said, "Oh she's old enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">She can work. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">She's strong." </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I don't know why she said that. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">We didn't know which <span class="NPIP">side</span> is good which <span class="NPIP">side</span> is bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">She just said that by instinct, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So, he stood hesitated and pushed me towards her. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Over there again, we had to line up moving forward closer towards the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Before we entered we had -- walking farther down the <span class="DLF">line</span> we were told to strip naked and this on <span class="DLF">line</span> always in five they looked us over again, anyone that had a birth mark or a scar from surgery or some women if they were middle age that survived the first selection and had some wrinkles on their body, were also taken out of this <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">From then, before they took us into the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , they shaved the hair on out bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Every <span class="NPIP">place</span> a person has hair has been shaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">It was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">My sister was standing next to me and I didn't really know who she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">We had to call out to each other to realize who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Then in these <span class="INT_SPACE">shower stalls</span> , so-called <span class="INT_SPACE">shower stalls</span> , a couple drips of water came down, running to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> each one of us were given a dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And what they did usually, on purpose, as the tall persons got a small dress and a small person like me got a huge dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">There was a problem which we did ourselves adjust exchanging the clothes between ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">From there they lined us up again of course in five, marched into an open <span class="DLF">field</span> and told to sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">We were surrounded and guarded by women, hardened criminals that were there I think for a couple of years, and they were the so-called kapos. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And they had canes, walking around with these canes and making sure we sit in an orderly <span class="DLF">line</span> of five on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , on the bare <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> there in an open <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Well, the <span class="DLF">air</span> was heavy there , but seeing so many people, we thought maybe it comes from some kind of an industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">There are so many people, someone must be doing some work. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">So, this is what we always thought, but they straightened us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Trying to move to warm ourselves one and another's bodies because it was a very raw day, windy, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> is not so far away from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Carpethian Mountains</span> so the <span class="DLF">air</span> is always sharper. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">We were called. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">They screamed at us and called us a bunch of cattle, pointing out to those big <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> , that smoke, black smoke was belching out of there and saying, "You're not worth anything anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Tomorrow this is what's going to left of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Look up there, you see this? </span><span class="sentence" id="712">This is what is going to be left of you." </span><span class="sentence" id="713">So you can imagine how we felt, but still somehow, it didn't penetrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">We didn't really and truly realize in what kind of a situation we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">We were numb. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Dehumanized there already at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">So, we just sat there. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Somehow it didn't happen that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">In the morning, they lined us up and marched into a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">QUESTION:  Did you stay in this <span class="DLF">field</span> overnight?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">ANSWER:  Yes, on the <span class="DLF">field</span> we sat all night long.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">QUESTION:  I just need to clarify one other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Do you remember what month this was in 1944?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">ANSWER:  I think it was the end of August. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">So, they marched us into a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">There were 500 women of us, always, in this group.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="727">QUESTION:  All from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">ANSWER:  Yes, from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we were all women out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Naturally some of them were not natives of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz City</span> , like I, from all different little <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and even some of them from different parts, from different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , that happened to be deported into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="730">We had one woman we called "the Francisca." </span><span class="sentence" id="731">She was originally French and was deported there and she used to swear in French something terrible, and she was mad after a while, but the others were mainly from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="732">So many women assigned to one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , just plain, bare <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> and another one of those prisoners ruling the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , and she was -- her title was the Blockova (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="733">A <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was called a <span class="DLF">block</span> and she was the Blockova. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">She ruled this <span class="NPIP">place</span> like a queen. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">You had to do everything according to what she told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">You could not on your own go and relieve yourself if you had to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Only when she told you it was time. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Some people could not control themselves, and she used to beat with that cane people half dead almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">With the rest of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , every morning when it was still dark out there, we were lined up and counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">The German tzail-a-pelle (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="741">You could stand there for hours if they thought the count wasn't right. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">It could rain, it could stotm, and we had to stand there and be counted and be sure we were all there. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">At noon, we were lined up again, always lined up. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Five women were handed a bowl, some soup in that bowl. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">We did not get any spoons so we had to count swallows and be sure we didn't take too many swallows to it would be enough for all the five of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">That was the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">We were there for several days, I really don't know exactly how many, but let me tell you, every day was like eternity, it was never thinking that we would ever get out of there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">QUESTION:  You didn't work there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I don't know if it's true, but after the war, the assumption was that the end of 1944 they were bringing in people for extermination at such rate that the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> could not accommodate them. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">You see, we were marked strictly for extermination because we did not get any tattoos anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">That was the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">So, people were just sitting piled up waiting their turn and this is what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">We were just sitting in these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> like waiting out turn to be exterminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And somehow one morning at the tzail-a-pelle they took this whole eroup of 500 women from this <span class="DLF">block</span> , drove us into a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , gave us some more clothes, some wooden shoes, underwear different dress, a little portion of bread and again into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="756">There were less of us in each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , we had more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> for our needs. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started moving again. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">A couple <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> I remember they stopped opened up this <span class="DLF">door</span> and the S.S. man that guarded us told us we could empty that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> , so we figured that's better treatment than what we had before. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">We traveled several hours and final destination we ended up in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , but our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where we dwelled was outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tzazel</span> (ph) and the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> where we traveled into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for work was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Popinville</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="760">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tzazel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="761">It was a sub camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Noyagomen</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="762">There we were assigned to <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="763">The <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were much smaller and every morning of course we lined up again for tzail-a-pelle. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">After that, we were released back and took turns going to pick up the ration of bread for the whole day. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I remember we wete in a real -- I and my sister found ourselves in a real small <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">There were about 15 women only there, which was very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">It was unusual, so we took turns. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Every day another woman went out and brought the bread which we divided by some miracle we found a string. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">We had to see that it was the same so we made a measure out of that string and cut the bread accordingly so each one had the same amount. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Coffee, they gave us something warm to drink, the so-called coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">It was slop, but we didn't have any other utensil except the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> that we used during the night for our needs because there was a curfew after a certain time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we could not even go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="772">So, whoever's turn it was to go get the provision, emptied the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> , swished it out with cold water and this is where we brought the coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And this is what we did drink from. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">You can imagine how dehumanized we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">It didn't matter where this stuff came from, as long as you could keep warm, as long as you could fill your stomach. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">That's what it mattered. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">The conditions were a little better in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="778">On the weekend, on Sundays we could wash our clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Naturally we had nothing else, so we walked around in our coats, the so-called coats they gave us, our underwear and dress were washed and hung out of in winter by that little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> that we had and dried it out and if it didn't dry in winter good enough by the time we had to put it on, we had to put it on the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">It just dried up on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Wooden shoes, every morning we were divided into groups, certain people stayed right there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tzazel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="782">They were marched to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Popinville</span> and they were digging foundations for little <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> they built for people that were bombed out in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="783">But it seems like I was always the unfortunate one traveling into the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and my job was cleaning the rubble from the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , from the bombs that destroyed the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">We had to clean up the rubble on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , put it in wheelbarrows and push it into a certain <span class="NPIP">destination</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="785">That was the beginning of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">At that time already when the Allies started bombing day and night, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , of course <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> was an important harbor city, so their aim was to destroy anything that was of importance to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Three, four times, even sometimes five times a day they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">We worked in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called in German the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heileche-gaistvelt</span> (ph), and it was a <span class="BUILDING">radar station</span> right next to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Everytime you could hear the little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> up there, that radar turning and beeping, we knew that the Allies were coming to bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And it was funny, when the first alarm sounded for the Germans to take cover, the population, we watched them run with their suitcases and their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggies</span> and their children and a great panic trying to hide before this disaster. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">We looked at one another and we were laughing because this did not represent this big superman race. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">They were scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">They were just like you and I.

<p><span class="sentence" id="1196">ANSWER:  He was not injured. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">The thing is that they were bombing the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> like I said before, day and night, the flyers came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">The German population fled into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> , but we had only a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> to go into. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">They did not think of our safety. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">They just didn't want the flyers to see any movements from <span class="NPIP">above</span> , so we were herded into this <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and this is where we stayed through the bombing until it was all clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">So, one day, these flyers came so close and the bomb fell so close we all from the impact of it, from them, we all flew on top of each other and the lights went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">This was the end, we thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">We were buried alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">When the all clear sounded and we made our way back up, we saw, see I consider all these savings like a miracle, we saw why we were saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">The bomb fell a distance away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">It did not explode. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">It made a huge <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">We could see that bomb in one piece, but the rubble that was flying buried our guard, the S.S man up to here in that rubble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">He was leaning against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> of that <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> where we were downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">See, he was not allowed to go in with us -- not together, you know -- so he was leaning against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , and he stood there helplessly buried into this -- in this rubble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">Well, who do you think digged him out? </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">We did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">And you're always astounded, why did you do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">So what should we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">What choices did we have? </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">We had wooden shoes coats with marked numbers, shaven heads, and a strange <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that we don't know anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">Where do you think you could run without any money and without any <span class="NPIP">destination</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">Any <span class="DLF">door</span> you would open, maybe they would denounce you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">Sooner or later someone will come and free this guy, then they will hunt us down, one two three. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">We stand out in a crowd, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">Because we were running away, we would be shot on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">None of us wanted to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">Because of the situation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , each one of us deeply in heart hoped that by some miracle, by some chance, we will survive this, which did happen, that's why I am here to tell this story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">So, it was a good thing that we did not try to run away, but before I finish telling the reason, every <span class="NPIP">place</span> I speak everyone is astounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">They couldn't ficure out in the beginning why we did this, but there was no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">We had to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1227">QUESTION:  Did you stand around and look at each other and say, "What should we -- should we do it?"</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1228">ANSWER:  Well, one started doing it so we just all helped along. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">He did not even -- he didn't say anything, just went about his business, you know, the way it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1230">QUESTION:  Did he treat you more kindly afterwards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1231">ANSWER:  I really can't remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">Some of them were nice guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">Some of them were like they were forced into this service, but you know we never had any personal contacts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">They never expressed their feelings or whatever they felt about this <span class="NPIP">place</span> that we would know exactly what they were thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">But some of the actions, you know, talked for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1236">QUESTION:  Maybe I missed something, this particular guard was male?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1237">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1238">QUESTION:  Were most of your guards in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> women?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1239">ANSWER:  Most of them -- no, they were sort of half and half I would say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1240">QUESTION:  This was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1241">ANSWER:  It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> , but we had men in the beginning, then women guards, women, S.S. women started coming in and they also marched with us to work, watched us and like I said before, they were more vicious, some of them, than the men.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1242">QUESTION:  Were any of the men to your knowledge flirtatious at all with the prisoners?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1243">ANSWER:  Maybe, I don't know that for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">Maybe, with those people that were on top, that they had to be in contact, like convey the messages what we should do or whatever, it could happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1246">QUESTION:  And actually, because we're so out of order will you just state for the record where we're talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">When we're talking about a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> where are we now again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1248">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1249">QUESTION:  And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1250">ANSWER:  Well in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> when we digged this guy out of the rubble.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1251">QUESTION:  Right, but the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp you</span> were part of at that time was which one?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1252">ANSWER:  We were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Noyangomen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">It was a subcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Noyangomen</span> , which was also an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">So, you see, like taking us out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , it was no big deal to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">They could always get a hold of us and exterminate us whenever they felt like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">It was a labor camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">We were treated better than a real <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> or an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">But we were never sure of our lives from day to day what's in their mind and what they could do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">So it was really --
QUESTION:  Were you taken directly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tzazel</span> , or did you spend any time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Noyangomen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1260">ANSWER:  We spent -- no, not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Noyangomen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , actually we were taken directly into the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> while they were preparing this camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tzazel</span> , we stayed in sort of a huge <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">It must have been a <span class="BUILDING">military building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">One <span class="NPIP">side</span> was leaning against the water there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">There the 500 women were also in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> with the same people were ruling it and then after several weeks we were transported into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tzazel</span> there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1266">QUESTION:  Did most of the 500 make it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1267">ANSWER:  Some of them died after liberation of typhoid fever, quite a few of them from our group, but I would say quite a few of them made it too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">Our -- my two friends and my sister, they made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">We were liberated together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">One of them died after the war here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , several years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">She died of cancer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1272">QUESTION:  What did you learn about your family and how did you learn it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1273">ANSWER:  We learned from -- first of all my mother was taken out of <span class="DLF">line</span> and went to the wrong <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">We learned the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> meant extermination. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">About my father and two brothers, we weren't sure, but this man which was a neighbor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> , he was in the <span class="DLF">line</span> behind them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">He told us that they went to the wrong <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">Still, we searched. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">By some, by some coincidence we thought maybe by some miracle, maybe they did survive, even going the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">It happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">Very few, but it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">So, we still fooled ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">You know, we -- when we were separated, we made sort of a pact that if we survived and could get back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> where we came from, we would meet there, but I never had a chance to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">After I was so many years in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> that nagged me, thinking maybe, I haven't found anybody anyplace maybe some one is in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> , maybe somebody that survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">I went back in the year of 1978, ended up in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> there was, like from close to 5,000 Jews, it was like a dead city. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">One Jewish man lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">One person, would you believe that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">Of course, there was hardly anything Jewish around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">My sister knew I was going and she said, "Remember to go to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">The only one that died a natural death was my grandfather, "Go visit his <span class="DLF">grave</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">So I asked this man he should take me to this <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">He said, "What <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">You know, they made a <span class="DLF">pasture</span> out of the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and they took all the stones, you know, the matzevos (ph), and they made a <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">And when I looked at Schindler's List, the movie, and I saw that, and I says, "Oh my God, he did exactly the same thing in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">After liberation, this man petitioned the Polish government to get this <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> out, but you know they don't come out in one piece and not exactly the same shape anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">All these stones were taken back in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and they're just laying there in two piles of rubble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">It was impossible to distinguish who was who and there was no <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">It was like nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">That's what there was left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1299">QUESTION:  How did you find this man?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1300">ANSWER:  Should I tell you something? </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">The minute I walked into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , my younger daughter traveled with me, I knew right away where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">I saw the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we lived and because I was standing there looking around, it's such a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> , that one guy walked over to us and said, "What are you looking for?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">And I said, "Well, I used to live here once." </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">Then he knew right away I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">So he said, "I'll take you to a man here, he lives here," and he took us to this guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">So this is how we did communicate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">You know, I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> that year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">I traveled a little bit and I thought I have to go back there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">My younger daughter was hysterical. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">She almost had a nervous breakdown going there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">It was like she was -- after a while she said her feeling, she thought I'm not safe here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">Here they come to exterminate me too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">Then she looked at all these things, but what I wanted to do, and the reason I went back 1s, this is where I left my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">This is where I left my brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">I don't have a <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">You know, it comes a High Holiday, people go on the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> before Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">They say prayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">I have no one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">I have no <span class="NPIP">where</span> to go and here I am in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and I have this chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">So, I went and said Kaddish and sort of communicated, and I felt good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">I paid my last respects to them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">So, I have a little peace of mind that I did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">It made me feel good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1324">QUESTION:  How do you think you survived all this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1325">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">When I talk about it, some people say, "It wasn't your time to die." </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">And when I go and speak in <span class="NPIP">places</span> , they say, you see, you survived so you will be able to tell us what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">So this is their interpretation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">You had to be here to tell us what happened so we know what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1330">QUESTION:  Do you think it required any special inner strength?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1331">ANSWER:  Well, my sister, for instance, cannot do that a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">She does it where she lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milwaukee</span> now, once in a while.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1333">QUESTION:  I mean the actual surviving, do you think that that took something special?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1334">ANSWER:  It did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">It took determination. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">It took will power because I know that a lot of women were in the same situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">They were just as weak as I. They gave up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">When you give up, you die.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1339">QUESTION:  But you didn't?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1340">ANSWER:  I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">I don't know why I kept on going and like people said to me when they look at me, "Amazing that you could push that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelbarrow</span> with all this rubble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">You're so little." </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">I said, "You'd be amazed what you can do under threat and determination if your life is at stake."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1344">QUESTION:  Did you ever want to die?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1345">ANSWER:  There was a time where we thought -- there were instances where I thought what 1s it all for? </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">There's no end to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">What's going to happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">And I thought, "Maybe it's better to be dead and not suffer any more." </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">But then, I talked myself out of it, because my parents always said, "Remember life is precious and hold on to it as long as you can." </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">My father was very Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">He was a Hasid, but when all this came out and we were observing the kashrut, the laws, you know, but then all this came out, he said that the Bible interprets anything, any measures to sutvive and live are excused. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">So, it's excused to eat anything that help you to sutvive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">That's the way he felt, and I always remembered that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1354">QUESTION:  One mote question, I'm sure that when you think about or dream about these years and I'm sure it's often.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1355">ANSWER:  I do dream a lot, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1356">QUESTION:  Are there a couple really strong images that constantly come back to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1357">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">The time when I lost my parents, the time of liberation, that all comes back to me, and sometimes I have nightmares after this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">| wake up my heart beating, the Nazis are chasing me, I'm trying to hide, and every <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> they find. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">One time I was running so fast I was out breath and I thank God that I woke up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">I could hardly catch my breath while I was waking up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">I could remember everything so vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">So, it's hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">I think the Holocaust will walk with the survivors till the day we die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">It's a part of us, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">It will always be with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">It'll never leave me, I don't think so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1368">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you want to say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1369">ANSWER:  Pardon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1370">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you'd like to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1371">ANSWER:  No, just that I'm glad that I'm living in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and I'm grateful for the people that want to listen to me and maybe, doing this, maybe I'm doing something good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">I know the children in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> are listening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">I know from their comments because they write me notes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">I get stacks of letters and from their comments I can see that they were listening to me, because I know that they quote certain things that I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">It made me feel that I'm doing something good and useful in this world, and maybe I will not change the world, but I have a tiny little part in trying to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">This is very satisfactory. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">End of Tape #3 Conclusion of Interview </span>
