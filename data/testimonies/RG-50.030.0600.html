<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Can you tell me what are your first recollections of your family life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Surprisingly, I can remember back to when I was three years old, which always amazes my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I remember that in my <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , they put a rug with flowers in the middle and a design around the edge. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And I wouldn't let anybody walk on the flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And I would go around the corner to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And that's my first memory of my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">But I then I did remember my daughter went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with me in '74, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And I we went to where I lived, my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and but it wasn't until was that when we went into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">We went back in 2001, the spring before 9/11. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And I was invited by the City of Hamburg. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And my husband said for my daughter to come with me because she would remember this and pass it onto her children. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">So it was a wonderful trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And I had explained how my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was laid out. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And I had a <span class="INT_SPACE">veranda</span> in front of my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And we went and knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> or we were standing in front of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and people said can we help you? </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And it was an American married to a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And I told him that this was the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And so they invited us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And it was really interesting because she said to me, Mom, this is exactly the way you described it. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">So I could we jump ahead?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  I would like to maybe ask you also about your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">You said you had a brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Was it an older brother or younger brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  Yes, my brother is three years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And we were completely assimilated in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">My father had been in the German army, and had all sorts of medals. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">He was injured in the first World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And we had a Christmas tree. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I didn't really know I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> until quite late, then I had to change <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  What language did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , was this German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  German, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  Did you have any Jewish friends or just German friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Of course I had my grandmother and grandfather and my uncle who had was somewhat disabled. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">He had the flu in 1918 and stopped his mental development so he was though he was an adult, he was approximately the age of twelve or thirteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">We played a lot of games he taught me games and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">My grandparents lived quite a walking distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And there was another German family living near us and, yes, I was friends with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I can't really recollect a lot of friends, I guess they didn't stay in my memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Would you say that your family was a religious family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  No, my mother came from an orthodox, very orthodox home. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And she rebelled against it because she said that they were not allowed to do anything on the Sabbath, and her father would walk <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and get around the corner and light a cigar. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So although they had a maid, I guess, who was allowed to turn the light on but she so she married my dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">My dad came there was a lot of money in the family, but my father was not raised Jewish, although both his parents were. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">His father died when he was three. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And he was a playboy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  Isee.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  And he was he went to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> and was an attorney. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And as I remember what my mother said, her father who was orthodox really stepped in between that and didn't want to marry her to marry my dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And so she was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for a year and told if you still want to marry him when you come back after a year, it's okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So she did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And my parents kept everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I have papers and papers and papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I have all of their letters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  Really. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">That's very valuable. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">We are I'm sure going to talk about that in a little bit too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  You mentioned that your brother was three years older than you were. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">What's his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  His name was Osfeld Eric Stark (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="64">My mother specifically, she was always worried about the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But probably because of her background because she was orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">My father felt it was a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And my mother gave us each international names. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Eleanor is good in any language and Eric also. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">So but in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> my brother was called Osfeld (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And so he changed it, of course, to Eric Osfeld.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  Were you very close with your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  Quite.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  Did you play a lot together, did you go to the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I was eight when I went on the Kindertransport, but I was about five, I think, five or six when my brother was sent to <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And my brother was very precocious and very intelligent, and he was constantly listening to what we then called the wireless, and so it was could you go up and get that postcard? </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So they sent him to <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> by a German teacher at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bunscord</span> (ph) you probably heard that before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  [have to say that I'm hearing that for the first time right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Could you explain what it 1s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  It was a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> for German Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And it was headed up by a woman and something I don't remember the name, but I think I have it written. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">We called her Tatta Ana (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And by the time well, a lot of the children from wealthy families were sent there, especially the boys.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  So you mentioned that your family was quite affluent, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  No, she was a housewife although we had lots of maids. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So she didn't really do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And remember that in 1937, my father bought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes Benz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And I was told later by one of my cousins that Dad was the only one our family was the only one who owned a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in the '30s. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I remember that when my father bought this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , it was green. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I have a picture of it at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">My mother immediately had to have a driving suit made to match the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Things I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I lived a very typical European life that was certainly totally opposite of what my life with my children was, but it was my parents would send me to kindaponceons (ph) on holidays.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  And I was so relieved because one of my sons very much looks like my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">My other son is very much like his dad's family. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And Brian always said I'm fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I don't need the checkups and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And I said you have to get a checkup.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  Because of the heart issue, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">ANSWER:  Because I thought my grandfather died of a heart attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And my father had his first heart attack when he was in his 50s. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And so I was and Brian finally had his wife made him have a checkup. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And he wrote to me he lived in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">He's been part of <span class="REGION">corporate America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And he wrote to me and said or he called me and he said mom, my heart's perfect. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So and then of course my aunt told me, oh, no, your grandfather committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Best news I ever had.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  Well, yes, I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and it was certainly not a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Very not long before I was sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I had to change <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And I believe it was very scary in those times. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">But until then it didn't really affect me. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">My mother, of course, but she never would have told me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">QUESTION:  She + already afraid of what you are saying, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">ANSWER:  Yes, about the precarious situation we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And as I have studied history and learned, I was appalled at how my father could have kept us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">He could have left. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">My mother had a huge family and they all left in early '30s, up to '37 and they settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">They were in the tobacco business, and continued their business in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And my mother wanted to leave, but my father in retrospect, I understand, that my father knew that he would have to start life all over again if he left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because he was an attorney and a judge in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and German law is based on Roman law. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  if he went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , he could not practice law.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">QUESTION:  That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">He would have to start pretty much from the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  And he was a very arrogant man. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Like I said, this is happening to all of the other Jews, not me. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">SoI I don't remember doing much with my parents except for when my father bought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , we used to on Sundays, go out into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> , I guess, and I remember buying ice on a stick that was, you know, it was quite new.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="611">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="612">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">There were quite a few. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And it's really interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">But anyway, we changed our name to Rolfe. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And my children are very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">They would never have liked that name. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Anyway it wasn't a family name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="619">QUESTION:  It's hard to spell, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="620">ANSWER:  Rolfe is a nice name. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">But that's how we got that name, and it's an English name and people always ask are you related to so and so Rolfe? </span><span class="sentence" id="622">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">So that was done before we got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And I was thinking of something, but the thought just left me.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="651">QUESTION:  Did you think that your parents also became more religious after they came to the <span class="COUNTRY">states</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I understand you said that you were helped a little bit in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> by a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="661">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">ANSWER:  And oh, my goodness, I think as I remember, we did have a Christmas tree in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And I think we used the Menorah also because we had this big we had both. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">But I don't remember very joyous Christmases. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">My mother was befriended by a lot of Quakers when we first came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And there was one wonderful thing that I remembered to this day, the Quakers had on New Year's, they had New Year's callers.</span></p>
