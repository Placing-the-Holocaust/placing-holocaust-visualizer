Mr. Haber, let’s start with your date of birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  March 8", 1910.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  And you talked about, in your other interview and by the way if we ever repeat anything, we’ ll try to just cover things that we haven’t talked about before. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">But I’m sure that you don’t remember everything that you said and didn’t say, so I might remind you sometimes if we’ve already talked about something. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">But in your other interview you did mention that you went, you had an unusual opportunity, you were growing up in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetl</span> and you were one of nine children, and you had an unusual opportunity to attend a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">public high school</span> and eventually became a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And I’m wondering how it happened that you had this opportunity to study in a <span class="BUILDING">public high school</span> and where the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  The <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debica</span> , which is in the district of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> and that was about nine kilometers of my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And we had, from the age of three, in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , always a teacher, special for religious purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">But by this same occasion we were studying normal classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">So in the age of four I could already go in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to the first class of <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> and I still was a good pupil, because no one of them was on the level I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">But I finished there the fourth year and my father decided I have to go into the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , which was Debica there. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">In the same time, he put us in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">quarter,</span> that means to live in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of a Rabbi, which was teaching us the Hebrew and the religious teachings. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">In the same time I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Polish public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And that was a very difficult experience because we have to get up in the morning at six o’clock, sometimes earlier, and before we went to the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> in the morning for eight o’clock it started, we had already to pray and to learn Hebrew and to learn everything about religious life. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And more and more. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">So, I was there about six years living with this Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">At the same time after I graduated from the normal <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , from the seven classes, I applied to the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , but I was too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Because it was already that you can go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , start <span class="BUILDING">school</span> only by the age of seven, and I was four years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">But I was somehow fortunate, my father knew the director of this <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And he spoke with him and he said, “Well I cannot do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">He has to go normal now to the sixth class at least, at least and to repeat.” </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And my father said, “You know, make him a test.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And I got a test and I passed the test, but still 1 he couldn’t take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I had to repeat the seventh grade another year. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And then I was accepted to the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And there I matriculated there and so I continued my studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  So, what language did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Well, the first language we spoke, that was Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My father was very religious and he want us to know the Yiddish, we are spoken. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">But we had Polish Gentile servants, too, so we have to speak Polish too. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And surrounded by peasants who are speaking Polish and you have to knew the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">In the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was Polish of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">When I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debica</span> there was in the fourth class was already German, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So I had German, Polish and Yiddish, and of course, Hebrew, which was, it was the liturgical language, to pray. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">At the age of three we started already to learn Hebrew and we knew the Hebrew alphabet and we knew to pray and most of the prayings until today, I know by heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Most of the thick books, we learn, we have to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And the first when you opened eyes at the <span class="BUILDING">religious house</span> , the first is to wash your hands, that’s the first things. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And to make a blessing about the washing the hands and you make a blessing for the food and you have to thank God that you got up in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">That was the first Hebrew praying and that was at the age of three. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">At the age of four we started already to learn the Torah, which is the Bible, the Old Testament. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And so we continued to, so therefore I am quite acquainted about religious Jewish life. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And then later on, of course, in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> we learned about, in the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> we learned about history and that was very interesting, world history, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And German literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And therefore I, until today, I am quite acquainted with the world literature and especially the German literature and the Hebrew, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And the Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So, this is the way like it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">It was a very hard thing, because the distance to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was like I said about nine kilometers, eight or nine kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I don’t remember exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And for Saturday we used to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I mean to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And when we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> Saturday, there was the traditional Friday evening meal with the praying, with everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">In our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was there a minyan, which is the quorum of ten people which is praying, Jews, by Jewish law. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And my late father, by himself with his own funds, he founded a Torah. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">He let scribe it, and we had a new Torah in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and there was a praying in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my father was the master of the ceremony. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And the people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> around, which were few, not always was there the quorum of ten people. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">But Saturday morning was always a praying in quorum. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">If it wasn’t quorum, so how many it was, but it was the normal pray. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And we had to know it and to participate. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And that was in afternoon, my father take a sleep one hour and he took us 1n the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , me and my brother, because my older brother was with me in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at this Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">He was sitting down and we had to repeat what we learned all the week. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">My father wanted to know what we learned and how far we are continuing to progress. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And that was the way like it was in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Of course, Saturday was like in the Torah is resting day. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And that was the religious way of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Nothing was working, nobody was working, even the servants. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Only to feed the animals, to milk the cows and that what was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But not working in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , not other work was performed. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Only the most necessary for surviving, which was necessary.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  My father by himself was a Hasid. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">But he didn’t go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ropcezyce</span> because the old Ropcezyce Rabbi wasn’t more. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">The founder of the Hasidic movement which was Reb Nafthali, which you 2 know. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And he was no more alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">There was already third or fourth generation there and there was no potential Rabbi which could, which could affinate (ph) my father there. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">My father used to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sans</span> (ph) , which was quite a distance, about fifty miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">To go for holidays there to the Rabbi of Sans (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Also sometimes OfBobof (ph), which is also a little shtetl there in the surroundings of Sans (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="80">They were the very famous Rabbis, which is the continuation of this Rabbis is now here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">They are siblings and family offsprings, which are continue this Hasidic movement of Bobof (ph) and of Sans (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And that was, my father was a Hasid of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">He wasn’t, by himself, he wasn’t a blind Hasidic. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">He wasn’t overdoing. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">But the basic religious things were holy for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And that was my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Of course my mother did everything what my father said to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">The thing was, my father, his first wife passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And from his first wife, gave birth a daughter and by the birth she passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">He was a young widower. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">He was already thirty-five or thirty-six years old and a matchmaker found him a girl of sixteen years somewhere in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And she came to live with him, and she was my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">She gave birth to the nine children. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And we were in touch with our sister, because Jewish law recognize it, one child, when it is from the same father, is a sibling, more even than one mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">That is the religious way and tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Interesting enough, our sister, she married a very interesting man, who was, in the beginning he was a teacher in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , teaching us the religious ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">He was very educated in Jewish Talmudic teachings. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And he married her, and he succeeded, he became quite a rich man. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And she gave birth to eight children. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And there are only two children survived and they are still living. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">One is ninety-two years old, lives in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And the other one is eighty-five years, that’s the youngest one, eighty-four years old, lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="206">ANSWER:  It was a time I was involved in Zionist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">It was a time I thought maybe one has to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> those times. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I will not deny there was not in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">But you know anti-Semitism until today has many faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">There is an economic anti-Semitism, there is a political anti-Semitism and there is a racist anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And for me and my observance, my conviction, I think if I analyze the Jewish situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , it was more economic anti- Semitism, with some reasons, objective reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">They were nobody’s fault, but the situation became so that this anti-Semitism has his logical reasons, logical reasons, maybe it shouldn’t be, maybe it is nobody’s fault, but it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I cannot say there was a racial anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Well, there is in every <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> , there are some extreme people, which they can get... and they are more doing it for personal reasons and for gaining something of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And this is also the political anti- Semitism, which is to gain something to rule over people. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And Jews were more educated, absolutely more educated than the common people in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Because as I told you before, I started to study when I was three. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">You know, and this gives, whatever you study, it gives you more advance about people which are just starting to study something at the age of eight or nine or ten even. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Some of them didn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the Polish people didn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">There was illiteracy, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">So, when it came to elections, the Jews, they knew what they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And the masses didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Maybe it is until today a lot of masses don’t know when they are going to vote, what they need and what they want. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">It is until today everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">But especially in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , which was, which wasn’t so educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">There was a lot of people who didn’t have, it was only by propaganda, which was from mouth to mouth, from promises and so forth, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And then <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , I would need to go into the situation of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , how <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> became free after being occupied by three <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  Well let’s not get into overall historical...
ANSWER:  Yeah, I understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I understand, but the Jews even, in each occupied party, had different opportunities. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">In the <span class="REGION">Russian occupied part</span> they couldn’t progress like this we could make in the Austro-Hungarian or in the <span class="REGION">German occupied territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So here comes the difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Education, knowledge and education, that was, is and that would always be the point. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And this gave also the impulse for political views and for a kind of organized anti-Semitism, which for the Jews, for the victims, it is not important what kind of anti-Semitism it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">He is anti-Semite, why and what, we didn’t analyze and that wasn’t important. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">We had to feel it and that what it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">QUESTION:  When you were in the Army then, in 1935 and ‘36, did you, were you primarily with non-Jewish Poles?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  Oh yeah.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Were you discriminated against at all for being Jewish during your service?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">ANSWER:  It’s difficult to say that you were discriminating because Army is not the thing which gives you the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">You have so many things to do that you don’t have the time to play these games. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">But, but, the officers, the Polish officers generally, generally, were anti-Semites. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">What kind? </span><span class="sentence" id="247">They were so educated, they were so prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">That was the elite. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">That they, but of course, they didn’t, they didn’t want to show up as anti-Semites. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">But you could feel it, you could feel it. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Not everybody felt it. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And then like I said, the poorer Jews went to the Army because they were not able to pay to get free from the Army, not to serve. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">The rich Jews who didn’t want to go to the Army, there was always finding a way of bribery. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">To whom? </span><span class="sentence" id="255">To the Polish officers, to the Polish doctors, to the Polish secretaries, so that they made themselves sick and they write and they are sick and they cannot serve. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And so the poor and little Jews were serving in the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">There were no too many of the intelligentsia which was serving in the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And then there was another thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">After matriculation you are going to the <span class="BUILDING">officer’s school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And in the <span class="BUILDING">officer’s school</span> , they didn’t want the Jews to become officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">They were there because they were, after matriculation that was the law. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">So usually they find always a way to send them back to the normal Army, not to live in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to become an officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">There were officers, Jewish officers, but very few, very few. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">It was difficult to advance, to be a Jew and to be an officer, a high officer in the Polish Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">There were higher officers only medical officers, because they needed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">They have to take them and that’s what it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">QUESTION:  So, by the time you were in the Service, you were a dentist, were you a dentist already?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">QUESTION:  Yeah, so you were, your goal was just to do the service and then get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Is that right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">When the time came to go out, I got a phone from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> that one doctor who was by himself a Colonel in the Polish Army, doctor, dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">He had <span class="BUILDING">private office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">He was ready to retire and he had a <span class="BUILDING">private office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">But he got a heart attack and they took him to <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And they phone to me, they knew that I would go liberated, if I will be able to replace him, to fill out that position. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">So the last day in the Polish Army... and even the greatest anti-Semite in my unit, came to me, they make me a party, my departure, that was ad hoc make a party for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">He came to me, he said, “You know I am twenty years in the Polish Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I am professional officer, high officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I’m a major there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="281">He said, “You are the first Jew I know had such a good time in the Army like you have. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Like you had.” </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And I said to them good bye, and I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And immediately the next day I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> and I start to work because I had to fulfill this, this... later on he was released from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">He survived and he came to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , but I still was working with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">He couldn’t work anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So I was working with him about a year and a half, something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And then I opened my own <span class="BUILDING">office</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  But you said you didn’t have such a good time in the... did you have a good time socially? </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Is that what he meant? </span><span class="sentence" id="291">That you got along with other officers? </span><span class="sentence" id="292">7
ANSWER:  Oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I had a good time, well I got along. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">They were all, needed me because I was there practicing dentistry. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">After the first, first recruiting, six months, then later on I organize a <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> and I receive patients. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So they had their families and they were coming to me and I had really a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I came from the Army with some saved money, which the families of these officers paid to me for services. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">That was very, very, very little payments, but still I came with quite nice saved money.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="302">ANSWER:  In 1942, when we fled, went with the, on the Aryan papers, so-called. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">We came to a strange <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And there the lady, which was the owner of the <span class="DLF">farm</span> which we were given the address from the priest to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">That was his sister-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Where I was there on this <span class="DLF">farm</span> , there the Armia Krajowa started to organize herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And we came there, and I went there as a refuge, refugee from the <span class="REGION">occupied territory</span> , German-occupied territory which occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poznan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I said I am from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poznan</span> , and I am hiding away because I was a Polish officer and I am hiding from the German Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So when they became knowledge, they turned to me and maybe I will join them. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And I said, “Well I cannot be a fighter to go and, with your fighting.” </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I went with them sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">But I organized a <span class="BUILDING">sanitary station</span> , when some of them were wounded they brought them to me and I gave them some bandages or some treatments, which I had a <span class="BUILDING">sanitary station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And I also took care on the weapons which they had, and the magazine. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">They had some magazine in hiding in the <span class="INT_SPACE">shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And they had some weapons there, which they organize somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And I was taking, cleaning and taking care of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And that was my function, I was going there and there, I was going close to every night I am going there and taking care of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">There were some actions which I am participating, but I was never going in the first <span class="DLF">line</span> to go to fight with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Never, ever.</span></p>

QUESTION:  I have to...
ANSWER:  I will approach to you a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">They had their spies which are spying what happens to the Polish people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">What they are talking about and what they are doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And some of them denounced that there is some activity, that they have some activity. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And they choose Easter, 1943, yeah? </span><span class="sentence" id="327">1943 they choose to go to make an action and to arrest these Polish people who are in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">They knew from this people which they send in this Volksdeutsche and they took there ten people. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Between them was the commandant of this base. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">His name was Bilig (ph), Bilig (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="331">He was a student of law, of the third year, second or third year. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">He was the commandant of this unit there in this <span class="REGION">region</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And there was other, there was a teacher and there was several people. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And one was liberated by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">That was suspected that he was collaborating with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">They released him. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">The other nine were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">This commandant was so beaten up that he couldn’t survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Because one of these people who 8 was release, he saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">That they took him from one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to other after hearings. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">They took him. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">He was all blooding. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">He didn’t survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">No one of them survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">So the commandant of this <span class="NPIP">part</span> was the brother of this woman where we were working on this <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">His name was Kostetski (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Max Kostetski (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And this lady, which we were there on this <span class="DLF">farm</span> , she was a very fine, noble person. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">She knew that we are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">She knew because when we arrived there, the brother of the priest was there, just there. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And he was very angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">He said to the priest, “What did you bring these Jews here? </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Why did you do it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And he run away very angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And she knew, but she was a very, very [phone rings] fine, noble person. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And she tried to influence her brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I am an officer and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And she was helping us a lot with bread, with food, everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Even when we later on, after the denunciation, we had to live in other <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">She used to come to bring us bread and all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">She did help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I think maybe fifty percent of surviving we had to thank her. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">She was very, very, very kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">QUESTION:  What was her name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">ANSWER:  Pardon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">QUESTION:  What was her name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">ANSWER:  Oscietska (ph), Stanislawa Oscietska (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Her father was anti-Semite. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Her husband was a terrible anti-Semite. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And the priest was also an anti-Semite and still that was the priest who helped us and gave us the paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">QUESTION:  What was anti-Semitic about him? </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Why do you say that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">ANSWER:  He was anti-Semite, but he was, in my opinion he was economic anti-Semite. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">However, he didn’t have a business. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">But in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> he was preaching the Polish people to support Polish people, to buy at Polish people, but most of the businesses were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And therefore Jews were calling all of this kind of expression, they were calling anti-Semite. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">That was economical anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">They want to support their own people. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">I don’t find it wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">I don’t find it wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">I think he as a priest has an obligation to his people. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">How we didn’t like it, how we didn’t want it, but still 1t did hurt us economically. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">But he, as a human being and as a priest, he told us, “I want to help you because it comes a bad time to you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="384">So I cannot say he is a racist or he is a political anti-Semite. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">He was economical anti-Semite. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">He was anti-Semite. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">We are very sensitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">We Jews are very sensitive, but we have the reason why to be sensitive after thousands of years of discrimination. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">But still, 1f you have a little bit brain and you want to understand human nature, you can find some objective reasons why some people are behaving so, and not like you would like they will behave. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">We would like to be taken care on us as the Chosen People. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">But we are not the chosen, to take care on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">We are chosen because we have obligations. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">We choose to have the obligations. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">This is the chosen. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">We took the Ten Commandments, we took the Torah, we took everything, but we have to perform it. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And if there is, you have to love your neighbor as yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">You can never love like yourself, it is allegoric. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">But you don’t have to harm your neighbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">You have to behave. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And that, which in many cases we are missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Even in the holy books we sometimes mention, “We are the Chosen People. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">You can do to other people this and this and this. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">You can take interest by non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">You can do this, you can do this, but not to your brothers.” </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And that was a segregation which was in the 9 Torah. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">There is segregation which we choose to make the segregation. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">This is the Chosen People, not only in the positive sense, a lot of things is negative. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And therefore a lot of people who are open-minded, they are taking the teachings of our fathers, not strictly verbally. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">You make some selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">You have some humanitarian obligations as a human being, not blind to follow scriptures, but you have to find a way how to live with people, how to respect other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Which is very, very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">How do you respect others, so others will respect you? </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And this is my conviction which I came after so many years of life and so many readings and studying of all, all this which is written in the Jewish and in the non-Jewish books and teachings. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Well it’s not a... if you know , introduction, but I mean you have to know to whom you are speaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I think maybe sometimes I am going out of the framework which this has in mind, but I still am open-minded of everything what happens around.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">QUESTION:  Yeah, I think it’s valuable for the listeners to know who, who you are, what your beliefs are and where you’re coming from and how you developed those beliefs. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">So, but also I wanted to find out, just make little bit clearer the chronology and the geography of what happened from the years 1940 through 1944 or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">You were, you were, you told the story in the first interview about how you went away to the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="419">You tried to join the Army, you kind of got caught underneath the Russian occupation and then you made your way back to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brzeznica</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Is that right? </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And then I’m a little bit confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">You mentioned that you were working in an S, were you working in an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">SS camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Was it a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> for Jews that you were working in? </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Okay, what was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="460">QUESTION:  When was it that you organized that <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">ANSWER:  In 1940 already. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">The end of 1940 I organized it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And what could I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="464">If somebody has toothache, I could help, or to make an extraction, to pull out a tooth. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And that was the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">There was no other things, no fillings. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I had to make fillings only when an SS man didn’t want to go to the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">They were not allowed to go to a Jewish dentist, not to a Polish even, nor to a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">They had to go to an SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">But they knew that they will have a special treatment at the Jewish dentist, so some of them came. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And that was a very difficult task, because I didn’t have, I didn’t have this equipment, which the German have. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">The German has the most modern and the most equipment. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">The SS had the most modern. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And there was a lot of cases, which I couldn’t treat them at all, and I send them to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">But they were insisting, they were insisting. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And so in beginning, that was about a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I had an ID, SS ID, that I could come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> was standing, I show only the ID and I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">In the beginning the doctors were also leaving, living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And coming only to work there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="706">ANSWER:  I recommended to my commandant, I recommended my commandant to accept him. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I also accepted the other one, who became the priest, the anti-Semite, which was. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And this Muschau was a very nice man, very nice man. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">And he was not like the common peasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">He was already more civilized because he was working in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> as a miner, several years. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And he came up from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="712">He brought some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And he was already more progressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And we exchanged different opinions about the situation, the political situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">About the Germans, about the Russians, so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">We were politicizing. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">He was inviting me in his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="718">We are drinking and eating there. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And he invite the neighbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">He has a neighbor there, one Kilbasa (ph), who came also and they want to hear what happens in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And I have also some news from my fellow man. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">So they accepted all the news from me as an intelligent Polish officer and Polish patriot, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And that was always, with the alcohol, with moonshine. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I drank moonshine in my life, maybe I could make a bath in it and swim.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">QUESTION:  Was that hard to get used to? </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Drinking that much without slipping when you were drunk? </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I mean, letting something slip?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">ANSWER:  I never allowed to be drunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I always want to have my clear mind, because that was the most dangerous thing, to lose your mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">To be drunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">So when I felt, I run it out somewhere, I make like I am drinking another one, another one, but I didn’t drink it. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">But still it was quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I am happy that I could tolerate it as much as I could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">QUESTION:  What happened towards the end of the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Did you have, you had information about what was happening through your involvement with the AK that you knew where the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> was and whether they were advancing and so forth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">ANSWER:  Well you could hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">First of all, there was a situation about four months, more than four months. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">The Russians stopped on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , they didn’t cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Vistula</span> to help the Polish resistance, the Uprising in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> for political reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">They want the Poles to be annihilated by the Germans and then will go and kill the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">That was a very courageous thing to make from the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="741">But that was a very, very bad thing instead to help to fight the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">The Germans killed a lot of Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And of course, a lot between them the Jewish, which were fighting with the Poles, from the rest which remained there between the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And we have all the news about the uprisings. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">There was, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> where the commandant, ours, was sitting, they had a radio, which they are listening to Radio London, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , BBC, they have all the news and the movements of the Russian Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And I knew in one day they brought to me, two English pilots, who escaped from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German camp</span> , and I had to transport them to the Russians, because the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> had <span class="BUILDING">air bases</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Because the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> were already allies with the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And I was already, I said already good bye to Fryda and I was already on the way to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">But in the meantime when they came to the next <span class="BUILDING">base</span> they told me not to go farther because the <span class="DLF">field</span> are mined everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I will not be able to cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">So I left them at this Polish unit there AK where I brought them there and I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fryda</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And we are waiting the other four months and then you didn’t need the knowledge, 17 you heared the bombardment with the Russians started on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> there, from a distance to bombard artillery. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And then they started to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And so we became so-called liberated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="756">QUESTION:  One second before we go on, I just want to make sure I understand your... So, you were involved with the AK, but you were also working on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Is that right? </span><span class="sentence" id="758">So how did you? </span><span class="sentence" id="759">When did you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="760">ANSWER:  In the night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="761">QUESTION:  Oh, at night time you worked with the AK?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="772">QUESTION:  Did the people who were sheltering you know that you were working...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="773">ANSWER:  Oh no. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">They knew that Iam AK, and that I am officer, but no, they are not suspicious that I am Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Because the son, which is studying for priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">He was by himself, he said, if I will catch a Jew, I will cut in pieces and they should salt on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">As I said, he was a very, very bad anti-Semite. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">His parents were not anti-Semites. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">They were very simple peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">They didn’t understand and think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Well, they boarded Jews and they went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetl</span> , they had their acquaintance with Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">But of course they preferred, they loved the Polish and the Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">It 1s normal, it is normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">But they didn’t hate especially the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">But the son, which was already studying priesthood and they knew already, they told him already, at this time they were still teaching that the Jews killed Jesus and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">So, this young priest, no wonder that he hated Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">That was indoctrinated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">QUESTION:  So you mentioned the “so-called” liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Did you feel in any way as if you were free?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="791">ANSWER:  It was a very, very, very mixed feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">On one <span class="NPIP">side</span> you felt the Russians are coming, you will not be more in danger as a Pole, but as a Jew, you continue to be in danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And then came the reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">You find out what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">Because until now, you heared only, they killed here, they killed here, they killed here. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">But the disaster so big, you realized only slowly when you were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">When you came to the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , which has before the war, in the war even, in the beginning, ninety thousand Jews and you barely find five or six people which are Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">That was a trauma which you couldn’t, you couldn’t hand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">You were, and you were asking by yourself, why me? </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Why didn’t Anna do what I did? </span><span class="sentence" id="801">You start to analyze and to understand and those are things that you cannot understand until today. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Because there were wiser people than me, speaking Polish better than me or the same like me, having connection with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Why didn’t they survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Why didn’t they choose our way? </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Was it right we did? </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And what is the 18 role we have to play by being alive?

class="sentence" id="1056">And I start to organize a practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">And I had first of all, aroom to sleep, a nice <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to sleep with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> , quite a nice <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and a nice <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">And that was for the moment a wonderful solution. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">But I started to think, “If he did it, 22 maybe I can do the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">I will go to the German occupied, German-Polish occupied territories, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> occupies <span class="REGION">German

class="sentence" id="1062">And to live there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">And I went there, but I didn’t find nothing which I would like. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">So I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fryda</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">We met there another guy, a survivor who was already working for the Polish security, in the Polish security. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">He wrote a book about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">He lives here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">He became a very rich guy here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">And he became an officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">He survived in his <span

somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">And he was in this part which became occupied by the Russians first, the first month there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">And the Polish units there sent him to an <span class="BUILDING">officer’s school</span> and he became an officer 1n the Polish security. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">And then when the Russians moved, he moved with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">He came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">And he make a lot of, find a lot of Polish people whom, whom he gave over to, handed over to the Polish security. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">But while the Russians occupied the <span class="REGION">German part</span> , they sent him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wroclaw</span> as an officer there of their security. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">And then they send him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lidnice</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lidnitz</span> , where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">And where I was looking for some dental equipment, he was working 1n his job to look for Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">And we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">And we make a recognition as a Jew and he as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">We didn’t talk too much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">He said, “What can I do for you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">I said, “You can help me to find some...” He said, he’ Il try.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1086">QUESTION:  How did you, let me just interrupt briefly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">How did you make that recognition? </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">Was there some special way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1089">ANSWER:  Well, I recognize him as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">His name was Polish, Zalewski (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">And when I met him, I said, “Zaleski, but what is your real name?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">And he was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> , which was not far from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , about twelve kilometer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">That’s about eight miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">It was quite close. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">And I knew people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">And he told me, “My name is Zalschitz (ph), Nafthali Zalschitz.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And he was called Tadek Zalewski, Tadeusz Zalewski (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">But I left Fryda with him, and I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> to see how to organize life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">I found some instrument which I can use there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">And when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , I found this, I have to go, well I mix up because I don’t go chronological. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">Before we left I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to take Father, her father from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1102">QUESTION:  You went actually to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1103">ANSWER:  It was no more <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp there</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="1104">Phone rings.] </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">It was liberated by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">That was a card we have that he was there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1107">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1108">ANSWER:  So I went there with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian trucks</span> , I went there with taking ammunition to the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">There was still war, but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was already liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">And he was the one who remained in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there because he couldn’t go farther. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">And he said better, they ask to leave, but he said he preferred to stay here to be burned and not to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And they shoot all the other people who went there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1115">QUESTION:  Okay, did you know, did you know what had happened at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1116">ANSWER:  Well, I knew from Polish accounting, but when I came there I found everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">I found everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">And when I saw him, I had all the history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">That was a man who was taller than me and he was fifty-six pounds, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">I took in a blanket a heap of bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">And I was waiting for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to take him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">But that was before we left to the <span class="REGION">occupied territories</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">And Fryda took care of him, and he came to his quite normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">But that was already February when we left for... even more later, maybe March already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">It is difficult now to remember the dates exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">So we left Father in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">We left to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">And we went to look for, find some existence there with the idea maybe we’ll take him over there to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1129">QUESTION:  Can we go back? </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">I know you already did go forward, but go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> experience and what you... you mentioned you really discovered what had gone on when you were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">What did you experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1132">ANSWER:  Not too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">All what Father-in-law told us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">I didn’t have the time and the courage to go to look what happens around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">But he had enough to recount his stories of what happens during the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">But on the way back from this <span class="REGION">occupied territory</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , I have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">And I have broken my leg, my hand here, and I was taken to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> instead to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">Somehow I could let know Fryda that I am in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">That was everything through people, which are communicating, commuting there and back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">So, she came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">She decided to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">She didn’t have money, not even for to pay the Russians to give the vodka for commuting with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">But while she was at this friend’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , he became our good friend, this officer, this Tadek Zalewski. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">His wife, she was Jewish too, she survived also on Christian papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">She said, “T can’t give you anything money.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">She want to give her some jewelry, but Fryda didn’t want to take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">But while she was sleeping, she put in her bag a golden bracelet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">And Fryda when she got up, she said, “What is this yet? </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">I didn’t have a bracelet.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">She said, “Take it, you’Il need it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">Take it, youll need it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">I don’t need it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">Someday you’ll pay me back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">I don’t remember if she took it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">I guess she took it and she came back to me, to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And she had to take care of this poor father and of this poor husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">In the meantime, we got connection by mail with a brother of her father, an uncle, Uncle Solomon in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And when he heard that his brother survived, that we survived, he open... in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , an open account. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1159">How much you need, you can have and take.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">And there was the connection who gave us the possibility to survive further. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">But that was already a few months later, because mail didn’t function so easy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1162">QUESTION:  At that time were you really thinking that you wanted to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> permanently?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1163">ANSWER:  Well, I didn’t think so much about <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">I didn’t want to stay with the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">I knew the Russians before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> I wouldn’t mind, even, to stay, because I had my roots there, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">With all minuses I thought I would be able to organize a good life in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , even I thought in my dreams, on our <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">I said, I will keep the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">I'll keep a <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> there, help the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">And having a nice living on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">I love the <span class="DLF">farm</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">We have a big <span class="DLF">farm</span> , a nice <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And it was the nicest <span class="DLF">farm</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">I thought sometimes that will be okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">But when I thought about the Russians and the system of their, when they bring in, I would not have 24 the <span class="DLF">farm</span> and I would not have my freedom so I start to think to move from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">Somewhere, the nearest approach was to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , where Fryda has a brother of her father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">In the beginning we want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because one of my brothers, who lives now in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , came to visit us in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">He couldn’t take us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">When he came only for two or three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">And he saw our misery there and he tried to help us what he could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">And he said, “Come in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> we have <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">You’ll make a living there for time being. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">Come there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And we found a way where they were repatriating German families from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">So there was a woman, she came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">She was making all kind of businesses, a Jewish woman from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">And she had the connection how to organize, to join people who want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with the German repatriates. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">We left our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> , which was on the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">But when we came there, we were there two days, there was no transport going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">They already, the last transport left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">And you have to wait another month or two and I couldn’t wait in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> there, so we decided to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> we stayed there until, I guess it was August, I guess, when we find a connection which somebody make passports with a visa to <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span> for five hundred dollar each passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">And the uncle from <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> gave us the money and we paid thousand five hundred. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">But we could get a transit visa through <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , because there was no straight flights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">There was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flight</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">You have to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">And from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> you could have gone to a flyer, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">But when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , we remained in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">And we stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> for five years.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1210">ANSWER:  To be candid, we in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , it’s more my nephews, organized a Zionist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">And I was quasi a member of this organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">But my brother was an active member and he even made ha-shorah (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">He was a farmer and he wanted to go before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">But my mother, even before the war, somehow she said, “There is no future in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> for Jews, let us go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">It was not yet <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , still <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">Said, “You are a farmer,” she said to father, “and the farmers are well off there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">It was another kind of farming there. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1218">We will make somehow money here from our <span class="DLF">farm</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">We could make then, that was a lot of money for our <span class="DLF">farm</span> , ten thousand dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">With ten thousand dollars in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> you could do a lot, you could do a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">But my father said, “No, I don’t want.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">He was much older than my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">My mother was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">With so many children he said, “I’m sure it will be difficult and impossible to make existence there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">And he didn’t want to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">He was orthodox Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">He said, “I will go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> when Messiah will come.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">No Zionists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">And my brother was prepared to go, but then there came the war and he couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">And so my nephews wanted to go and no one of them did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">25 End of Tape 3, Side A 26 Tape 3, Side B
QUESTION:  Okay, it’s now May 30, 2000, and we’re continuing our interview with Mr. Oscar Haber. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And why don’t we start by going back, you had talked on the last tape about the day of your liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">And just to remind you, what you had talked about, we were, you talked about how afterwards you had met up with some other Jews and you were singing some old Yiddish songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">And then you described going back to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and then back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">The thing that I wasn’t sure about, that I didn’t quite understand is, did you immediately leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where you were after liberation? </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">And do you remember saying good-bye to the family that you were staying with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1237">ANSWER:  Well, the question of liberation is one of the most difficult time from all the past problems which we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">We were, as I told you, living as Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">And the liberation came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">We couldn’t enjoy our liberation or <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">It was the greatest shock and the most difficult moment in our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">That was the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">And especially if I want to put it in perspective, the differences between people who survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and people who lived on so-called Aryan papers was very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">We have two things to overcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">The first 1s, which we had all the time, that was the fight for existence and how to survive, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">And the next, when the liberation came was the shock to find the reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">You don’t have where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">You couldn’t find nobody you know, or anybody of your people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">You suddenly find yourself, you cannot stay in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where you were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">We were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , not ina <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">We were ina <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">And if I... realize it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hostage village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">They were not sympathetic to Jewish survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">However I survived, not a Jew, but suddenly I felt that Iam back a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">But I couldn’t officially declare it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">I had to stay on my Aryan papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">And how to go and where to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">Because to go to my other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where I was born there, I wasn’t sure that I will be accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">And I wasn’t sure to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , for example, because I didn’t have where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">Even not where to sleep at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">And you don’t have money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">And you don’t have nothing because whatever you had you have already sold out whatever you had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">So, that was the most terrible time in all this events which we had, the so- called liberation was the terrible hit of the reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">You were hit with the reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">Not where to go and not what to do and how to start. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">Will you be accepted as a Jew? </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">You cannot go on and to say you are not a Jew, because really where you go they know you are Jew when you come to the <span class="NPIP">places</span> where I used to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">And to stay in a strange, foreign surrounding like we were before, so I have to stay like I was all the time, a peasant, a farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">To watch the horse and the cows. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">In reality I was a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">I want to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">I didn’t have nothing with me, but I have to go to start to look for our existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">And as I said before already that part, I went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where I was born, and then later when they went with us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , all this trouble I have with Fryda and when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">But the question of this liberation, to explain it in a very simple term, that was the greatest shock of everything together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">But when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , when I started to settle as I said, I have been there, different <span class="NPIP">places</span> , start to organize my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">And with the help of the uncle which came, we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> as I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> we became refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">We became as one of the United Nations refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">We registered there and I have my register card as a refugee from the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">And I got the permit because I had a visa only to stay there, transit visa to pass through <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">But because I was recognized as a refugee, they gave me time to stay three months there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">In three months I had to renew my stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">And we were under the auspicion of the foreign police, a special department, the etranger (ph), police etranger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">And they gave us another stay of three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">27
QUESTION:  Okay, before we go on into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , I just wanted to ask another question about the liberation time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">I’ve forgotten the name of the family that was sheltering you right at the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">What was their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1288">ANSWER:  The Polish people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1289">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1290">ANSWER:  Soltys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">Soltys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">That was a woman, a widow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1293">QUESTION:  They were the ones in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">But at the time of the liberation what was the name of the woman that you were staying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1295">ANSWER:  Oh that was a man, that was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muschau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">He was recognized as a righteous man, the righteous between people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">I gave him to Yad Vashem, and he is recognized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">He was a wonderful person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">He helped us all the time, even the time when he didn’t suspect us as Jews, he was all the time very human and very helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1300">QUESTION:  I thought you were staying with his sister right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">You were actually staying with him right at the end of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1302">ANSWER:  We stayed with the sister, but it was a very terrible accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">The last, the last bullet, the Russian bullet got his hand, his left hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">Because his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was on the, on the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">Where the front was standing between the Russians and the Germans and there was heavy fire because there was the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Dunajec river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">And he was close to this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , not far. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">So he decided, the frontier between the Germans and the Russians, which was standing about four or five months was very close to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">And his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was under fire, so he decided to come to his sister place, and while he opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , a bullet cut his left hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">And he was bleeding and because he knew that the <span class="BUILDING">underground station</span> , <span class="BUILDING">sanitary station</span> was in my <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so he decided that the neighbor took him on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and he brought him to me there to give him first help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">And I cut him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">It was hanging on the skin, this hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">I cut on this and I bind around that he doesn’t bleed out and I went back with him together and brought him to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">And there I found out a really surgeon doctor was hiding there in the underground army and they brought him to this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">I gave him the anesthesia, whichever it could be a little bit chloroform. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">But most anesthesia was I gave him alcohol. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">We had there moonshine, moonshine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">And he was drinking so he was out of conscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">And this surgeon bind him, all these veins and arteries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">First of all, he cut him a little bit of this arm farther because it was already gangrenous, gangrene, because where I bound it there it started, it is very fast process. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">He cut it there and bind all the arteries and veins and so he survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">And then I didn’t go more to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> of the sister, but I stayed with him and took care on him all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">So he survived and he was thankful to me and I was very thankful to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">So it was a very, very good occasion to serve this man, this very nice person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1324">QUESTION:  Was Fryda with you then too? </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">With him? </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">28
ANSWER:  No, for the first two days she stayed still with the sister there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">But later on she came here, we brought here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">The front was standing there fora moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">There was a fight there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">The Germans run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">They left only some guns, automatic shooters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">And these were not origin Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">This were Russians which were collaborated with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">And they were making the last fights with the German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">And there in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> just, we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">The Germans caught the first Russian soldiers who came in, and they bind them together and they put a grenade between them and they kill them there, on the garbage there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1337">QUESTION:  Did you see that happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1338">ANSWER:  I saw it later, after I saw them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">The Germans came in, you can come take in the shoes if you need from this people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">And then the Germans escape, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">That was the end of this fight there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">And after several days we went there, to the sister there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">We took a little bit of what we had, our clothings and we left there, from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">And then we are looking on occasion somehow to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> and to go to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> there and to organize this life like I said.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1345">QUESTION:  But even though the war had ended and you were supposedly liberated, you didn’t tell these people that you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1346">ANSWER:  No, I didn’t tell them and for a long time they didn’t know, until... I don’t know exactly when they started to realize that I am Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">But when the war passed my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where I was, the war continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">It was January twenty-one and the war was continued until, as you know, until May. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">So here was all the time moving <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian trucks</span> and armaments and soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">That was the only way, with the soldiers for a bottle of vodka, which we could have some commuting to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> or to the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">It was also very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">They were also not very sympathetic to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">Sometimes Fryda stand in the <span class="DLF">line</span> to get a ride to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> there for some food to these Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">So there was standing a lot of people and waiting for this ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">So the Russian driver which was taking said, “You yes, you can go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">You yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">But you no, no Jews, no Jews, no Jews.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">Even the Russian soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">So there is no big difference between one and the other one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1360">QUESTION:  So you really didn’t feel then that the Russians were any safer to live with than the Germans had been?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1361">ANSWER:  First of all, they didn’t realize who is a Jew or no, except that they really recognize by physiognomy, they saw it is a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">And then in reality they were not more, well they didn’t have in their program to kill Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">That was individual soldiers, some of them which were, I don’t know, they were from some other nationality as Russians or Ukrainians or Belorussians or Lithuanians or Latvians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">There were all kinds of soldiers there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">So that was more individual and then it was also sometimes inspired by some other anti-Semites to go to kill a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">The Russians didn’t hesitate to kill a Jew, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">However it came in the Polish Army, which was a Polish unit in the Russian Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">In this unit there were many Jews, I mean for us, many... five was many. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">Because we used already without Jews here in this <span class="NPIP">side</span> , the <span class="REGION">German side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">But there were some Jews and the times when the Jews didn’t hear, you could hear... I understand Russian and Ukrainian, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">So, I could hear how they were expressing themselves anti-Semitic even to their officers and to their sergeants. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1372">These dirty Jews,” and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">So this is the reality like it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">29
QUESTION:  Okay, then you were saying a little earlier about <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">And you were there as refugees and you had to be registered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1376">ANSWER:  In this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , I came to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where I was origin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">And I told you already before in this story, that they send in somebody to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">And I didn’t go back there to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">Fryda went several times for food, but she never slept there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">She went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetl</span> and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetl</span> were already three or four Jewish families. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">And between them was one, my niece, she lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">She came there back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetl</span> there, and she had already a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there and she slept with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">And the next day she came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">When she left I wasn’t sure I will see her tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">It was a difficult time even after the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">Even after the liberation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1387">QUESTION:  You mentioned last time about the group of people, the group of survivors that you were together with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">Where was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1389">ANSWER:  That was already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">Well, you cannot say group, they formed a group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">They find each other and because one of them has a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so we came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">We could there sleep at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">And with no soldier, we were sitting and singing old Yiddish songs because we couldn’t sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">The horror on our heads was so terrible that we couldn’t sleep even. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">Like taking, by the time, how to spend the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1396">QUESTION:  Were these people that you had known before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1397">ANSWER:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">I never knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">I never knew these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">I never knew these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">That was only two or three days, until, as I told you, we find the place of my friends there, which they were already coming survivors from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> after the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">Young people which were living together there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">Sleeping there on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> for a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">Somehow that you have, because in the evening there was curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">You couldn’t go in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , you have to be someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">So that was the place where we could run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">And that was a very happy occasion to go in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1408">QUESTION:  Okay, do you want to skip ahead then and talk about <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">Because we talked, that’s where we left off.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1538">ANSWER:  Well maybe it is not known in the world and people are more concentrated on <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and Polish anti-Semites in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">But <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , which seems to be more sympathetic to the Jewish case... in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , where there was quite a number of Jews, when you were looking for an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for rent, it was in the <span class="DLF">windows</span> written, “Not for foreigners.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">And that meant not for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">In some of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> was written exactly what I said, “No Jews.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">And I in the meantime learned to speak Flemish, which was the language in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> was more French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flandria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">That was the the part of... <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> has two nations, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valonia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flandria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">The Flandrians were more, more German sympathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">They were German oriented. </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">Valonians were more French oriented. </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">And Jews which were saved in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , they mostly were more saved in this part which was Valonian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flandria</span> there was impossible to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">We came, rented an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">And still we were all the time renting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">And that was a nice <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">We love it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">And the administrator showed us the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and the conditions where it was not expensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">It was nice and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">And when it came to write the lease, he says, “Yes, but you are not strangers.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">And we said, “Yes, we are strangers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">We are from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">And he said, “But you are not Jews?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">I said, “Yes, we are Jews.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">So, “I am sorry, I have instructions from my... I am not the owner, from the owner, no Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">I am sorry, no Jews.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">And that gave me a lot to think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">Around you see no friends, no friendly, no foreigners, no Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">So that means there is no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live here for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">However there is a lot Jews remained there and lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">They didn’t care about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">But I was, I don’t know, personally more sensitive realizing this problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">I said, “No, I don’t want to be, that can happen the same everywhere.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">And therefore I decided to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">I said, “That’s the one <span class="NPIP">place</span> where nobody would tell me as a Jew you have to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">You have all the rights.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">And that was the reason.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1678">ANSWER:  Well, this question is a very sensitive question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1679">When you came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , how difficult it 1s to say, there was a gap between these born Israelis, long living in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and newcomers in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1680">Like everywhere, a stranger gets feeling of a stranger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1681">You are a stranger for a while until you are not accommodating to the reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="1682">And then some <span class="DLF">gap</span> , some <span class="DLF">gap</span> , it is sixty years after establishment of Israel state, fifty-two years, but there’s still differences between born Israelis, longest living Israelis and new coming Israelis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1683">Is it good? </span><span class="sentence" id="1684">It is reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="1685">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1686">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1687">Maybe it is human nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="1688">It’s this kind of jealousy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1689">But in the beginning when you came in, the feeling was a little bit different, because a lot of people in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , living in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , not born in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but living in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for many years, who were the elite in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , maybe <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1690">Some came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1691">Zionists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1692">They felt the elite, 35 and you felt when you came in with a feeling how could you survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="1693">You must have done something which 1s not right, that you could survive the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1694">Because my parents, my uncle, my grandparents, my brother, my sister, they were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1695">Everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1696">Nobody is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1697">And you survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1698">You must be guilt of something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1699">You have to feel this guilt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1700">QUESTION:  Did people actually say that to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1701">ANSWER:  I heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1702">It wasn’t meant maybe special straight to me, but I heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1703">I heard it in a quite clear voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1704">These people who survive, they were collaborating with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1705">And that gave you a very, very strange feeling, very bad feeling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1706">QUESTION:  Will you say a little bit more about how you dealt with that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1707">I mean you had such high hopes of finding a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where you would really be at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1708">Did you, how did you deal with it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1709">ANSWER:  I was maybe more fortunate than the majority of this newcomers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1710">First of all, because I was involved in the Zionist organization and secondly because I knew the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="1711">And that gave me a very great advantage not to be singled out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1712">That was worse with people who couldn’t communicate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1713">And they had to communicate in other language, which was in Yiddish or in German, and the Israeli-born children didn’t speak Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1714">They didn’t want to speak Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1715">I think they’re quite chauvinistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1716">I think they are quite chauvinistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1717">And the same thing can be said about the long living in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1718">They were maybe not so chauvinistic as they were the best one, the good one. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1719">We came here and we built this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1720">We fought for this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and we gave us acountry.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1721">You know, that was also a very strange feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1722">A very strange feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1723">But with the time you got used to all kind of treatment in your society. </span><span class="sentence" id="1724">End of Tape 4, Side A 36 Tape 4, Side B
QUESTION:  This is tape four, side B. Who were your friends then, mostly other refugees when you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1725">ANSWER:  It’s not only me, but usually people are always closer to their landsmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1726">Coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , get with the Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1727">Coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , are living with the Hungarians because of the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">I cannot say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1729">We had people from different, from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">And in reality, the most educated people which we met in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , which were the leading intelligentsia in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , they were original from these <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">From <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">Because the aliyah which came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> from the <span class="REGION">Arab countries</span> , they were merchandise mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1733">Very, very, very few which were professionals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1734">They all business men, all handy people, making something for a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="1735">But in general, there were the poor people who came, that were the first who came into <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1736">That was the big problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">They didn’t have the language and they didn’t have the... for them life was very difficult when they came poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1738">So there was difficult for <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1739">They built <span class="BUILDING">temporary shelters</span> for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1740">And they were living in these <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> for several years until they somehow came out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1741">There are some of them living until today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1742">Some of them built <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> on the <span class="NPIP">places</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">shelter houses</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1743">They allowed them to build, so they gave them... because most of the <span class="REGION">land</span> were belonging to the Keren Kayemeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1744">So they allowed them, these people to settle on this <span class="NPIP">places</span> because the government wasn’t able to give them stable living. </span><span class="sentence" id="1745">So there are some slobs until today and there are some which built nice <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1746">And of course, with the time, the new generation there went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and they make progress. </span><span class="sentence" id="1747">And a lot of them came with their religious leaders, with their Rabbis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1748">And then they settled in their own circles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1749">And this is now <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ’s greatest problem, is their religious Orthodox problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1750">With the Sephardic, Sephardic those are those, Sephardic in reality means the Spanish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1751">They don’t have nothing to do with Spanish, except maybe their ancestors came from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1752">But generally they are Arabic Jews and they learn quite fast, Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1753">And they arrange their life very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1754">And they make terrible progress, very, very nice progress. </span><span class="sentence" id="1755">But the problem of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> is not solved and will never be solved in my opinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1756">That’s war... my son, for example, was in two big wars, in the Six- Day War and the Yom Kippur War. </span><span class="sentence" id="1757">And that was one of the main reasons that he left <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1758">He said he had enough of wars, when he came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> for studying his business, so he found that he would be better here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1759">And he stayed here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1760">And therefore we are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1761">We came after him, otherwise we wouldn’t be here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1762">I would be here in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> until today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1763">And I’m not sorry that I did it, because I’m not sorry of one step in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1764">I don’t look backwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1765">I take the reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="1766">Iam here happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1767">I live happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1768">And so is my son. </span><span class="sentence" id="1769">I have two grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="1770">My granddaughter graduated now from the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> here in <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1771">But she lives also to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Austin</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , where my son lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1772">And our grandson is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Virginia Beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1773">So now we are without children and without grandchildren, but we have here very good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1774">And we are happy here, making our life here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1775">QUESTION:  When your son was growing up in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> did he ask you about your past and about the Holocaust years? </span><span class="sentence" id="1776">Or did you tell him about what had happened there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1777">ANSWER:  Well the first years, I myself couldn’t talk about it, neither could my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1778">And she 1s until today not so outspoken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1779">And for her the language barrier in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was very difficult, very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1780">37 She learned the daily language, but usually she couldn’t live a cultural life, except going to <span class="BUILDING">concert</span> and eventually from time to time with me to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1781">But usually it was a barrier for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1782">But we have a society where she could speak Polish, where she could speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1783">And we had very wonderful company, very good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1784">And then concerning our son, it came when he went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , to <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1785">He asked in the first grade, he asked about whether we could help him with something in his homework. </span><span class="sentence" id="1786">And mother told him, “I’m sorry but go to Father because I don’t know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1787">So he ask a very simple question, “Mom, did you ever go in your life to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1788">So it is difficult to say that we spoke with him about the Holocaust because it was a painful thing to go on to put it on your children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1789">But of course when he growed up, when he went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and later on to military, he realized what happened and he asked some questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1790">But not too many, not too many, not too many. </span><span class="sentence" id="1791">And I think until we came here, to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , he learned more about all of this than all his staying in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1792">QUESTION:  So it wasn’t so much a part of cultural life in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> then to even talk about it, even though it’s a society mostly composed of Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="1793">People weren’t, the children weren’t being taught necessarily about what had happened in Europe with the Nazis’ extermination of Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1794">ANSWER:  Well, I, I cannot agree with this what you ask for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1795">My culture life in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was very, very developed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1796">First of all in the professional way because I was very active in my profession and I studied a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1797">And except of which I went to concert and I went to <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , all <span class="BUILDING">Jewish theater</span> , I mean <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1798">I understood and I could take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1799">And then I had a very rich <span class="BUILDING">library</span> in Hebrew language and I was reading in Hebrew and for me Hebrew became my, really to say, my first, or my second language if I would say the truth, because the first always remains the Polish language which you have your basic education.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1800">QUESTION:  My question was more about whether your son, your son was... or even in this, I would maybe have guessed that in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> he would have been taught about the Holocaust because he’s living in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1801">But from what you’re saying it sounds as if there was not very much talk about the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1802">ANSWER:  You are right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1803">In the first maybe ten years there was no talk about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1804">Later on bit by bit it came out and they start to open more the world and exchange of knowledge of the world, with all other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in Europe and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1805">And the Jews from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , tourists used to come, family members looking, searching for family and some of them finding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1806">And there was always exposed to the Israeli informations in the papers and everywhere that was always the corner, the sensitive corner of Jewish life, to find families, far families and families and friends from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetl</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1807">Here they found a sister, here they found a brother after not knowing that they survived, because they disappeared and they went to different corners of the world, to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">New Zealand</span> and to <span class="REGION">Africa</span> and wherever you want, you have everywhere people in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1808">So when they start to come somehow together it was more exposed in the reality of course, with this knowledge it came always a history and development of knowledge about Holocaust, how it came to it, and this opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> to more knowledge about the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1809">QUESTION:  How long did you live, oh, here’s what I wanted to ask you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1810">How segregated were you from your Arab neighbors? </span><span class="sentence" id="1811">Did you have any interaction with them at all? </span><span class="sentence" id="1812">Or were your lives just completely separate? </span><span class="sentence" id="1813">38
ANSWER:  My personal life was never involved with any Arabs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1814">With any Arabs, I didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1815">Well, I can say that I knew nothing, but from the press and visiting to go to the South to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beersheba</span> and passing some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> where Arabs was living going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nazareth</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1816">If you go to see the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , you met the Arabs and their way of living. </span><span class="sentence" id="1817">But in my <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I lived there was no Arabs at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1818">At that given time there was no Arabs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1819">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , for example, there was a section which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaffa</span> , the port of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaffa</span> , the old port of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaffa</span> is the oldest <span class="DLF">port</span> in the Mediterranean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1820">There are living Arabs until today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1821">The majority of them are Arabs and they are Christian Arabs and there are Muslim Arabs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1822">There are <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> , there are <span class="BUILDING">mosques</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1823">So when you are going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , because there is not separation between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Givataim</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Givataim</span> was on the rand (ph) of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , that’s like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1824">And then when you want to go for a good meal, you went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaffa</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1825">Good <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1826">Were <span class="BUILDING">Arab restaurants</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1827">And Oriental Jews opened <span class="BUILDING">oriental restaurants</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1828">So this is the way where you came together with the Arab world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1829">You want to go to buy some fresh fish in the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1830">So you could buy it at Arab fishers there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1831">There were Jewish fishers, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1832">But generally we didn’t have any, any, any connection and live together with the Arabs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1833">We knew from the press and we knew from the medias how they live and where they live and what their problems are, but we didn’t have nothing in common, nothing in common. </span><span class="sentence" id="1834">You came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , of course, after the Liberation, I mean after the Six-Day War there, western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> which they annected. </span><span class="sentence" id="1835">So you learned something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1836">When you came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> before when it was divided, you came always to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , where we saw the Arabs here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1837">It was always a danger to approach close because there were shootings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1838">QUESTION:  When did you first go back to visit <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1839">ANSWER:  I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> after, to be exact, about after fifty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1840">QUESTION:  Fifty?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1841">ANSWER:  After fifty years I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1842">The second time I went after three years.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1846">ANSWER:  We decide to go, when the parents of our good friends which live here in <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> came to visit here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1847">It was a very old Krakow family which knew the business of Fryda’s parents and he by himself helped one Jew to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1848">And they are very, very nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1849">We met them and became friendly, very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1850">They really embraced us and they asked us to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , to be their guests there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1851">And to see, you will see it is not so bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1852">Just try, come and you will see your sights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1853">That was one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1854">The other thing was we wanted to see our savior, this Muschau, who got his righteous papers there, and his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1855">We wanted to see him because he was older than we are and we wanted to see him alive still. </span><span class="sentence" id="1856">We supported him from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1857">We were sending parcels and money from time to time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1858">And we supported him and he was very 39 thankful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1859">They were not rich people, very poor peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="1860">And he also wrote us that he will be happy to see us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1861">So we decided we will go, we will see how it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1862">We went there and as I told you maybe before, I was a member of Rotary International in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and I became a member of Rotary here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lexington</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1863">And as a Rotarian you are obliged to visit a club wherever you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1864">You should go to meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1865">Rotary have to come together, whoever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1866">The Rotary in principle, Rotary has to have the best people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1867">That’s what the principle of Rotary is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1868">And we went there to see Rotary in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> on their meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1869">And one of the members was a Jesuit priest, who was a professor at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1870">And he was a doctor of biology and a doctor of philosophy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1871">A very bright person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1872">After I had my speech there, at <span class="BUILDING">Rotary</span> they are always asking guest Rotarian to give his impression and his greetings from his club to bring there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1873">He came to me, and we became very friendly, very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1874">So that even when I came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , we were writing to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1875">I have maybe fifty letters from him, which he wrote to me and I wrote to him exchanging of some ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1876">He was very fond of the Jewish religion and of Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="1877">Which I, I have studied a lot about Judaism, biblical Judaism and Talmudic Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="1878">So I could give him some answers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1879">We had some very, very interesting talks about this subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="1880">We had a very good time there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1881">We went there to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1882">One of our Polish friends which we became friendly, he visited here with the <span class="BUILDING">University of Kentucky</span> for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1883">We became friendly and he invited to visit him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1884">And he went with his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with us to these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> where we used to be in hiding there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1885">And we went there and met the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1886">There was a very exciting experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1887">And we really enjoyed to see this everything from perspective, it gives us some good feeling that we could do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1888">And therefore we went for the second time, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1889">QUESTION:  Had you kept in touch with anybody in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> apart from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muschau</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1890">ANSWER:  Yes, we saw <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muschau</span> for himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1891">QUESTION:  No, had you kept in touch with anyone other than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muschau</span> during the years that you were not in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1892">ANSWER:  No, no, not at all, not at all, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1893">Except these people here from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> which we met here and this people who visited here and the Jesuit priest which we visited, otherwise we didn’t have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1894">QUESTION:  So, Mrs. Soltys or her son, did you see them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1895">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, we saw them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1896">We saw both sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1897">They were, well, they were very touched. </span><span class="sentence" id="1898">Madame Soltys didn’t live anymore, she was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1899">The second time we were even the Soltys son, the oldest son passed away, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1900">Only the youngest son, Kazimierz Soltys, which writes us until today and we send him from time to time some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1901">Otherwise no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1902">QUESTION:  What about, there were people who, I assume you had left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they didn’t know at the time that you were Jewish, but you were friendly with them, such as the people who hid you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1903">Did you have any encounters with people like that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1904">40
ANSWER:  No, I didn’t meet more people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1905">I will tell you, I didn’t want these people to have different feelings, that I was Jewish and they couldn’t know and could even help me, maybe they will be sorry that they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1906">I don’t want to put them in this conflict. </span><span class="sentence" id="1907">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1908">You can never know human thinkings, human spirits, human soul. </span><span class="sentence" id="1909">You never know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1910">I don’t want to hurt people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1911">QUESTION:  But overall your visit was very good it sounds like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1912">ANSWER:  Yes, my visit was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1913">Short. </span><span class="sentence" id="1914">Very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1915">Well, we experienced one a very, very peculiar experience while we were walking in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1916">In the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> , in the most important <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , in the most beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> and I am not sure that the person who did it knew that we are Jewish and it wasn’t directed to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1917">I think because this person run away from the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> , screaming, “Death to the Jews.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1918">And that was a very, very strange feeling, very, very strange feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1919">I couldn’t blame my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1920">I couldn’t blame nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1921">Maybe some crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1922">You never know what people are able to do and who they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1923">End of Tape 4, Side B 4] Tape 5, Side A
QUESTION:  This is tape number five, side A of an interview with Oscar Haber. </span><span class="sentence" id="1924">And you wanted to mention about your visit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1925">ANSWER:  Because I was talking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , about the unpleasant what happens to me, I will try to make some remarks about the Sharoka (ph) which 1s called the <span class="DLF">high street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1926">And there is the oldest <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in Europe, called before the world the <span class="BUILDING">Alte Shul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1927">And there is now a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1928">There is another thing there on this <span class="DLF">street</span> , which is one of the oldest, maybe oldest too, maybe in the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1929">I don’t know exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1930">The <span class="BUILDING">Remu Shul</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> which is named after Reb Isserls, which was a Rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> in the, I guess it was in the fifteenth century if I am not wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1931">There is still a <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> and there are still Jews coming and there is a minyan and praying in Shabbas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1932">And they’re of course coming curious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1933">And there is always a meeting of Jews who come visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1934">They are always coming there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1935">And the site of this <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> is the old <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> which a gravestone of this famous Rabbi, Rabbi Isserls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1936">They called the <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> and they called the Rabbi “Remu’. </span><span class="sentence" id="1937">Rabbi Moshe Isserls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1938">About him, used to say, “From Moses, to Moses was not like Moses Isserls.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1939">Was a very great Rabbi, who corrected one of the main Jewish religious books, the Shulchan Aruch, on which the Jews, the Western Jews were living their daily life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1940">That was included every point of life from the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1941">But I will go back to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1942">There are remnants from Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1943">There were several severed Torahs, Bibles, and all kind of religious utilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1944">And last but not least, there are many photos of old Jewish life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1945">And we were there for a Shabbat prayer at the <span class="BUILDING">Remu Synagogue</span> which I mentioned before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1946">And there were a minyan, there were even a group of young students from <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> came to visit <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they were visiting this <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> and sitting all the pray and praying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1947">And another thing which is to see of Jewish life, there is a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish cultural center</span> on the Meilzel (ph) Street. </span><span class="sentence" id="1948">A foundation of Canadian Jew, a , and there are also kind of all Jewish life in the past and the present Jewish life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1949">And they are cultural meetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1950">There are coming writers and meeting there and presenting their books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1951">And there are Jewish books there in this unit there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1952">QUESTION:  Did seeing all of this inspire you at all to, to think about the possibility of Jewish life continuing in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1953">Did you ever consider living there yourself again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1954">ANSWER:  To answer this question 1s not easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1955">From a historical point of view I’m sure Jews will live in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1956">First of all because of the root, of the roots. </span><span class="sentence" id="1957">It may be even second, third, fourth and fifth generation, they have their Jewish ballast, if you want to say, which asks them to go back to the sources. </span><span class="sentence" id="1958">This is one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1959">The second thing 1s, of the globalization of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1960">The world is globalizing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1961">It has united Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1962">In another few years if it will continue this way there will no be <span class="DLF">borders</span> between European countries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1963">It will be a united Europe and Jews are living in Europe and will live in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1964">We have the best example, <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1965">The Jews were driven in the fifteenth century from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and there are Jews living there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1966">There is a Jewish life in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1967">And there will be everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1968">There is Jewish life in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1969">We may not like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1970">We may not want it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1971">But life is stronger than all our views. </span><span class="sentence" id="1972">May it be political, philosophical, whatever it is, life has his right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1973">Bread is easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1974">Where life is easier, people will always go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1975">And that’s my view. </span><span class="sentence" id="1976">Maybe I’m wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1977">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1978">But I am sure and I know that the last visit of the Pope in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> gives a great contribution to somehow living together, Catholics and Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1979">It is maybe ironic that in general even in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , people, Jewish people in general are more 42 involved in general Christianity, maybe less in Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1980">Because there is a minority of Catholics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1981">But <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is ninety percent Catholics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1982">And the Pope, his origin is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wadowice</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1983">And he was during the war behaving as a fellow Semite. </span><span class="sentence" id="1984">And he now with his visit in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and his approach to the problem of Jewish—Christian connection, I think opens more the <span class="DLF">door</span> for Jews to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1985">Maybe I am wrong, maybe I am right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1986">It is still a stereotype of American Jews which have a guilty feeling that they didn’t do nothing, nothing in time of the Holocaust to help their brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1987">That they are putting all the guilt of the Holocaust on Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1988">I know the truth is that the majority of extermination, <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and so forth was in the <span class="REGION">Polish territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1989">But I find my very answer, I think the main reason is that it was much easier for the Germans to make it where the biggest concentration of the Jews were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1990">There was, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was more Jews than all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1991">So instead to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> or to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> or to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , of course they didn’t want to take them because they were ashamed to bring the Jews to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1992">So I mean to this other little <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , to bring million of Jews it was for them impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1993">Impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1994">Physically it was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1995">Maybe it would be good if they had come to this idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1996">But their idea was to do this fast, fast and more able to do it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> That’s my opinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1997">Maybe I am wrong, but that is the reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="1998">And of course, there is something to it that in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> were no many objection to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1999">But there is another answer, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was the biggest country of this all <span class="REGION">occupied territories</span> except <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2000">But <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> has its own Anti-Semitic history, so we can put it in another perspective.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2001">QUESTION:  So, if you knew that you had another hundred years to live, could you conceive of living in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , moving back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> for part of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2002">ANSWER:  It is like I said, it’s a very, very difficult answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="2003">Maybe yes, maybe no. </span><span class="sentence" id="2004">The yes is I would like to be the first one, not the second, not the third, not the fifth. </span><span class="sentence" id="2005">But if I live fifty years and there will be a community of a million Jews, I am not sure if I would not prefer to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2006">Well of course, my first priority is <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but I don’t know what will happen to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in the next future. </span><span class="sentence" id="2007">Iam very worrying and it is one of my greatest pains to think about, about a bad outcome of this situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="2008">I don’t want to be a prophet and I don’t want to put my words in tapes or in history. </span><span class="sentence" id="2009">But I am very afraid of the, what happens in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2010">QUESTION:  How do you feel about life in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2011">ANSWER:  It is the same question like you ask me before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2012">QUESTION:  Hard to answer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2013">ANSWER:  If I am living in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , it is the most wonderful <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="2014">If you ask me to live between Jews and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I am not comfortable with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2015">I was more comfortable in Jews to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2016">And there is a reason to it and it is very difficult to raise out from history the past and the relations between American Jews and world Jewry at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="2017">It is a very difficult task. </span><span class="sentence" id="2018">And even now, with their best will, with their greatest contribution to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> —which 1s a feeling of guilt, of course—the relations between old American Jews and the new American Jews, except this which became very rich and involved in commerce and science and so forth, but the Jewish volks, volks... that means the Jewish Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="2019">The Jewish Jews which 43 are speaking still Jewish, which are reading Jewish books and they have the Jewish folklore and they still have the memory, the heritage of European Jewry, 1s still differentiated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2020">QUESTION:  Do you consider yourself an American now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2021">ANSWER:  Yes, I’m an American, loyal American, a loyal citizen and I know about what happened in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , politically and socially and I am very involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="2022">I mean spiritually, because physically I can’t more. </span><span class="sentence" id="2023">But I was a member and I still am a member, but not so supportive as I was, I am a Republican. </span><span class="sentence" id="2024">I cannot say I don’t like Democrats because they are democratic. </span><span class="sentence" id="2025">But I don’t like Democrats because they are more socialistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="2026">And whatever smells of socialism or communism is for me, a red flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="2027">And this is also a part of my Israeli past, which was the Labor party, which was the priority movement for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="2028">And still they are trying to be, I don’t know what the outcome will be. </span><span class="sentence" id="2029">Barak’ is a Socialist and a member of the Socialist Labor party. </span><span class="sentence" id="2030">And so are many of the desert members. </span><span class="sentence" id="2031">And I don’t like the religious extremists in the same way like I don’t like the liberal extremists. </span><span class="sentence" id="2032">I am used to a middle way, to a way of tolerance and living in harmony with everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2033">QUESTION:  When did you come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2034">ANSWER:  In 1980.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2035">QUESTION:  And did you come directly to <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2036">ANSWER:  Do I come?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2037">QUESTION:  Did you come directly to <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2038">ANSWER:  Yeah, because my son was living in <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> , I came to <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2039">QUESTION:  Do you remember your first impressions of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lexington</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="2075">QUESTION:  You think that women should have the same traditional roles that they had in Orthodox Judaism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2076">ANSWER:  No, they have to have more liberal. </span><span class="sentence" id="2077">But I still cannot accept a woman going to the Rabbi, because it is against the Halachic teachings. </span><span class="sentence" id="2078">I mean, I accept it, but I don’t find it nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="2079">And the teaching there is, if a woman is not clean, she shouldn’t come between the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="2080">She is not clean, that means when she has her menstruation. </span><span class="sentence" id="2081">Only after she goes, she has menstruation, after she finished and take a <span class="INT_SPACE">ritual bath</span> , she is clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="2082">And she is even with everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="2083">I don’t say she is not even, I don’t say this is a dirtiness or an illness, but it’s against the teachings of our sages. </span><span class="sentence" id="2084">And if you go on to take off <span class="DLF">barriers</span> one by one, officially as permissible, you take the balance off Jewish religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="2085">One of the two. </span><span class="sentence" id="2086">You want to be Jewish you have to follow the teachings. </span><span class="sentence" id="2087">Even when you don’t follow, but you don’t have to revolutionize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2088">That what I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="2089">Iam not kosher, for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="2090">I am not doing a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="2091">I am riding on Shabbat. </span><span class="sentence" id="2092">But my opinion it is in those times, Shabbat there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> to ride on Shabbot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2093">There was no electricity to light. </span><span class="sentence" id="2094">There was many things which I found it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2095">But that’s for me, but I don’t say it is permissible. </span><span class="sentence" id="2096">It 1s not permissible, but I find it, I can do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2097">If somebody doesn’t like it, it’s not my problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="2098">It’s his problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="2099">But I can do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2100">I can do everything which I found, in my opinion, it is an answer which is logic.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="2102">ANSWER:  Well, I can say really friends are non-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="2103">This is the majority. </span><span class="sentence" id="2104">Maybe there are some numbers really which I can say they are not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="2105">Three, four families maybe or something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="2106">But not to count as a really friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="2107">These are really the Polish people, which are helping me in need, when I had to go to an emergency, I call to the Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="2108">They come even in the middle of the night and they bring me to Emergency. </span><span class="sentence" id="2109">My wife is not driving and they bring me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2110">I don’t have to go in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2111">And other things also, they are really good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="2112">So, I really don’t differentiate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2113">Because you ask me I say they are accidentally Polish or Christian or Catholics and they are accidentally not. </span><span class="sentence" id="2114">But they are my friends and they are my friends, but not because of they are Polish, because they are Catholics or they are Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="2115">I don’t know if I have even one Catholic, exception of Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="2116">45
QUESTION:  Has it been important to you at all, did it, was it... let me start over. </span><span class="sentence" id="2117">Was it ever important to you to talk about with other people your experiences during the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="2118">Did you get to a point where you felt like I really have to tell people that’s what I experienced and to be around people who understand?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2119">ANSWER:  I was talking several times in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , whoever invite me to give them, I give them my own experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="2120">But there was now a Remembrance day in the <span class="BUILDING">St. Luke church</span> where there are members, two or three Christians which are my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="2121">And they are always counting on me that I will be the speaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="2122">And I for nine years will be making the Remembrance. </span><span class="sentence" id="2123">They make it this year, too and I went to them, I don’t know I show it to you or you have it? </span><span class="sentence" id="2124">No? </span><span class="sentence" id="2125">I promise you to give it to you, my talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="2126">I have to make a copy. </span><span class="sentence" id="2127">I forgot to make a copy. </span><span class="sentence" id="2128">I will give it to you someday if you will ask for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2129">And they make it in such a honorable day that was really a pleasure to talk to these people and to explain to them, this time I spoke generally about the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="2130">In the previous I gave from my personal experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="2131">And they are always anxious and they are...

ANSWER:  Well, you asked me if I spoke to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="2132">I must tell you, to my disappointment... I don’t know, maybe not disappointment, but take the reality like it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="2133">I didn’t have occasion to say my opinion or even something about the Holocaust to Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="2134">If they invited me to the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> when there was Remembrance Day, they were asking me to light a candle. </span><span class="sentence" id="2135">That was all. </span><span class="sentence" id="2136">And they were making some prayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="2137">And the same was here in our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , when they make. </span><span class="sentence" id="2138">And they come such a small number of people that it is really not worth it even to open your mouth to talk to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2139">But I wasn’t asked to talk about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="2140">I wasn’t asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="2141">They talk, they make some prayers and that’s all. </span><span class="sentence" id="2142">And that was very miserable, miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="2143">I was ashamed that I was a part of this Remembrance Day. </span><span class="sentence" id="2144">And that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2145">Jews are not interested in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2146">Maybe they have it enough in books. </span><span class="sentence" id="2147">Maybe they read about it, if that’s possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="2148">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2149">But even when it is written, even when they read about it, I think, in my opinion, they have an opportunity to hear it from the first source. </span><span class="sentence" id="2150">They should ask to hear of it, they should. </span><span class="sentence" id="2151">But I don’t know why they didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="2152">Very ignorant, very ignorant. </span><span class="sentence" id="2153">And then they are not interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="2154">The people, the few people who survive, they are not interested, because they know the same, they have their opinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="2155">And the other people are here, born here or for years are here, they are already, they are already accustomed of the American habits, of the Jewish habits. </span><span class="sentence" id="2156">That’s what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="2157">They are not interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2158">QUESTION:  Do you feel that the people who were born here and who are from here, are less, have been less receptive to you personally than have the newcomers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2159">ANSWER:  Well, I feel it, I feel 1t maybe personally, but I don’t blame them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2160">Maybe they were expecting more involvement from my side in their community life, which I couldn’t do, first of my age, secondly my language is not good enough to expose my... it is maybe improved already, but in the beginning my English was good to read, to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="2161">But to speak with my accent, to talk about my experience and to be active in their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community,</span> it wasn’t easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="2162">It was maybe difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="2163">I even proposed and asked the Rabbi I can help him with the Hebrew lessons in the <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="2164">But he never asked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2165">And nobody did ask me to give a hand to something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2166">Maybe to a money drive, maybe they will ask me to do it, but that’s not my specialty. </span><span class="sentence" id="2167">I will not do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2168">And that’s one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2169">The other thing is, which one influential person told me, that they feel humiliated in my company. </span><span class="sentence" id="2170">That I am too special for them, so therefore they are hesitating approach me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2171">Well, I don’t know what is true, what the reason 1s, but this is the reality what I told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="2172">Iam a stranger for them and I will remain always to them a stranger. </span><span class="sentence" id="2173">However they are friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="2174">If I approach them they answer my questions, but that’s all, that’s all. </span><span class="sentence" id="2175">What can you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="2176">That’s the reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="2177">And you have to live with it and we take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2178">And we learn after so many years of life, you learn to live with the reality, with each <span class="NPIP">reality</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2179">This is the main source of our strength, to take the everyday reality in our life as custom life. </span><span class="sentence" id="2180">And that’s it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2181">QUESTION:  Last time after we finished our interview you mentioned off tape, something about the “business” of the Holocaust or the business that the Holocaust has become and I wonder if you would say something about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2182">Does it bother you or do you feel that the Holocaust has been overly commercialized? </span><span class="sentence" id="2183">47
ANSWER:  Again, I don’t know who will hear this tape, but in the meantime there will be more business in this <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2184">You know, each community tries to make a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> , which in itself is maybe a nice deed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2185">But who will come to this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="2186">I think the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> which is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> is the one which was a necessity, very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="2187">And it fills all the spectrum of Holocaust and of Jewish life, before the war, in the war and after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="2188">Maybe there are some nuances which come out which are not of value. </span><span class="sentence" id="2189">But to make so many, I think people will not be interested to go to the main <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> where they have everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="2190">And this happens because of the way how Jewish society is built in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2191">It has to be a society, it has to be a president, it has to be a vice-president, it has to be a secretary, it has to be members of the board and so forth and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="2192">Maybe in itself it is as a social thing, maybe it is good, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="2193">But I think a majority of the raised funds goes to administrative use, the paperwork and to expenses which are not profit of the social needs of people who really needs the help. </span><span class="sentence" id="2194">That is what I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="2195">And about commercializing the Holocaust, I think when you take thousand books and you put them in a computer and you take the essence, I think from these thousands you will make one book which includes everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="2196">So there is no need, in my opinion, for so many editions, for so many work with it in... I don’t know, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2197">Of course, you can see a lot of people who became very famous because of the Holocaust, very famous. </span><span class="sentence" id="2198">But I don’t want to criticize them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2199">I don’t want to criticize nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="2200">But I think it is a crime if somebody makes it only for the business.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2201">QUESTION:  I’m coming to the end of my questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="2202">Is there something that we haven’t talked about that you'd like to talk about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2203">ANSWER:  Well, I gave, I gave a sketch about my experiences and about how I see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2204">It doesn’t mean that I don’t have, in general, what to say about. </span><span class="sentence" id="2205">And especially to the future generations of Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="2206">Maybe somebody will listen to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2207">Maybe somebody will try to understand my point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="2208">But it is in the moment, I am ninety years old and I passed through all kind of Jewish life with joy and suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="2209">It is like one Jewish sage said: “It is good to be born a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="2210">It’s good to die a Jew, but what do you do in the meantime, this is the problem.” </span><span class="sentence" id="2211">From the beginning until the end, the Jews have a very rich historical experience of life, which many other religion or communities don’t have. </span><span class="sentence" id="2212">Not because they wanted, but the wind of history put the Jews in the center of cultural life. </span><span class="sentence" id="2213">Even in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="2214">Not only in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , not only in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> or in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2215">Everywhere where the Jews were the center of civilized life, of cultural life was concentrated in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish communities</span> or singles. </span><span class="sentence" id="2216">Jewish Nobel Prize winners, there were scientists in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in <span class="REGION">medical field</span> , in general science are not compatible to no one other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="2217">Maybe this is the reason that the jealousy of other people brings them to hatred. </span><span class="sentence" id="2218">I cannot wish that the Jews wouldn’t concentrate of all this progress and culture and civilization. </span><span class="sentence" id="2219">A <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> they have to do everything possible what brings progress to the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="2220">But I am turning to the other point not to cover this with egocentric religious or national use. </span><span class="sentence" id="2221">To take it more in human general perspective and civilized ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="2222">This is my advice and this is my way of thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="2223">And that, and we will remember this, this can maybe, maybe some day bring to make us even with other <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> in civilized world. </span><span class="sentence" id="2224">That we will not be scapegoats in any way, which we were during all our history from the beginning until today. </span><span class="sentence" id="2225">To avoid it, listen what I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="2226">Thank you.</span></p>
