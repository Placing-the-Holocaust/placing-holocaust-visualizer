<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  And you remember <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Battenberg</span> even though you were young, you remember living there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  Iremember very much living there, and I loved the <span class="REGION">area</span> , because it’s in a what’s called Throwtargabeerga in German, and on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Aida</span> , which was the biggest -- had the biggest <span class="DLF">dam</span> , about 10 kilometers away in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">As a matter of fact, it was just finished when Hitler was in power, and he made a lot of propaganda for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">He wanted to imitate the <span class="DLF">Hoover dam</span> at that time.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I have a non-Jewish friend who is writing me regularly, we are in contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">But we only got in contact three years ago when I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Battenberg</span> just to see the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and I didn’t recognize it, 1t had changed so much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  But you also -- you also remember anti-Semitic incidents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  Very -- yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">The one thing we had there, we had a neighbor who was -- his name was George, I don’t remember his last name, he threw stones into our <span class="DLF">windows</span> all the time, and we had constantly to repair <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">They were -- and we children were persecuted. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">We had to walk approximately one and a half miles to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I would say, since we lived on the upper part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and the ch -- the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was in the <span class="REGION">lower part</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So children were already throwing stones at us, and we were ostracized. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">As a matter of fact, at the end they put us 1n the back row in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , next to the Gypsies.</span></p>

ANSWER:  My mother was very observant of the Jewish laws, and she cooked kosher, and ub -- I would not say that it was overly kosher, but my father was very much on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , since he used to go to farmers, and they used to give him pork and sausages when he was an agronomist and worked for the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So he didn’t believe in any of these dietary laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And sometimes he took us children along, and we tasted pork, and he said, “Don’t tell your mom.” </span><span class="sentence" id="92">The first thing when we came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , naturally children say, “Do you know where we went? </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Daddy took us to this and this farmer, and we had a wonderful bratwurst.” </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And my mother almost exploded. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But those were incidents that were still pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And 1 -- when we were then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Friedberg</span> , my father had a lot of friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="97"><span class="BUILDING">School</span> friends, and he was a good athlete. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">He used to play very good football, and he used to belong to a league, and some of the Germans that tried to contact us -- or contact him, did so. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">But it got less and less as time goes on. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And --

<p><span class="sentence" id="216">ANSWER:  We -- we weren’t allowed to listen to any <span class="BUILDING">foreign stations</span> , but this Communist, this -- who was married to a Jewish wife, used to come and tell my father what was said, because he was listening clandestinely, apparently, in -- in a group of people, and used to tell him what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">But at that time the Germans made big progress into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , then into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and by that time a lot of Jews were already deported to the east, and we were lucky to be there yet till ’40 -- lucky? </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I wouldn’t say lucky -- till September ’42, when we were rounded up. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And as I said, our luck was that my father was an officer in the first World War, and he had the Purple Cross, the German ahtler, and whe -- we were privileged to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And needless to say, for my parents it was a very terrible thing, but we children didn’t realize what it meant for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , and we saw a lot of children, and we were able to play, and congregate with them, and that was very important for my psyche, because I was so excommunicated from -- from children in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , let’s say, or separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I don’t find the right word I want to express.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">QUESTION:  So you -- you actually felt initially, when you were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> that things felt a little bit better for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  Mu -- yes, better for me, and at -- the good thing was that my father, since he was also an academic, and he had a background in the Whymara government that he got a job in the Judenrat in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , which was a big privilege. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Also, he was a very minor, minor official. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">My mother used to say he probably has to sweep the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> of the -- of the Judenrat, of the bigshots there. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">That’s about all that -- but that enabled him for us, between my brother and myself, to get us into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kinderheim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">At first we thought we both were going to go to the <span class="BUILDING">kinderheim</span> , but somehow or other there was such an overflow of children they didn’t have enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , so we had to choose between -- my parents had to choose between my brother and myself, and they decided that I should go to the <span class="BUILDING">kinderheim</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  Do you know why they decided that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  I have no idea, my -- I -- I couldn’t get along with my mother so well, like girls do with -- sometimes, with mothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">My father thought that I was the older one, that I should go. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">That was actually for me a wonderful experience, since food was naturally the first thing on our mind, but being with the same group of people, being able to communicate it, to learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Because in the kinderheim, every <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> had a sort of a teacher that had to keep us busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And I remembered we had a girl named Hoyman -- Eta Hoyman, she was very well known in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the Zionist movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And she read books with us, we learned history of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and it was a very good, wonderful experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">However, it didn’t last, like nothing lasts. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Unfortunately, my brother during that time became sick with typhus and was quarantined. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">My mother was terribly upset about it, and I had to try to cheer her up a little bit here and there, and I have made acquaintance with a pianist in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , and she was in the entertainment part, and she got us tickets to various performances. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And my mother liked it very much, and I used to go with her in the afternoons or evenings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  So there were certain cultural activities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">ANSWER:  Yes, only in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">It was the -- as everybody knows, the camp that they -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> that was open to show how well the Jews were treated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">QUESTION:  What are your first recollections of seeing, or meeting Nazis, even before, perhaps, before going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  I -- my mother always said, “As soon as you see these black shirts, or the brown shirts marching down the main <span class="DLF">street</span> ,” in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Battenberg</span> when we were small, because that was a nest of Nazis, “you come straight into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="245">They -- they put a -- a fear into us children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  And did you have any personal interactions you recall?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  Only as I said, when we walked to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the morning, many times children of -- of Nazis were trying to persecute us, and hit us, and -- but somehow or other, I had sort of a lucky star, and I don’t remember the real bad, bad, bad episodes, except that at night we always were afraid to go to sleep, because of the stones that came into the <span class="DLF">window</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  And that was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Battenberg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  That was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Battenberg</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Friedberg</span> that never happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  And also later di -- in your -- in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> you were attending, I read something once that said the Gestapo was already monitoring these <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> you attended. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Did you -- did you see any officials -- Nazi officials around your <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  I don’t remember, I really don’t remember, but it could well be. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I have a book here from the phila -- about the philanthropine, and maybe we can look it up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  I was just curious if any of that -- you know, if you remembered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">ANSWER:  No, I don’t remember that, I only remember that in the last few months I did not go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> any more, I stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with my parents, and I helped out in a <span class="BUILDING">old age home</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">washing floors</span> , I was 14, and they made me scrub the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Had to kneel down -- was backbreaking work for a 14 year old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">QUESTION:  And that was after you were no longer allowed to go?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  The de -- de -- deportation was a horrible experience because we were all taken to a point in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Darmstardt</span> , which is south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , a major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and apparently they had <span class="BUILDING">Quonset huts</span> there, and they rounded up all the Jews from the arou -- surrounding areas, all the people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hesse</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , and the bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And we were sort of divided in groups, and it depended on your status in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and as I said, my father had that luck, that we -- wasn’t the luck for him, unfortunately, he lost his life, but that we were on the -- so that we are put on the side to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">His brother -- and we were very close to them, this -- this 1s not the same brother as the one that was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> -- well, that was really later -- a younger brother, who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Nauheim</span> with his family, they had two boys, and they were put on the side to go to the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And my father tried everything to -- for them to be with us, but it didn’t -- he couldn’t do anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So then the actual, when we find -- I don’t know what we ate there, I’ve no idea what -- what the rations were. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">The rations in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> already were very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">For us poorer than for the general public, but we -- we depended on potatoes, cabbage, and what do you call these? </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Halloween --

<p><span class="sentence" id="694">ANSWER:  I think they have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I’m sure -- my husband did all of this, I am not aware of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">QUESTION:  Okay, so -- so now tell me about -- tell me about the day that you were sent out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and -- and the circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">What -- what exactly happened that day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">ANSWER:  We were up -- we were rounded up, about 800 - 900 young girls, Hungarians, German Jews, Polish Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">The German Jews were a minority -- I was among those, and Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Our Czech brothers and si -- our Czech sisters that were -- came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> with us, we assembled on the <span class="DLF">plaza</span> , and then gi -- Mengele came and selected about four to 500 women. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Among them was me. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">I had held the hand of my friend Ruth Wertheim, who probably pulled me over, because I was so small, and sickly already. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And he might not have seen it, 1t was dusk, and gray and evening, and we were put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , on the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> again, a closed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mattsdorf</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reasonkeperga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="704">We arrived there the next day, and were unloaded, and the thing was they didn’t have enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for us, so they quickly built <span class="BUILDING">Quonset huts</span> on top of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and that’s where we were located. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">That was a -- an plus for us, because the heat rises up from the machinery that went on 24 hours a day in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and we felt the first time a little warmth. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And also, the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> had to get rid of dirty water that -- hot water that came out of the machinery, since they were cooled by water, and we washed ourselves, and we kept ourselves pretty clean during that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">But that was a time I got sick very fast, and a doctor came and put me in the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I was coughing, I had a mastitis which was draining. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">My I-le -- ma -- in ma - on my ri-right breast for eight months, even after we were liberated yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">It gave me terrible pain, and I had absolutely no incentive or will to live at that time any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">But my friend Ruth Wertheim, and Hannah Laura Breaker, both kept me going. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">One day as we were standing there and talking in appelle, somehow or other, the foreman of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> came by, and he said, “How come you girls speak so well German?” </span><span class="sentence" id="713">So we said, “We -- we are Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">We went to <span class="BUILDING">German schools</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="715">He couldn’t understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">So next day he brought us an apple, and we divided the apple in three. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And that was the first time that a German showed some kind of compassion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">QUESTION:  Was he an SS?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">ANSWER:  No, he was a worker, a -- a -- the foreman. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Not -- not an SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">If the f -- SS would have known, probably he would have been fired, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">But at that time, it was towards the end of the war, and they were very much wrapped up with the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> that was very close to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">We heard the shooting all night long.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">QUESTION:  Can you describe, approximately where -- where this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> was? </span><span class="sentence" id="725">You -- you were saying --
ANSWER:  It was very near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gross-Rosen</span> , and right across from us was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> of French prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">They actually wor-worked in our <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , too -- do -- to -- did some heavy man’s labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">And some girls even sort of befriended them, or made some kind of contact with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">QUESTION:  So in your <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> it was only for women, is that right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">ANSWER:  That, yes, that part was only for women, where -- where the flax was made into -- mixed with a certain synthetic material for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">parachutes</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">QUESTION:  And you were telling me before, when the tape ran out, the exact job that you were doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="731">ANSWER:  Yes, I was -- as the raw flax, which -- which made sores on my hand because they are stalks, and you had to be fast putting it into the machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">My hands were always bloody, and injured from this job. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And the seeds went into a bucket used for something else, and the stalks w-were put through other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span> , and refined towards cha -- changing it into a material.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">QUESTION:  And this was pretty hard -- you know, difficult labor, would you say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">ANSWER:  It was very difficult labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">I was on one of the worst <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">My friend Ruth Wertheim was lucky, she was actually in a part of the sewing part, where they already mixed the nylon, or whatever they had, some synthetic type of process, with the flax material. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And it was easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">So, actually, I was on the worst end of the labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">That’s why I got sick very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">The -- the <span class="DLF">door</span> was always open for the flax to be thrown in, which was also done by girls, and some French prisoners brought the heavy bundles. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And this went for eight -- almost eight months, from October to May, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">We almost worked towards the very, very end of April in -- fully on these machines.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="744">QUESTION:  Were you hearing any news about the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">ANSWER:  Yes, we heard that they were coming nearer, nearer. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">The French soldiers warned us that they might blow us up, so one morning all of a sudden, all the Germans were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">They were -- the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was locked up, all <span class="BUILDING">Quonset huts</span> were locked up, and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">We thought they are going to blow us up, but nothing happened, nobody was around, nuth -- nobody came. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">That went on for 24 hours, and we searched for food, and there was really nothing left. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And then finally we saw a Russian soldier come on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , and s-somebody yelled out of a <span class="DLF">window</span> , or whatever, and he came and alerted the Russian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And the first thing the girls did -- I was too sick, slaughter a cow, or Sa -- or a -- or something, or [indecipherable] just to get some f -- real good food into us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">QUESTION:  There was a cow nearby, you mean, or --
ANSWER:  Oh, there were <span class="DLF">farms</span> nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">It was a very beautiful <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Oh, besides our regular job, many times in middle of the night, some of us were taken, every time a different c-cloud to shovel coal, to di -- ti -- when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coal wagons</span> were brought in, we had to empty them so they could be used right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And I remember one night was terribly cold, snow on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , and we found something that looked so red, we took it, and was a liver from some kind of an animal, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And we took it into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and my friend Ruth put it on some kind of a heating mechanism, maybe a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radiator</span> , or a machine that had heat, and sort of fried it a little, and the three of us divided it and ate it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">QUESTION:  You were with a third friend as well there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">ANSWER:  That Hannah Laura Breaker, three of us.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="760">ANSWER:  Yes, that -- that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="761">There too, there wa -- there were two Polish girls, and they claimed that they were lesbians. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Polish Jewish girls that this German woman used them for sexual whatever, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And they were put in charge of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And afterwards we really got after the two.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">QUESTION:  The two in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">ANSWER:  In -- in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="767">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I don’t see -- I have seen a non -- none except SS.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="777">QUESTION:  So when -- when you were not feeling well, you were also given some medical attention while you were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">ANSWER:  Yes, that was after awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">A man came, a Dr. Hoffman, and apparently he was only a medic, he was not a doctor, we found out after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">We searched him. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">He actually helped a lot of the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Few girls that -- that came with us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> were pregnant, and had babies there, and miscarriages. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Maybe three or four, but I think two survived and took their babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And --
