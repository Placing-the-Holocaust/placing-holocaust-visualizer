ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  All right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  All right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Okay, the first -- the first thing that -- that I’m going to do is, they asked me to fill in a couple of gaps in the interview that you did with them on the video. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">There were a couple of things, n-not so much during the war, but before and immediately after that they wanted me to ask about, to just fill in the <span class="DLF">gaps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And then we’ll focus on from after the war to the present. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And if at any point you want to stop and take a break, or you need, for whatever reason, to stop, or if there’s a question I ask that you’d rather not talk about, just say so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Like to start by asking you about your family, about -- let’s start with your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Who were they, what were they like as people, as parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  They were very nice people, they were very good parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My father’s name was Dezso Wielisz.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  How do you spell that, his first name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  D-e-z-s-o, with two dots on the O. That’s a real Hungarian spelling, it’s a real Hungarian name. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">The family name was Wieisz and after the war, in 1948, they changed the family name to Varga, because of the situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  And how can you s -- how do you spell that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Varga? </span><span class="sentence" id="16">V-a-r-g-a.
QUESTION:  And so at what time would that name change have happened, roughly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  I believe it happened after I left from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I left the end of ’46, so the year it happened, probably the beginning of 48.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  And so you say they changed it because of the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Do you mean -- how do you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Well, Pll go -- let me go back, let me tell you something about my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">My mother’s maiden name was Julia Schwartz. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And my mother -- actually both of my parents were born the northwest -- northeast part of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And my mother was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ungvar</span> , and my father was born in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boattfaller</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">They were -- well, what’s the word I want to use? </span><span class="sentence" id="25">My father was quite a few years older than my mother and he waited until she grew up for them to get married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  How much age difference?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  About eight years, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And -- and by that time my father lived in a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in -- more in the middle of the hung -- eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , that’s where I was born, called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debrecen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And he was a well established businessman at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And my mother was a very beautiful woman and they were a very handsome couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I had three sisters; there was four children in the family, all girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And I lived a nice life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  Tell me about your sisters, their names.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  My sisters, oh yeah, I’m the oldest, I’m child number one. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I have a sister who is almost five years younger and another one who was born three years after her and one three years after.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  And their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Martha, Mariann -- actually Marianna and Gabriela is the youngest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  Just going to move the microphone a little closer so we can pick you up better. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Not a whole lot, but just a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And they all made it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  We all survived, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Well, our situation was a little bit different than my husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  I understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  So we all survived together, we were all together all through that year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  And what has happened to your sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  They are fine, we all survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">One sister lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">One lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> and the youngest one stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to take care of our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">See, the other two sisters, the two middle girls left <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in 1956, after - during and after the revolution that they had in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> then. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And one ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and the other one made it to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  So you’re the only one that left right away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  I left right away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Well, we’ll get to that, cause that’s much of what we want to talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Were you poor, middle class, well-to-do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Well, it went from good to bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">When I was born my father was -- we weren’t rich, but well-to-do. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And what I remember as a child growing up is hearing about things. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">When the crash of the <span class="BUILDING">stock market</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and the [indecipherable] got over to Europe by the mid 30’s, it had an effect on my father’s business. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And then eventually, in 1938, Hitler was in power and that was getting downhill. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And by 1942 my father was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Your -- your parent’s parents, your grandparents, how would you describe th- them in terms of their -- or theirs s-status financially, socially?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  I don’t even know, I remember my grandparents as old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Somehow they were always old. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">My pare -- my mother’s parents and my grandfather had a business, he was a well-to-do man. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">They lived in a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  He was a what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  A well-to-do man. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">He -- they lived in a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I can still remember [indecipherable] built into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And they had the business on the bottom of the -- you know, the <span class="INT_SPACE">street floor</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was up on top, and it was a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with beautiful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">We used to go there to visit and spent -- I spent a lot of vacation time over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">My grandmother was a beautiful woman, a very stately lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And my grandfather was a sweet old man.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  And on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  On the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> they were -- well, it’s a strange stories because my two grandparents -- my two grandmothers were sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">My parents were first cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">My father’s father, he was a different kind of a man, he was -- I don’t know how to describe him. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I just remember him during the hun -- you know, Jewish holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">He was a religious man, not overly, but he was you know, the both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> were very observant Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I remember my father’s father during the -- the Succoth holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And they always had a sukkah built in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , and he would sit there and take all his meals there and have his prayer book there. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Yet, when he got angry, he could yell like -- and scream like a real Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">He had a good temper.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  And you had said in the interview that I saw that your -- your father was able to trace your ancestors in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> back to the early --
ANSWER:  Well, when the troubles -- the -- yes --
QUESTION:  -- 1700’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  -- when the troubles started in the 30’s, you had to trace your ancestry back as far as you could go, because by 1938 - ’39, they were picking up people who were not so-called Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">See, by that time we had a lot of people coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and they were mostly, I suppose at that time looking for those people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  Little did we know that nothing 1s going to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And yes, my father did trace our ancestry back into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to the 1700’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">On paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  I want to jump around a little bit, cause again we’re filling in little gaps in the previous interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">You went to a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> when it’s --
ANSWER: <span class="BUILDING"> High school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION: <span class="BUILDING"> High school</span> , 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I’m curious, you had gone to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> prior to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  Why not a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="96">How did you end up there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  There was no <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> for girls, that’s why.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  So it was --
ANSWER:  And this was a specialized school, and unfortunately only the Catholic school system had it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  Specialized in what way”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  It’s more of an art oriented high school.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  And you were gifted in art?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  Sort of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  I understand you still --
ANSWER:  That was where we learned dress designing, tailoring, sewing, drawing, and all associated with the arts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  Te-Tell me about friendships that you had in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , both with Jewish girls and non-Jewish girls, if in fact you did have friendships with non-Jewish girls.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Actually, well we had quite a few Jewish girls going to that same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I don’t mean too many, but you know, those were very small classes actually, so they had maybe I don’t know whether -- the first year I think maybe we had about 10 Jewish girls, and after that they sort of left. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">They’re maybe were two or three of them left altogether in the class, and -- but as far as non-Jewish girls, other than being in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with them no, I don’t think I was really friendly with any of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">That were strange over there, see, because we grew up separated, you know, from early childhood, and we never mixed with non-Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">We only wil -- saw Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So by the time you were a teenager in your late teens in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> it’s -- we were friendly but we were never really so-called friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  Was that by choice or by official design that you’d -- you stayed amongst yourselves?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  I don’t think it was a [indecipherable] really, it just the way it worked out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Would you -- how would you -- I’m thinking in terms of many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">American cities</span> where blacks live on one side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and whites live on another side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , where -- whereas there might not at this time be a legal reason why they can’t live together, they often don’t, and I’m wondering was it a similar situation or was it --
ANSWER:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">There was one <span class="REGION">area</span> where most -- were more dominated by Jewish people, mostly by the real Orthodox and the Hassidic type of Jews, but other than that, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">There was no <span class="REGION">area</span> where you had to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  That was my question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  No, no, no, no, no, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Cause I know in some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in Europe there had been the remnants of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettoes</span> from previous eras.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shtetl</span> , yes --
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  -- I know, and I’ve been arguing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I never lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetl</span> , no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  That’s what I was trying to establish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  At least not in my time in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So you did not have friends with non-Jewish kids that you were clo --
ANSWER:  Not close friends, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But by the time I got to that <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , it was already troubled times. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Hitler was already on the horizons and as sweet as the nuns were -- there were a couple of them who were wonderful, and I really think of them highly forever, because they were nice human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But then there were others who just as soon would have hand me over to the first Nazi who came about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  Tell me about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">What -- what memories do you have of these nuns that you got that feeling about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Well, I remember especially the one nun -- you know, it -- I mean, you go to a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> and there’s -- during the time you go and you have to say some kind of a prayer, at least in those days they did, and I remember at one time this particular nun came up to me and said, you better go down on your knee and pray because what’s happening out in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And in those days a lot of Jewish people did convert to Catholicism and -- hoping it will save them, but nothing did. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Nothing did because you not only had to prove that you lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> centuries back -- you also had to prove that you were not Jewish centuries back, so it didn’t help. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I remember when we were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> already, there was a young woman doctor with us, she never knew she was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Her parents converted during the first World War or right after, so she was born, you know, as Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And yet she was considered a Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  This -- so this nun that told you you better get on your knees, wa -- I’m unclear, was she saying that with malice or with concern?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  No, I think it was malice and no concern, because if it would have been concern, I probably wouldn’t remember it the way I do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  What about the other kids? </span><span class="sentence" id="141">You intimated in your previous interview that you had experienced some -- some anti-Semitic --
ANSWER:  Well, while we were in the class it was fine, there was no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Well, the thing I mentioned then, I believe it was that when we were being marched from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> , there was one of the girls that I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with and I used to walk with her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and she thought of nothing picking up a stone and throw it at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">See, people -- we were walking in the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and the people were standing on both sides on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> and watching us leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  But back when you were going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , what did you experience in terms of any -- or did you -- any problems with any of the other Gentile girls?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  I don’t remember any, really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Let’s talk about the conditions of your deportation from your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">W -- How did that come about? </span><span class="sentence" id="149">You -- you rushed through it a little bit in your previous interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I mean, how did you find out that it was going to happen and what -- could you tell us, sort of take us through from when you found out that it was going to happen til when you were actually --
ANSWER:  [indecipherable] okay, let me go back to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , 1938, when our principal came into the class -- well, I guess he went to every <span class="BUILDING">class</span> , to tell us what’s happening in the world and what we may accep -- expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And he had -- a big guy, and he had tears in his eye -- his eyes as he was talking to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">That was 1938, and I think s -- well, at first -- after that 1t was getting harder to hold a job if you were a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I remember in 1939 it was when my father lost his job, he was a -- a district manager for a -- a farm machinery company, and he lost his job because he was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And then 1942 -- well, in 1939, when Hitler gave back the northern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> that belonged to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and that time to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And my father was in a uniform, the Hungarian army’s uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">He fought in the first World War, so he was called up again to pay the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> back. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And by 1941 he was called into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , ’41 - ’42 then they let him out for awhile and then they- took him back again. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">In 1944, March 19", it was on a Sunday afternoon when the Germans -- German army flew over <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I can still see it, it was a dreary, nasty day. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">No sunshine at all, and I guess it was foreboding of what was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And we saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> fly over our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and after that it went one, two, three. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">They came in on the 19". </span><span class="sentence" id="163">By April fifth we had to put on the Jewish star. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">May sixth we were put into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I was watching them building the six foot high <span class="DLF">wall</span> all around the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">In my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debrecen</span> , they had to make two different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> because there was a main <span class="DLF">road</span> going to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> which they couldn’t cut off. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So there was a smaller <span class="NPIP">side</span> where we lived and there was a larger side on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">So our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> happened to be in the smaller <span class="REGION">area</span> , so that’s where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And to the day the <span class="DLF">wall</span> was finished we did not believe it, that it will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">It was impossible, we lived there forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I was born there, I grew up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">People were hoping that the mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , little did they know that he had no say so, won’t let it happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">But at any rate, May 6, 1944, we were locked into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And in June --
QUESTION:  I hate -- I hate to say it, we are going to need to do something about the phone.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="728">QUESTION:  When you say not easy, in what way not easy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">ANSWER:  Well, because of his, I guess because of his personality and because -- oops -- what all those years, you know, did to him and the way he [indecipherable] may have changed his personality and what he could have been like.</span></p>
