<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  Oh dear, what a tragedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  And that was very unfortunate, because she was really a very wonderful person. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">But of course, I was only nine when this started, so I never really knew what a wonderful November 21, 2011 person she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I knew it mainly through other people, who told me about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">She was, you know, she had — of course had not gone to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , but she was pretty smart, and she had a lot of common sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And she was very — she had a lot of empathy. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And I’ tell you a little story, during the depression, you know, in — starting in 1930, I guess, when there was so much poverty in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , she started a <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  Wow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  And it’s one of my most vivid memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We — the <span class="DLF">kitchen door</span> was on the side, and the <span class="DLF">kitchen door</span> had — had sort of a <span class="DLF">window</span> you could raise up to the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And we would have, every day, about 20 people who came. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">After a while, we started giving out little slips to people, to say which day they could come, and — with their name. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And I know I used to write those slips, which is why I remember it so well. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And then they would come starting at noon, and our cook would have a big soup, you know, something substantial, and bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And if it was raining, we put them in the — one of the <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And then the people would eat their lun-lunch, or main meal, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">In fact, we had one couple that found each other and got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And then on Christmas, she always had everybody come, and she — they got — the men got shaving cream and stuff like that, and the women got some other stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">He — they — they all got the little bag with goodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So she really, I mean, and that was entirely my mother’s make — doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  That’s a very kind thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">November 21, 2011
ANSWER:  And she really, I mean, that’s the kind of person she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">But, of course, the addiction was dreadful, because you know, a-an addiction to morphine is the same as — as a heroin addiction, or any other. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">It’s unpredictable. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">The mood can be — one day you think, oh, she’s wonderful, and then you talk a lot, and then the next day she’s gone again, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And — and she did go into <span class="BUILDING">rehab</span> twice in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and then it was better for a while, but it never lasted. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And then when she came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> — you know, I don’t know where she got her morphine. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">That’s sometimes the curse of having money. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And — but a — it was the same in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tucson</span> , where she lived, I mean, she — and in the end, it wa — was just awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">But you know, tha-that is — that was very sad, really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And hard for children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  But, you know, it — the one thing I — I— I have told this to my kids from the day they were born, in order to make sure that they stayed away from all drugs, because I told them how horrible this is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  Well, the price that people pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">The price that the family pays, the price that the person pays.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  It —1t’s —1t’s —1t’s really very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">But, you know — and — and I know — I mean, we all know it was — it was her surgeon who got her addicted, and he was addicted him — a lot of doctors are addicted, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">November 21, 2011
QUESTION:  Well, before that happened, you would have been nine years or less, but you mention that your parents would go out in the evenings. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Did they — did they enjoy each other’s company?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  Yes, they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And — and, as I think I want to — I mean, they got divorced in ’38. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I think it had na — it had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that my mother was Jewish, and my father wasn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">My sister and I saw that divorce coming for years. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Which doesn’t mean they weren’t friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">They were very friendly, they always talked to each other and — and — but, you know, I — it’s very hard to look at your parents and think about sex.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  That’s true.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  But I think it was very — they were incompatible. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">That’s what I think, you know, and I think that my father wasn’t that interested in it, and my mother was more interested 1n it, and do I think that was the basis for the divorce. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Because she got married again, but — to the guy that she’d been going with for years, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  Did you all know about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Kids always know everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Kids know everything.</span></p>
