<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Good morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Nice to see you here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Tell me when you were born, and what your name was at birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Well, I was -- I was born on the fifth of November, 1930, and certainly I had the same name as I have, Hans Mommsen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Same name. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Tell me something about your -- your family, your mother and your father, and your -- you have a twin brother, I gather.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  S -- I had the twin brother, and my father was historian at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marburg</span> , and -- because many people ask that, Theodor Mommsen is the great-grandfather.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And he won a -- a Nobel Prize, didn’t he --
ANSWER:  Yes, he did, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  -- in 1903. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">So, at what age did you start being very conscious of this very prominent background in your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Quite late, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">There was no -- there was no -- no tendency to miternigize Theodor Mommsen at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  You know, that was not necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  We rather were timid to -- to talk about Theodor, and especially not to use that relation, if one had contact to the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  And was your mother a professional as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  No, my mother is a -- just a housewife, she is from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prame</span> and -- and she comes from a bank-banking fam-family, and they broke down in the hyper-inflation in 1923, and thus in a way, had a negative impact on the relation between my parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  In what way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Well, it -- there was no money left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  And my mother, you know, she was used to have s -- plenty of money all the time, and now -- and suddenly there was none, because the salary of a German [indecipherable] professor was not too high, if he now had four kids, and that was our case. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And certainly he | -- lost many of his income after the Nazis took over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  So that meant that your par -- th -- your relationship between your parents was not --
ANSWER:  Right, 1t could have been a bit better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  -- was not so easy -- better. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Did that affect you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I think so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  Mm. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">You said four kids?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  So, twin brother, older brother, and?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Had two older brothers, we were four brothers, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And what’s the difference in age between --
ANSWER:  Well, the oldest one is born in 1923, next in ’27, and we are 1930.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So --
ANSWER:  And the oldest are [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">They had a lot of war experience in the second World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  When do you first become conscious of the -- the Nazis, what -- I mean, what kind of a dec -- do you remember as a kid seeing things 1n the <span class="DLF">streets</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Hearing things on the radio?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  Well, it -- Well, it’s difficult to say, you know, because to recognize the Nazis as something which 1s really distinct from the general conditions, you wouldn’t, I think, be aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Before the war -- although, you know, my first interesting, and -- experience in the contemporary history, was arige Crystal Night. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And it was a quite strange story, because my father wanted to see what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">The <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> which was burning, was directly besides of the <span class="BUILDING">lecture building</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , and my father was teaching at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , and by that he had a pretext to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Because it was not accessible for the public, it was only SA men who were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">In order to get into that, and oh -- he took the twins, and by that, it looked that way, he [indecipherable] but we all the time, asked him, “Father, why doesn’t the firefighters come?” </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And he said, “Psst, psst, psst.” </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And I remember the scenery, and certainly the thing which is interesting then, for the historian, 1s that there was no public people, there was only the SA. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">It was certainly not as Goebbels had tried to let it appear, as a riot of the German people, it was just only the -- the Nazi activists, and the others didn’t have any access to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  And how did you -- And how did -- Do you ha-have any idea how your dad got access, or were you far away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  No, we go -- we went to the -- the adjacent <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , we knew that way well, you know --
QUESTION:  Were you frightened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  Because he got exception. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">No, that was nearby, nearb --
QUESTION:  Were you scared by this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Not -- Not random, oh, I don’t know, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">You know, but I remember it only -- recollect it only because of the fact that the father has such strange answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  That was it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  When you went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I mean when he -- when you asked him there, you know, why isn’t there a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fire truck</span> stopping this, and he tells you to be quiet, was there any talk when you went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="61">None?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  No, wouldn’t talk about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  No, huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  Yep. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">We got the feeling that he didn’t want to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">He wouldn’t talk about any politics at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Certainly he had some contact to some representatives to the resistance movement, with one of the advisors of William Loishner, the [indecipherable] board visit him regularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And we got aware only of the fact that he left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , he didn’t receive th -- him in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and -- and everything was very secret, and -- and by that th-the kids got afraid there was something happening, and in [indecipherable] that was his conduct. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And once, you know, I just picked up a sentence that was quite symptomatic, in German, that ronteheron in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> with an auchnie pas etou and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">That means the people in the ministry down there wouldn’t do either, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And certainly that reflected the situation as the German resistance, that they couldn’t, in a way, use the governmental institutions to raise a resistance, because everything was Nazified, or -- or the administration was without any influence because the Nazi party had a -- a -- a bypass, or surpass them. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">That was the situation, but this is also a later [indecipherable] and a potential.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  And the other thing I remember were the -- two things I remember o-of the Nazi period. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">One is that it has a vidi -- visit of the famous historian, Freidich Meineker, who was known for his distance precision versus the Nazi regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">But he visited us in the summer of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Then the German troops had conquered the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Aprole</span> , that was highest <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Carpathors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And after Meineker had left, Sunday the father said, “Ee, Meineker’s proud of that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We couldn’t get to that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">But cernly all the money was owned in some respects, nationalist that -- although he criticized the regime, on the other hand, he was proud of the merit of the German troops, while my father, as an also World War One officer, all the time was deeply skeptical of what was going on in the Soviet Union, because he could not believe that this would end other than in a defeat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Your dad was not a member of the party?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  He was a member of the party, he was --
QUESTION:  He was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  -- in 1940, he got a -- the -- the pressure of the district leader Karvitski that he should end the party, and then he was taken into the party, but pre-dated to 1937, but he, in a way, he came very late to the party. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">But you know, the party membership, as such, hasn’t much meaning about what the people really thought of. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And we have a lot of nominal members in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">He had some problem, because he was a liberal historian, in the one paid he was a democrat, and in the -- 1943, he suddenly got some pressure that he would have to leave that <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and -- and it was very difficult round then, there were somehow people in the education ministry in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , who helped him, by that he could preserve his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">But he lost the periodical he was editing and he -- his -- it was a ri -- way politically minored, and he would have liktus every day of that, everything was gone, and by that, he was in a bit di-difficult position, but he tried to adapt himself to a certain extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Certainly that is what raise him to manifold that group who was not really conservative. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And er -- which on the other hand, you know, lost the confidence in the restoration, or the continuation of the parliamentary democ -- democratic system. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">There was some disorientation. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Certainly, he was strongly directed against the prevailing tendency of the so called Reich mythology, and he still was very strong in pressing for the importance of the Bismark 1n tradition, so that that was a little bit directed against the great German tendencies. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And so far he had a peculiar position, but he was -- he was not really a member of the opposition. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">He was in the midst between the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And in a way he also had to fear that he got political pressure again, as it happened then, in 1944, I’ll never forget then the famous Gunter Franzel was the historian for the peasants who were in the Third Reich, came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strassburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strassburg</span> had been lost, and now we were sitting at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So they had, years ago, a while been SS, and now my father’s and -- said that he was just as helm, and I -- I never forget that the father was way, way for -- fearful that they wanted to get his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">It looked like they had, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And then I met the same Franzel five months later, after the break down of the regime, you know, in another uniform, and a -- the way, free, different type, you know there you see the change. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I never forgot that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And so far, I think the position of my father’s was a bit precarious, but he was now a hero.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  And your -- your two older brothers, were they brought into the army in ’39, or later?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  Well, my o-oldest brother, certainly he was brought into the army with 18, and then he served all the time, first in -- in the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> , and then in <span class="REGION">Africa</span> , but he -- fortunately he didn’t get to <span class="REGION">northern Africa</span> because there end of the main -- because then -- there was everything finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And then he went back to the Soviet Union, and he survived in a way because he -- in April 1947, fled, and swam through the er -- <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Oude river</span> in order to get into the hands of the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">That was that story. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So the -- he had the pressure o -- you know, of being all the time a soldier at the front, and he was also ma -- sa -- two times wounded, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">That way, typical war -- war age cahount.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  And the younger one, he went in -- first was what you call in German fleckhaffer, that means he had to -- to serve as a suen in the entire air company, and then later on, he also got soldier, and -- but he was younger, and in a way -- he didn’t get to the Soviet Union, but to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And you know, that’s a really strange story, because when he went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlevig Kolchda</span> , that’s in the north of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , that was a <span class="REGION">region</span> where still the great Admiral Doernitz had his _ . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And there they dwell for two or three weeks, they preserved as independent military units, and what is fairly not known, that they had that, what one calls in German, Ate tu exetsianser. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Exercise the great thing, Heil Doenitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">You know that Doenitz wanted to continue, instead of having the Heil Hitler, they now should use a Heil Doenitz, and that was -- is almost unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And then he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with everything one wanted to have, because I know there was a lot of foot stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And [indecipherable] over there at that time, while the other came in American -- ga -- custody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Tell me about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> during this period, when you started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I know you have no comparison, because you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and it’s in -- within the context of the National Socialism, but what was it like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  But it’s strange, you know, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was called <span class="BUILDING">Adolf Hitler school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  Got the name after 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">About the time I take -- round that <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> we'd say <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , that was the second day of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">It was one of the -- not of the old k -- <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , which have Latin and Greek in the center of the lessons, but they had modern languages, that was something, and mod -- more modern type of the <span class="BUILDING">German secondary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And the -- the man who was running that, the director, he was definitely non -- a non-Nazi, that’s quite clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And he tried to avoid too much in indoctrination in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And I have the personal experience, I always warn people to overestimate the decree of ideological indoctrination a -- during the Nazi period. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">You know, that was very strong in the years after 1935, but later on, it was really German, Nationalists certainly, 1t was -- it was not liberal, it was not democratic. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But I can’t remember that there was any talk about -- about race, and racial ideology or so -- th-that would play a big role, and I remember it in the later war years, we had then a specific Nazi teacher, who came with a brown uniform, and so we had a [indecipherable] start, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">It was not a -- the experience which then occurred after, in 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">It’s because they had the same men, and also after [indecipherable] and they had a way bad life, you can -- and that was, you know, not a serious type, he was way d -- he was, I think, really different from the other professors, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And it -- so far, I can’t remember that there was a specific Nazi indoctrination in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Certainly some, you know, and well, you would have the -- the typical <span class="BUILDING">school</span> pil -- festivals or something, but I can’t remember that we were sitting together to listen to the Hitler speech or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Maybe that happened, but it was not very significant, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And as a historian, I add on the commentary, that after 1935, Goebbels in the way, certainly the propaganda on the one hand was very rapidly and tr -- especially in the Jewish case, but there was also some deportization of the whole system be -- if the citizens remained loyal, everything was not- and -- and so far, I think the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was not too much Nazified. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And there was not too much change after -- in the teacher staff, after 1945, and certainly in 1944, we got a little bit more aware of the politic conditions and so on, but there was not much talk, and every f -- thing -- you had to be very busy all the time, and certainly we are -- spent every Sunday to have collecting this or that in the service, or the Deutsch yungfolk, the youth organization of the hi -- of the Hitler youth, or later on even in the Hitler youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I th -- I think, well usually when people think the whole time is a time of interconnection, it’s not so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">At least I didn’t understand anything about the Jewish question before the war was over, then I learned a little bit about it before the -- I was very naive in that way, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So they -- we -- the difference was that the father wouldn’t talk about politics at all, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  And that’s what I have to say to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  You know, in the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> we have, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> , this thing about the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and we show something about “The Poisonous Mushroom.” </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Do you ever remember reading that book, or books like it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So this was not so typical.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  Se-Serious school teachers wouldn’t use that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  But that’s a problem you know where 1-it’s a -- now, and there’s a lot of tendency in the research to start it at -- but when should we weigh causes, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">These things were very tedious. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I can only tell my experience with it --
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  -- with the Deutsch yungfolk, you know, so the --
QUESTION:  Yes, please do.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  Well, you know, besides all -- as you know, far more important than any Nazi indoctrination was the terrible loss of -- of moral radius, something like a -- a -- people got accustomed to moral indifference. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And all these radius were gone undone, there were no longer norms, and by that, you have then this certain de-decay of a civilization. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Certainly if you look at the Jewish question, you have that very clear, you know, it’s the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And there is also, I think the [indecipherable] not only anti-Semitic indoctrination, but it’s, you know, a mentality where people just do what is in their -- their primary interest, and where we have something like an amoral vitality. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And I always grow the -- the famous atrons of -- of Hannibal James Homerker, the leader of the German resistance group, the so-called crisis [indecipherable] who said the foremost talk of the resistance is to restore to picture of man in the hearts of our fellow citizens, in order just to -- to come back to something like a civilized society, so the -- the extreme decay of all radius, of all habits, and so on, and -- we-well we had something like more anarchy. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">This is very important.</span></p>

ANSWER:  -- problems because -- well, that is a very difficult story. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">First of all, he had -- he had some problem because he had American students, and one of them was a man who was in the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of Eisenhower, and he got the unfortunate -- unfortunate idea to ask him whether he should take the position of Minister of cultures in -- in the -- the land of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hessia</span> , because it was a reformer of the university system in the 20’s and the [indecipherable], all the colleagues did everything to get him out of that, but that also put so much [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Then there was an American CID officer, he is still existing, he is politic -- political scientist in <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">He ist -- came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and you won’t believe it, he wanted to press my father to support ESED. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">He was a leftist. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And after my father declined, then he wrote a terrible expertise on him, and that dis-destroyed his career. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">He was losing his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , he had problems with the de-Nazification o -- although at the end he -- he was acquitted, but it took him like a couple of years, and so that -- that affected the kids, because all of the years he didn’t have any income. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So now you take a family from a upper, bourgeois class, with that background, and suddenly there is no money at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">It was very difficult for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">It was difficult for us, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Later on, it -- that wasn’t so -- so important. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">But if that -- if Major Dorn wouldn’t have that wonderful idea, you know, it would have been better for the family.</span></p>

ANSWER:  No, we didn’t lose our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but well, it was -- it was very, very difficult, and certainly we -- we Sold everything what we could, and so on, and Fritz, that was the older brother, he was able to -- to use a <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , and so on, and somehow that worked, but only somehow, it was very hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And I think it wasn’t just -- it was really bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And now with that becomes a little bit known, because people are doing some research on the <span class="BUILDING">Marburg University</span> , it’s very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Well, it’s interesting sa -- that case, you know, because most all these people, all these professors, [indecipherable] officers, only very, very few were thrown out, but in this case, it was very bitter. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">But that was -- well, for me it was very interesting then, and Major Dorn came and then what’s her name, other man who runs for many years, he asked me [indecipherable] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Had a moment, forget a name, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">You know, I never forget a -- suddenly there comes in an American officer, first ttme I see an American officer in uniform in so on, 1t was very impressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I was 14, and then they -- when came, you know, before the war ended, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">ANSWER:  Because the war ended in [indecipherable] with big slayeron you know, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">It’s a very interesting experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And they had started with my father, you know.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="341">ANSWER:  It was -- so Mr. Sweezy [indecipherable] who then was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prame</span> , and wa -- was the only one who accepted the antifar committees, and so on, which existed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Oh --
QUESTION:  How long was it before you were able to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">ANSWER:  Well, I think we could continue in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">That was interrupted anyhow, half a year, because the Americans got that crazy idea, just to have a collective taking into custody of all people who had a title rat. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">The German word 1s rat, and means counselor, th -- you know, that’s in the German civil service, and there was a position, but then suddenly all the teachers sat in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camps</span> , and the [indecipherable] was -- was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Whether we were Nazis or not, you know, that was a really crazy idea, and it took time, then to -- to put the school system into function again, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">By that, I lost a year in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">ANSWER:  But then the -- we stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and later on there was some improvement. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I don’t know why that was done.</span></p>

QUESTION:  And that was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">ANSWER:  Yes, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">But he was giving lectures all the time as emeritus.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION:  Uh, huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And does that mean he was also getting a salary as an emeritus?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  Yes, he got some pensions, you know --
QUESTION:  Some pensions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">ANSWER:  -- but the problem was that -- that in the meantime the very nice colleagues had to put somebody on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">ANSWER:  And after the teenis vacation trial was finished, he -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> was -- was not available, and that was it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And I had to study with that man, I didn’t like that man much, as you can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Now it turns out that he had way close relations with the SS apparatus, that man, the Fritz Wagner, you know, who ended that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">But he was uni -- unisancta of the Catholic organization, and that had a much influence at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">QUESTION:  D-Do you recall, if you can be a witness to this, that this experience of your father was very depressing for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Did he change because of this, or did -- was this just --
ANSWER:  Well, he tried to write books, but in a way it was reda -- really depressing for him
QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I would imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Did you know for, I don’t know, a long time, that you wanted to go into history, or was it --
ANSWER:  W-We certainly didn’t want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">We tried to avoid it, because of the family, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And Wolfgang, he started physics, and -- but he was still interested in philosophy and the- and philosophy of history, and suddenly he was a historian. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And I started German language, and everything, but suddenly I was a historian. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Maybe we had a -- in the years when the father was with our business, we also, all the time, helped him to write many books, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I don’t know, but anyhow, we both wer -- became historians, although we don’t wanted to become it. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Well that -- that happens, you know.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  Yes, the oldest one, he was archivist, but he had a -- certainly some trouble to gain a position, because it was -- he had to study, then later on, you know, he was already rather old, and what he -- when -- he lived on his whistle, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">The next one got a Protestant priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">QUESTION:  Interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So, once you started in your reluctant career, what did you start studying? </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Whe -- How -- How did you move into history? </span><span class="sentence" id="384">What was the --
ANSWER:  Well, we -- we would study many -- in two <span class="DLF">fields</span> , or two and a half <span class="DLF">fields</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and did Communistic, and as a second <span class="DLF">field</span> , history, and at first I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marburg</span> , and the only <span class="DLF">field</span> in history which was interesting, was Medieval history, and certainly modern history was also there. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">The Fritz Wagner, whom I didn’t like very much, as you can imagine -- although I had examinations with him, I’ll never forget it, because he was really fearful, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">In a way he didn’t -- he didn’t want to make blunders in the examination. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Now -- And by that I -- I got a Medievalist, and then I made my exam there. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I wrote a examination paper, which I deft -- I think quite interesting besides, on the development of the <span class="REGION">region</span> in the west of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> , which is to ca -- today called the naicowanda. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">But that didn’t fit into the theories of my professor, and he gave me only a B minus. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And I decided then I’Il leave that, and go to teebing, to Hans Rodefass, about that I went back to contemporary history, and certainly to the Tside cacheefta essensasencherm. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">That means the history of National Socialism, although I did my dissertation work on the nationality problem in the Hapsburg monarchy, and the period between 18 -- 1867 and 1907, which was quite interesting, and certainly had a lot to do with the German Czech relations at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">QUESTION:  I’m going to stop the tape now, so they can change tapes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">ANSWER:  It’s okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">QUESTION:  And we’|l take a slight break. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  Mr. Mommsen, during the break you started talking more about your own naiveté. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">So before we go back to your career, talk -- talk a little bit about what that reflection feels like, that you were so -- you say about yourself that you were so naive about what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">You didn’t notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">ANSWER:  Well, as a youngster, you wouldn’t notice so much, and we were not polit -- very political. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And if you are living in a situation where -- no-nobody would talk about that, then certainly some naiveté is arising. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I told that I d-didn’t know what Jews are, what Jewish life is, that in the post-war years there, it took me awhile to realize not only that there was the Holocaust, and the Jewish persecution, that was easy, but -- but that Jews were interesting individuals, you know, because you have to -- we’re living in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German little town</span> , Jews would d-disappear from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , you wouldn’t know who they -- where they -- wh-where are Jews, and even those Jews who lived there we-were not discernible, and were the -- they would cut all communications to the so-called Aryan population. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">By that, if you grow up as a kid, Jews didn't have any arriello -- idea of what that -- that was, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And certainly I was told that we were su-surviving as a -- as a -- babies, because of a Jewish professor, who was a junior colleggest -- trolegest, and knew what to do with early birds, and so on, and we knew that there was a lot of Jewish colleagues, and the father told us about that, but you know, that was no all reality of the Jews -- y-you didn’t know much about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I think that was very symptomatic for my age cohorder, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And that they certainly were told in the Hitler youth, there was a Jewish question something, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> , or somewhere, but they never realized that it’s our Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Certainly those people who were with the olderunder -- really understood what was going on inorise Crystal Night, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">They must have realized that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">That -- But that is also part of what I -- I mentioned earlier, of that incremental depolitization.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">QUESTION:  You mention in the break that you had gone into a <span class="BUILDING">kosher restaurant</span> , you didn’t even realize it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  You know, nobody had told me about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I didn’t -- I didn’t realize that --
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  -- bef -- before I was there, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">So it’s hard to --
ANSWER:  I didn’t have any pressure to this, not at all, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">But it’s hard to know what’s missing when it’s missing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">ANSWER:  A chit -- you know, the whole -- the whole time, mention of Jewish life had disappeared in our minds, and now that was no longer existing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">So, when did you come to decide that you would study the period of National Socialism? </span><span class="sentence" id="425">How did it happen that you decided that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">ANSWER:  Well, I decided on the one hand because we were influenced by Hans Roadface, who was running the -- the leading periodical, and also after I ta -- finished my Ph.D. there, I went into the Institute Ratied Catcheechta, that means the leading institute for contemporary history, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And certainly wat -- and I was primary -- primarily in that business. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">But think that’s not all, but it’s very symptomatic for our -- our ca -- generation that they just we -- were preoccupied to learn why the father generation had accepted the rule o-of Adolf Hitler you know, that was -- was a pressing issue, and therefore, many of my fellow students would also deal with -- especially the Wimayears, in order to understand the seizure of power later on, then we would enter also the second phase of the regime, after 1934, and studied that. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">That is, I think a typical process. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And the following generation then, would look into 19" century. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">What are the basic reasons for the German way -- for the deformation of German politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">That was when, signified by the so-called <span class="BUILDING">Beedafeld school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">QUESTION:  And how do you understand the -- th-the -- if -- if you could summarize the sort of historiography of what’s going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and how historians are trying to understand the Nazi era. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Are there very clear demarcations as you see them, in how people are studying this, and --
ANSWER:  Well, the deka -- a lot of <span class="DLF">demarcation lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">In our first [indecipherable] you know, in the early post-war, those people who dealt with that, even in journalism, or 1-in history, certainly professional historians had a apprehension against -- to doing contemporary history, they did that on account of some sort epilaga -- epilagactic position, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And then they have the dichotomy between the SS state on the one hand, you know, the suppression, the police state, the apparatus, and on the other hand the German resistance, which we call the other <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and in the midst were also some people, but you know, this tule -- this picture was a way [indecipherable] one. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And that was mixed then with the fear of totalitarian dictatorship, and the idea of the molithic structure of the regime, and the predominant role of Adolf Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">That was the old position, which I think was prevailing in through the middle -- into the end of the 60’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Now there happened one change that the American government returned the captured German files in 1967. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And our generation of [indecipherable] had the first time the opportunity to look really into the files, and not only in the selected documents, which we are typical for the Nuremberg trials, or living from memoirs of contemporaries and witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">We looked into the files, and we got a very different picture than that of the monolithic state, and so all the contradiction within a system, and that’s why the -- but then developed it -- a quite different understanding of how the regime functioned then. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">For instance, Hans Roadface or Caldidish baha [indecipherable] older generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And they also -- the so-called <span class="BUILDING">Functionalist school</span> emerged. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I belonged to the <span class="BUILDING">Functionalist school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I would certainly point it out that it -- it not sufficient only to look at the ideology on the one hand, and to -- to say that Hitler wrote his program down in the Mein Kampf, and then everything happened like that, it’s nonsense. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And that is also a apologetic element, just to put Hitler in the foreground all the time, because -- and our function was to show that the responsibility of what had happened, had to be put on broader sco -- shoulders, and that was, over there, some mechanisms of the -- the one hand, the -- the style of politics, and the perception of politics, which was specific Fascist, and a specific structure, which put Jews then what I call cumulative radicalization, which may explain the proceedings, or the -- the way Nazi policy took, and t -- that can be especially, I think shown with respect to the Jewish persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">QUESTION:  Let me ask -- L-Let’s go talk a little bit about --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">QUESTION:  -- the Functionalist - Intentionalist --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">QUESTION:  -- debate. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">On the one had, the Intentionalist can often be considered to be Apologists, but there are many Jews, there are many victims who are very sympathetic with that view.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">ANSWER:  Well, I know that, you know --
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER:  -- and especially the Israelis, because certainly the Israelis also have that -- that [indecipherable] reason for that one-ness that the -- the Israelian historiography has been developed by German professors who were mainly representatives of the history of ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">That has been continued by men like Talman, and the others, I know them, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And certainly also the background of the Jewish religion is very favored for history of ideas, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">But that, yeah they have still today, problems to -- to do a simple social history. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">But mainly they are -- they are working in history of ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Therefore, they have one bias in that direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Secondly, you know, the strong connection between notion of the creation of the state of Israel, and the role anti-Semitism stands in the background. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And so had sa -- the survivors, they have problems, I can understand that, to -- to accept what already was a conflict with Hana-ah, and to accept the trivial elements in that policy. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">It’s very, very comprehensible that they don’t want to have these very trivial elements as elements of explanation, and -- and so forth, the Functionalists have a difficult time if they talk to those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Although we say one can’t explain everything where the ideological factor, or the personal factor Hitler, and they have to put in that element of bureaucratic competition, and so on, and no -- but you know the whole -- whole controversy between Functionalists and Intentionalists is coming to an end, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Eruda Bower says that, and -- and sometimes Karl Hiberg would say that he is a Structuralist, and -- and what Chris Browning did in writing the [indecipherable] 101, he suddenly got a -- got a notion that it wouldn’t work with the Intentionalist explanation, which he originally had, you know, I never forgot, and that was [indecipherable] debate with them, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">At that time, he was in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="464">But today, most of the researchers in a way of taking up our Functionalist -- Functionalist elements of explanation, and everybody gets aware that Hitler was not a man who was -- had -- had that [indecipherable] personality, you know, that this was a merth, and that things are even more -- were even worse, because there are many people who -- who pushed the process, I think, atafond, and certainly this viewpoint increases a responsibility, and a moral responsibility of the nation, versus a specific Nazi perpetrators, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And my generation, we fought against that position, that there are only very few people besides of Himmler, and [indecipherable] Hitler, that they -- seduced, is the term. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">For fear they seduced the German nation, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">That was your -- the main argument. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And we started to -- just to get rid of that crazy idea, I wanted to show how that could happen, I certainly -- that was, and still is our question, how could that happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And certainly I would argue then -- your argument -- I can’t go to the next generation and say there was some stupid, crazy individual called Adolf Hitler, that’s why they killed five million Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">I don’t think that this is sufficient. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">It seems to be real plausible, but then it’s not plausible by -- because why could one man do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And so on, we’re -- in a way we have to describe the background on which Hitler could then have that function. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And so far, I think in the fear -- the misunderstanding of both <span class="NPIP">fronts</span> , I think have overcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">There’s just the next polarization between younger historians who want -- who would go back to some ideological explanation, said as Uri Shalbud, and the other ones who were some experience and say, well, you will have the same development as we had at -- that he originally stud-studied all the time, the Nazi [indecipherable] longer, and we got a idea that it’s not so important. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Certainly there was a basic anti-Jewish resentment, no question, but that there had been other mechanisms we share, what then may explain the perversion of a civilicized nation into a -- a apparatus of criminals, and that is still the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">QUESTION:  Is -- Is the functional -- Was the functional -- I don’t know, my study of history would s - would suggest to me that this is a very odd dichotomy. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I don’t know of any other event where all of this -- where you have this -- is it a kind of fake dichotomy? </span><span class="sentence" id="478">How do you not talk about ideas, and how do you not talk about the structure in terms of which these ideas function?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  That’s okay, but you know, there is some difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">You know, the terms have been coined by Jim Mason at a conference near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lornan</span> many years ago, when there was -- was a clear cut, I think, distinction of the -- of the explanation between something like a history of ideas, and something like social history, that’s different, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And so far, that was also related to the explanation of the <span class="DLF">field</span> , and certainly the whole metalogical difference wouldn’t play such a big role if they wa-wouldn’t have been loden with some role -- with some moral legacies, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Because the Germans need a strong Hitler, because if Hitler would be weak, they can’t [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I never forgot that famous Louden conference, where there was a discussion where Hitler could preserve his rule for so long, it was very long, in a way, while he was -- I coined that formula, in some respects, a weak dictator.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  And certainly I wasn’t tact all the time, because u -- I always thought I would defend Hitler, I didn’t want to -- want to, but turn out that with the -- that the emotional element, that was very symptomatic, and then I said, really, look, if you have a dictatorship, then it’s really likely that perseveres. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Take Idi Amin. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Oh, I was already wint by that, because that violated the chair of national pride. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">We want to have a strong Hitler, not Idi Amin, now that -- that shouldn’t be done, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">That’s a basic background, all that, and to understand that, one has to come back to what we talked about, where the Germans would take the personality of Hitler out of the responsibility of the crimes and decay, because they preverse them -- pre-preserve them something like icon for their national identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Now, in 1945, they certainly got aware that this was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And not -- now the emotion turned against Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">ANSWER:  And if then somebody like Hans Mommsen [indecipherable] the other week in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , Hitler was not only the subject, but also the object of politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">You get immediately a very angry criticisms, even by -- by very good historians. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Karl Dietrich baha -- he immediately wrote and said, “How can you say that Hitler’s objects are [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Well, why not, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">If you talk that -- If you talk about that in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , it’s not so difficult, be -- but there is a -- apologetic element, the emotional elements, which I think are guided the debate, and also the research. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And that’s why we have that -- that’s not only a metalogic distinction, or dim -- different starting point, but they had then this controversy between Functionalists and Intentionalists. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">That is certainly gone with the next generation, which doesn’t have that necessity to defend in a way, indirectly, the Germans [indecipherable] pointing out the manipulative character of Nazi dictatorship and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">But they needed, in order to believe that they had been seduced. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Certainly the opposite was true, they made Hitler, they in turn wanted to use him certainly then Hitler used them, you know, but that still proves with which certainly they -- nobody would reject them outright, but th-they are not very convenient. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And then so far, I think I am still not too old fashioned [indecipherable] an old historian, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">The next generation certainly doesn’t have that problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">They don’t see also this specific constellation under which we developing contemporary history.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">QUESTION:  Let me ask you about a quote from your piece, and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vimar</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">You say that the Nazi system of rule completely lacked internal coherence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">QUESTION:  Can you explain that for our --
ANSWER:  Well, you know, there was a Sherman Oaks, one of the leading English experts in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , and he talked about the re-organization of the party in 1932, in December 1932, immediately before the seizure of power, and he then said that from then on, they had 37 different <span class="REGION">territories</span> , with a rather independent Gauleiter, and so far, as they can do what they want. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And you know, the problem is -- is not coordination within the system. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Everybody can act, everybody can make initiatives and so on, as far as that stays, as they accept the authority, or the prestige abi -- Adolf Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And the thing we have to do with the specific style of Nazi politics -- it’s very difficult, especially for a European say, Americans are better, to understand this regime, which doesn’t have any institutionalized governmental board, or some representation. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">But after 1937, we don’t have a cabinet, there is no political discourse between the different ministries. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">We don’t have that on the <span class="REGION">party side</span> either. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">There is nothing which would integrate diverging political interests, in sa -- in the -- the very diverging politic interests are then -- are brought to conflict or not, is by personal feuds. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">That’s the reason why everybody among the Nazi regime hates the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And some of the later Gauleiter would say if Hitler -- Himmler comes into my <span class="REGION">territory</span> , my gow, I will imprison him, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">They hated -- They hated each other, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And the whole system is built on that -- watha -- non-structure. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">At the same time, you have a system of non-communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">If you were in the high position of that regime, let’s say you are the secretary of state in your [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">You know something, but you don’t know everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">The case of Mr. Kritchinger, who was a -- a member of the confessor -- confessing <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , but he -- he was present at the Wannsee conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Was really took -- Because he didn’t get a clear cut picture of the Holocaust before, I think the middle of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And then he wanted to get dismissed, and the lama said, “No, no, stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">It would be better if you stay here,” you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And there was a systematic non-communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">In the newspaper, you wouldn’t get the necessary information of what was really going on, and then there was the so-called shtimmelsburchter report of the securities service, made by -- these so -- should in a way replace them -- lack of information for the leading functionaries within this history -- s -- within the system. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">But after they became inconvenient, because of too many inconvenient trusay they also were no longer permitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Where did you get information from? </span><span class="sentence" id="530">It’s very easy to read today the d-diary of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goebbels</span> , and you see that even Goebbels, who is at a [indecipherable] sometimes at a [indecipherable] the system, because they’re changed all the time, he isn’t very well informed about important ada -- aspects of politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And that is a -- cer -- specific nature of that regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And we have th -- we have also a travelma, to prove who was then really responsible for the onicol, because that happened, and there was no precise mechanism. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And you know, I point that out, no-not only -- not to say that people were not responsible for what they were doing, you know, but to explain why there was no opposition, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And it -- In the question of the Holocaust, there could have been opposition on the side of the army, or other groups, not because they were not anti-Jewish, I wouldn’t say that, but because of th -- the ta -- c-competing interests, because Jews the -- a certain amount of -- of manpower and resources in order to do the -- the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Cosponick has shown that in 1943, they had 300 men just to liquidate Jews in the east -- and the whole army at that time has only 1,000,800. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="537">But under those specific ambivalent condition, where you didn’t have any institutional set of politics, then something like Holocaust could occur. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">That’s a tatrol out of the analysis, and I’ve had this also a conclusion which may have -- be some importance for future events, because genocidal acts usually would come into being, if there is no clear cut command structure, not the other way around. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">If we look at <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> , we know that we will -- certainly that could be it -- not -- no comparable level, but you know, certainly, if we look at the Holocaust, we also look helpul existence are like, which would then be a -- able to be per-perverted in that direction, that there is no protest against the destruction of all the foundations of law, and destruction of all the radius, which is certainly accompanying the implementation of the Holocaust, according to my conviction.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">QUESTION:  But that is somewhat counter to what one might think, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">ANSWER:  Well --
QUESTION:  That there -- Is there no notion that this is what somebody wants to be done, even if there’s no clear cut order?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">ANSWER:  There is certainly -- well, that’s -- the long run, they got accustomed to get rid of the Jews, and suddenly they learned, under the conditions of the <span class="REGION">occupied Soviet territory</span> , where the recent study said a -- under certain conditions, then certainly then, see that it’s possible, that it’s the easiest thing just to kill those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">First, before that, they want to have some reservations, solutions, that turn out to be impossible, and so on, and at the end it was for them, the easy d -- way, to kill the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And after they had started with that, then certainly the German bureaucratic perfectionism got into the business, and then they had the systematic liquidation of every Jewish women and kids which they could find in <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , or elsewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">You know, that is really in -- that is -- well, impresses me a lot, and well there you have then the marriage between Nazi fanatism, and Prussian state tradition, and this terrible affect -- affectivity of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Other <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> would have just said, well that in -- why -- we -- we -- th-that -- that’s not interesting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">But the Germans, and the way they are on a problem, then they do that up to the way and -- and they hold icemen so he shows that that 1s still -- that business of killing the Hungarian Jews, after he had a counter order, obviously a counter order by Himmler, you know, that’s very symptomatic for that process. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And it -- so far, we have not only to do with anti-Semitic moderation, but also with attitudes which are things stemming from the Prussian state tradition, in a way. -- </span><span class="sentence" id="549">murdered Fromme, certainly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">QUESTION:  And do you really think there’s something very special about the German state, and the -- and Prussian history, given all the help that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> got doing this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">ANSWER:  Well, I wouldn’t overestimate the impact of national history on the process, but certainly there is something like a -- a -- the -- well -- that has been called by -- from the authoritarian character, and the authoritarian character plays a role, I think, f -- to fulfill the expectation by the Nazis and by Hitler, you know, th-they then just did, and you can see that with their example, the Reich’s Crystal Night, and all the -- the German population protested way much against the violent acts in the night of the ninth of November already, and the eighth, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">But then the Gestapo gave the explicit order that they should take into custody 20, or 20 thous -- 25,000 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">That was a state measure, they accepted that, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="554">This is a strange element. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Law and order can work under certain conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">That they criticize the Nazi policy, but in -- then also can support Nazi policy. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And in a way it did, especially if you look how they then proceeded in getting these European Jewry from the last isle in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , or elsewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">You know, it’s really nonsense, nobody would have done that in the whole world. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">In that respect I think it’s uniquely German. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Maybe the Russians, and some people there have a -- have some heritage from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to do that in their day, if they start then to bring it to a -- toa -- I think complete, and that’s, I think one specific element. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">But, on the other hand, we’re starting to study what the French police did, and maybe they count a very depressing results [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  Do you think that people -- that historians now are more accepting of your view of -- of Hitler?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">ANSWER:  Well, I think it’s gone -- it’s -- everybody is of that opinion, because w -- you know, we know more documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">We know that Hitler didn’t -- didn’t -- he was a ideological motor all the time, especially in the Jewish question. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">But, on the other hand, he didn’t always push things ahead, and now it turns out that also the Wannsee conference has to be interpreted in a somewhat different context. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">The main problem of Heydrich, besides of getting, or increasing his competence for the so-called Jewish question, was that he didn’t want to proceed with the Nuremberg laws, and hi -- difference between Jews and half Jews, and Jews living in mixed marriages, you know, that very complicated system, to distinguish between a more assimilated, and a less assimilating [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Because, certainly on the one hand, a party from the star wanted to include everybody who was of Jewish descent, up to the quarter Jew, and to the -- all the first -- the [indecipherable] exclusion from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and later on the liquidation. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And the problem arose that Hitler didn’t want to change the Nuremberg laws, and he was not following the suggestions of Heydrich, and Himmler, and the so-called mishling question, the -- the k -- the question of -- how do you say that in English?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">QUESTION:  [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  That means a half, quarter, and so on, Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And Heydrich invited the ministers to the Wannsee conference, to decuss -- discuss that issue, and to get approval of the ministries, and the Reich chancellor, which were involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">In order then to press on Hitler, to get the approval to include the half Jews, and the Jews living in mixed marriages. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And Hitler at that point was a -- was something like a brake. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Certainly motivation is very clear, he -- he didn’t change -- want to change in later years, anything, and he thought it terribly inp -- unpopular if he would touch the assimilated Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And he was less strict in that issue than Heydrich, and Himmler and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">That gives to the Wannsee conference certainly, quite anew meaning, and Eichmann, who was expert on the mishlings question, that means the question of half and quarter Jews, he wanted to di -- let disappear his role. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And by that, he over -- he pointed at the ongoing liquidation in that famous speech delivered by Heydrich, wh -- and now -- by now we know very well that Heydrich had in mind what was going on with the construction of that so-called rollbarn defore, that was a big <span class="DLF">street</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> and -- and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And from there he had a -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish labor camps</span> , and where he practized quote unquote, annihilation through labor, and that is then mentioned in this speech by Heydrich. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Because 20 days later he would, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , still talk about all the deportation, all the 11,000,000 Jews -- European Jews, to the <span class="REGION">Icemeer region</span> , where the Gestapo wanted to have a -- it’s own <span class="REGION">territory</span> , and a continuing the archy period in the <span class="BUILDING">gulag</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">You know, that was really simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">But in the ensuing weeks, suddenly everything changed, and then they did not he-hesitate then, to implement the systematic liquidation of the European Jews, but not so much at the Wannsee conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And you know, and so far, still the central part of that history, opened to different interpretations by now, but certainly that doesn’t change anything in the very terrible development, and the criminal character of that, but it makes it, I think, a bit more comprehensible. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And certainly the problem still is that -- that it’s not only Hitler who is doing that, certainly he’s supporting that all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">The discussion is to what extent Hitler was informed. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Certainly I -- I wouldn’t say that Hitler was not, but on the other hand, he didn’t want to know too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And therefore, there was not too much discourse between the underlings and him, Hitler, as everybody assumed. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">But the -- obviously that was not necessarily the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Hitler was living in the ideological world, he all the time was characterized by a flight from reality, and he was not a man who looked at things day to day, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">That was a original position when I started that business of Nazi history. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Well, is that some sufficient explanation of your question?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">QUESTION:  Yes, you did. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Let me ask you about your involvement with studying Hannah Arant, because you seem much more sympathetic than many historians.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">ANSWER:  [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Yes --
QUESTION:  Which --
ANSWER:  Well, at that time, this was very difficult to get anybody who was ready to talk about Hannah Arant in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and -- forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And also Hans Wartfels, he was a clear cut opponent of Hannah Arant. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Why’d I think Hannah Arant had some good points? </span><span class="sentence" id="595">We know today that this was not very reliable, that he used the book of Raoul Hillberg to a good part, and that he -- that she, you know, all the time tends to -- to overshoot the mark, you know, and so on, but in general I think she was right with the main thesis [indecipherable] available. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And all that certainly was a problem that is so difficult to understand for the survivor side. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I do understand that very well, while that issue on the -- Raoul -- of the Jewish council, I think have been otherwise too [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">But the main problem certainly is that, in fact, Iseman was very active, but he was on the other hand not a man who [indecipherable] and new research has found out that Iseman comes into that business first because of the resettlement of the ethnic Germans in 1939, because of the German-Soviet agreement. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And he is responsible for the interpretation of the pillars, and the Jews, and other groups from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vladica</span> , in order to resettle the Germans there. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And there they make their first experiences, and by that they are working for the establishment of the greater German Reich, and that’s not only that negative element, and later on you know everything 1n that [indecipherable] resettlement in [indecipherable] affairs, and it didn’t work, but then something like an overcompensation down there, work very hard and honor -- at least -- at least, to implement the Holocaust, they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">You know, I think that’s a psychological mechanism, it’s very important to give an interpretation of the group of the -- of the local and regional perpetrators.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">QUESTION:  How do you understand -- I have seen, over the years, not a lessening of anger at her -- at Hannah Arant, but in some sense an enlargement of the anger. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">When the book came out about her relationship with Heideger, it gave people even more reason to --
ANSWER:  Well, but change, the -- the other year, I have been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , they had on a scolley conference on Hannah Arant, and they took over the admiration of Hannah Arant, which is I think symptomatic for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , we would be more critical in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And her problem certainly is that both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> don’t understand that Hannah Arant is basically influenced by the [indecipherable] your Conservative -- tism. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Which 1s different from bigots. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">One has to know that in order to understand Hannah Arant. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">In all her theories, you know, of the philasinhite, of the loneliness of man, and then there comes back the -- a model -- that the Jews are the model for the world population. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Well, and if you look in a German idea, there’s philosophy of the 19" century of Fishter, and all these people, you suddenly get it, that’s her. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">But she t -- I think masschoserv has to be a pragmatic philosopher, she 1s not. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Therefore --
QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">No, she’s an idealist -
ANSWER:  She is -- Well, about an -- with that crazy mixture, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="612">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">ANSWER:  And a -- a -- th-- the easer -- it is -- don’t understand that either, I think we -- I -- according to my opinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I am not a specialist for Hannah Arant, but I met her. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I never forget when I met her, because I was invited by American history department of the <span class="BUILDING">Columbia University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">When was that? </span><span class="sentence" id="617">In 70 -- in ’78, I think or ’74. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And my wife was there, and that was in affecta club of the <span class="BUILDING">Columbia University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And they had very bad organizer, sadly it turned out that also Henry Freidlander was invited to deliver-liver a lecture, and then they decided that we had each a half an hour rather than hour lectures. [</span><span class="sentence" id="620">indecipherable] care. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And there were about 200 people there, once was very lively, and then suddenly somebody entered the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , that was Hannah Arant. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I saw they knew her from the television, that was very clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">The whole atmosphere changed immediately, the- the talk silenced down. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">She was there, you know, that was -- she had a radiation, no problem, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Then we had to give our papers, then she said, “Well, both papers are very bad.” </span><span class="sentence" id="626">This is wrong, that is wrong, she [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">But anyhow -- And after that -- that was finished, the debate, I went with Wilfreda to her, and said hello, and she invited us immediately to go to her <span class="BUILDING">flat</span> that was in <span class="DLF">Riverside Drive</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And I forgot that she took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> for that 300 meters or something, but that was the time there that was still very dangerous, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And then we were sitting there until two in the night, and that was- that didn’t change much, there were all the papers of her husband still there, the name of the husband at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> , and we had a very, very interesting talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And she was really good, I never forgot it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="631">QUESTION:  Can you talk a little bit more about what you talked about, and what it was like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">ANSWER:  Not a problem, it’s difficult to say what we talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Certainly we reported a lot about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , German history and so on, and possibly she was a receiver more than -- I have to talk with my wife, she is better in recollecting these things, I don’t know, but I only recollect that th -- the -- the graduation of her personality, and on the other hand, you know, she had learned in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that openness of the American academics, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Immediately you talk about what you’re doing, what you want to do, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">She was really good, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">QUESTION:  So you were impressed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">ANSWER:  I was very much impressed, and also from the surrounding, these many books and papers, who knows, was a lit -- anything but orderly, and I think she didn’t change too much since her husband died, and well -- and so far, I was very much impressed by her. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">That didn’t much influence what -- what my -- because I -- I wrote about the Eichmann trial bukfa earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">ANSWER:  Th-That was far before she -- I met her then, and I was not influenced personally, but I think that she had some good points at -- at that book.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">QUESTION:  Had she read what you had written?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="647">QUESTION:  Tell me how you -- We all -- I don’t know what I want to say, suffered through the Goldhagen controversy. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Is there -- Was there something about that book that both took on the Intentionalists, and the Functionalists together, trying to come up with the [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Well, it was quite good, because you know, there was a [indecipherable] written by -- what is this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> destroy, and again, and a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> -- and he -- bec -- and he criticized then, or could ha -- was criticized to be a hyper-Intentionalist. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And that was quite true. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And -- But that all my enemies, you know, say -- opponents, they would then argue with Functionalist arguments against Goldhagen. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And that was in a way, the end of the <span class="BUILDING">Intentionalist school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Even if you take what the -- what the -- what Chris Browning said there, you know what, all the Functionalists are the ones against Goldhagen, and Goldhagen in a way, you know, by -- by expanding the Intentionalist position to the utmost, you know, it des -- he destroyed it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And so far, it was in the -- it was quite interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I know him very well, I met him first in ’85, in a conference which was run in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berkeley</span> by Gary Feldman, and there he delivered a paper on the [indecipherable] republic, and he was very, very critical about [indecipherable] republican said there was still extreme anti-Semitism, which he would deny today, and he had, for instance, this strange conclusion that in the Secret Service, there are more party members than have been in the Third Reich. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">You know, so I mean, that may be true, and so far, as nobody could enter the Secret Service in the Third Reich, there was no member of the Nazi party. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">But you know, he really thought that the [indecipherable] republic was completely Nazi party, and anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And then later on, you -- now, his publisher told him not to tell that, and Jerry Feldman -- Gary Feldman should publish that conference, I ne -- I met him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford</span> , and said, ““What’s with the conference?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="658">Yes,” he said, “I don’t have yet the paper of -- of Daniel Goldhagen.” </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I say, “You will never get it,” you know, he would -- he’s [indecipherable] himself, he’s doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And I never forgot I said to him, “Well, Daniel, if you go to my <span class="BUILDING">class</span> and [indecipherable] on the other hand that we are sympathetic to you, they wouldn’t accept that, you would have hard time.” </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And that impressed him a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And then I met him at a conference in -- on Hannah Arant, and others -- other things in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And we are sitting on a panel and he attacked me sharply and [indecipherable] republic, I never forgot it. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">On the same <span class="DLF">line</span> , you know, that anti-Semitism is still there, and there -- course, when I was answering, I said to the -- to the [indecipherable] also, you got it from the audience, anti-Semitism is still hanging, you know, it was really -- it was a really not a very friendly climate. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Then I said to the audience, well people, you must know the German Jew, the younger generation is doing anything to study the Holocaust, and to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and to improve the German Jewish relations, it’s not fair if you say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And I never forget that someday you tha -- that mud change, you know, that was clear, that this was no longer the topic, German anti- Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And then he told them -- I invited him for dinner, and he told me what he wanted to do in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the whole [indecipherable] things, so and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I know him. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Know? </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Well, in a way, I glad that he got a prisoner of his own thesis, and of the whole affair, because I don’t see that he has an academic future by that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="672">ANSWER:  Because, as y -- he -- I know, the father very well, ri -- when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> , I met the father several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">That was in ’72, and I also met that -- the very young Daniel, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">It’s -- It’s -- In a way it’s a pity, and the book 1s so terribly bad, from the -- from the scholarly viewpoint. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">It’s not a -- so much a problem with the position, but he doesn’t know anything about folkish anti-Semitism, and you know, it’s quite interesting, where did he got his idea of the -- how 1s that anti-Semitism called, e-el --
QUESTION:  Eliminationists.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">ANSWER:  Eliminatri -- Eliminatri, or Eliminationists anti-Semitist. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">That’s Julius Langbean.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">ANSWER:  But he never read la -- Jultus Langbean, the [indecipherable] that very impressive and -- and very popular anti-Semitic book of the [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">He never read it. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">He got it by Georgie Massey. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">There he got some information of Langbean that was also a bit one- sided, but well Georgie was a wonderful man, anyhow, and then he took that up without really knowing what he took up, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Because he never understood the context of the early -- that means the li -- 19" century Wagnerian anti-Semitism, which was strongly connected with the idea that the Jews are, in -- was -- some respects, a model nation for the German one, and then they got the idea that the German nation can’t be built, except of the elimination of the Jews from the German nation, so that -- that was not meant in the sense of killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">Now see, all this assumes [indecipherable] he’s as bad that he -- he c- he -- he doesn’t -- he isn’t able to read German text correctly, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">His interpretation of one quotation of pishta Israel is really terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">He wants them to -- to say that there already was a idea of a systematic killing of choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">But, on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , where you have that, in the fergush movement, he doesn’t mention it e-either, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="688">But you know, that’s a story for -- o-of itself, and the reason was that he discovered a bit late that Chris Browning had already written the book he wanted to write.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="689">QUESTION:  So he had to write something else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">ANSWER:  And by that, he added that part on the 19" century, and added that part on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> , and the Death Marches.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">QUESTION:  What do you think of George Massey’s work as a sort of culturalist orien?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">ANSWER:  Well, George Massey, I knew him very well, we were together at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , and he was a man one can’t but adore, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">But his book has some weaknesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">He is -- He is a historian of th -- of ideas, you know, and he also, I think, over exenderency anti-Semitic issues, Or -- In a way he 1s a forerunner of Daniel Goldhagen, in a way, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And he has a lot of material that’s very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I wouldn’t accept his a little bit monocausal interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">ANSWER:  And certainly he is also one of those people who -- who if they have anti-Semitism, then they think they have to explain the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">That’s not my opinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">But it’s indispensable, it’s very good at that time, but he published that, that was pioneering, and far better than everything which existed on the history of the German anti-Semitism it’s quite clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">He put that in a broader politic context, you know, I can’t have a lot of positive arguments, but in the principle -- principle, mathological point, I would say present research is -- 1s, I think, has developed farther, and couldn’t -- would avoid to have this harda monocausal, and mainly I -- illogical interpretation, and but -- but I recommend to read these books, anyhow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">QUESTION:  D-Do you -- Cause I didn’t speak with him about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">When Daniel Goldhagen’s book came out, was George sympathetic to the book, or not? </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I don’t --
ANSWER:  I just don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I don’t think so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">QUESTION:  You don’t know? </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I doubt it, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">ANSWER:  I don’t think so, because he must have seen the weaknesses, because George knows the material very well, you know, and what he’s writing about in 19" century, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">No, Geor-George must have wudwich senicher undehenderben kauf to sunwichlong, can you translate that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="710">QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">ANSWER:  D’you know, you -- I said, if you are upset, then you -- then you’ll say that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">He can’t accept that -- can’t have accepted that, I think, because of the weakness of scholener research, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">He was a really good scholar.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And how are you -- h-how do you view Raoul Hillberg’s work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">ANSWER:  Well, that was a pioneering study, pioneering study. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Unfortunately, it hasn’t been translated to the German pur before 1982, and you know the reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">It’s not only the German disinterest, and it is today indispensable, you know, as a first book. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">But, on the other hand, the recent research, you know, did a lot more. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Awhile ago, in 1932, I invited him to deliver a lecture in -- in my <span class="BUILDING">university</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buckholm</span> , telling him, if you could enter- reclude the resettlement policy of Heinrich Himmler, in 1939 - 1940, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And he answered he couldn’t do that, then he would deliver what he usually delivers, you know, his very competent survey on how the implementation of the Holocaust occurred step by step. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And then -- I met him in 1933, we -- at a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , at that conference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">QUESTION:  You mean 792, we’re talking about 92. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">You said ’32.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">ANSWER:  93. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">N -- I know, ’93, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="727">QUESTION:  °93, right, the conference, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">ANSWER:  Another famous conference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">ANSWER:  Where it was a main issue, what is the future of Holocaust research? </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Then he said the future of the Holocaust research lies in the context. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Where was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Because today we see that we have to connect that with the other polit -- <span class="DLF">policy fields</span> , especially the terminization and resettlement policy of Himmler, in order to understand why that could be performed without any significant opposition. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And that makes it then also better comprehensible for next generations, who have difficulties to study only the little bit isolated <span class="DLF">Jewish field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Those are my position -- my <span class="DLF">field</span> here, I thought I should be the generalist a little bit, in the midst of all these special -- specialists, and experts on certain <span class="DLF">fields</span> of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">They are far better than I am, but to know my role should be also in the lexus to give a little bit more the general context, because in the next generations will be ready only to see this aspect, and I think -- well that’s -- I continue the idea by Mr. Raoul Hillberg, you know, I adore him, he’s a really good man.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Tell me about the emergence of the Klemperer diaries in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , y -- in your lecture to the <span class="BUILDING">Leo Beck Institute</span> , you said that it was actually a bigger best seller than the Goldhagen book.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">ANSWER:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">QUESTION:  How do you account for that? </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I mean, what do you think about these diaries?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">ANSWER:  Well, the diaries are very impressive, especially for those youngsters, and for those students who want to realize how the living condition of Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and posey with other parts of Europe at that time, really were. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Certainly he is living in a mixed marriage, that’s -- a mixed po -- the -- Polish marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">By that, he even certainly has better conditions than the average Jews, that’s quite clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">But anyhow, what gets -- what gets a vivid, I think, picture of how -- what the Jewish situation in Nazi Germany was. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And that’s helps for the youngsters, I think, to understand what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">S -- You know, for the first time, they get an interpretation of Jews, and Jewish life, and how they had, or tried to survive, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And because it’s translated by a man who belongs to the m -- basically to the German culture, and so on, it’s obviously easier to understand that, anyhow, that belongs to that new wave of sensitivity towards the Jewish question, which also was to be seen in the “Schindler’s List” film.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">QUESTION:  When -- When you read the diaries, and you think back upon your saying about yourself that you were naive. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Now, I understand you were a child, and he was an adult person, so I’m not trying to compare your naiveté, and his la -- so-called lack of it, but it was fascinating to me how much he figured out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">ANSWER:  Yes, a --
QUESTION:  Even given where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">It seems really extraordinary.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">ANSWER:  Well, that’s right, yes, but I must atsee as a child I didn’t -- I didn’t hear that at the -- and- and -- and I think in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , that didn’t -- that didn’t occur too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">At least I don’t know, you know, I --
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">ANSWER:  -- and, d’you know, when I was growing up, in order to see something, you know, the Jews had disappeared to the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , there was nothing left, and by that, I’m a bad witness in that respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="756">QUESTION:  But it is interesting to see those diaries, because it’s clear that 1f you were adult person, and you would take the information that was coming in if you thought about it, which is what you said before, if you actually thought about it, you -- you’d know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">ANSWER:  That’s right, or at least know what the general direction was like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="759">ANSWER:  That’s right, that’s no question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="760">QUESTION:  So it’s quite a --
ANSWER:  And then so far, it’s a -- 1t’s an explanation, you know, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And certainly --
QUESTION:  An explanation of what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="762">ANSWER:  An explana -- no, it’s -- it’s not an explanation of the attitudes of the population, you’re right, but it’s an explanation of how the isolation came into being, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="763">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="764">ANSWER:  I think that they don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">QUESTION:  There’s often, when people talk about the Holocaust, nor -- regular people, including some historians, but --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">QUESTION:  They talk about this as a unique event.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="767">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="768">QUESTION:  And from what I read about your work, that would be hard-hardly a word that you would use, because you want to talk about the Holocaust in context.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">ANSWER:  Yes, that’s right, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="770">QUESTION:  So, can you tell me what you think is so problematic about this use of the word, uniqueness, and what it -- what it destroys.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="771">ANSWER:  I wouldn’t say it’s problematic, but you know, if I study historical events, I don’t study them for their u-uniqueness, but in order to learn from that, to have a better understanding of comparable, or prospeels, or opposite situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And by that, that category of uniqueness is not very variable, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And, well certainly there is an u -- u-uniqueness insofar as this systematic liquidation of millions of people in the 20" century. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">It’s incomparable to other developments. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">But I’m -- I’m always a bit cautious for what -- what uniqueness can mean, you know -- you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Or, the other day I have been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yucatan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="777">What [indecipherable] with those populations. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Well, it took them a century or two, the Germans did that within two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">That is maybe the uniqueness, that means our century. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">But the size of killing whole people, they maybe not so ni -- u-unique if you take in comparison to size of populations today, and in earlier periods. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And so far, I would also have a principle objection to use the term unique, because in a way, we don’t much about what is really unique.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">QUESTION:  We don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">ANSWER:  We don’t know much about, compare -- well, history is a very broad business, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="784">QUESTION:  Is a very?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="785">ANSWER:  A very broad --
QUESTION:  Broad business.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">ANSWER:  -- experience, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Well, you know, would have been in ancient societies, and so far, but that’s not a very important point. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">For me, it’s not a principle question, whether the -- the pate or the uniqueness. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">But certainly, it’s only from a German viewpoint, the average German viewpoint’s only -- it’s necessary to -- to connect that with the question of the murder of the Soviet prisoners of war, or the murder of Slav people, and Gypsies, and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">You know, that’s quite clear ba -- th -- by that, it gets more comprehensible. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And -- And if you look at that in order to show the pre-conditions for any pre-ju-jub -- any genocidal policy, you know, then it shouldn’t isolate that, and so far, the term uniqueness is not very helpful, but I wouldn’t re -- wouldn’t reject the -- that on the other hand, this is a unique event, which isn’t comparable directly with the [indecipherable | gulag under Stalinism, and so on, although it | -- it lies on the same level. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">They are -- We will discuss, I think, in future years a little bit, to what extent the -- the German perpetrators learned from -- from the local anti-Semitic populations in the east, and the Russians in the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">You know, the death marches are an invention by a Soviet -- by the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">They did that with their own people. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And then the German suddenly came to the idea to do it also, first with prisoners of wars, and at -- at the end, with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> inmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">That’s Soviet, the idea of that in -- can -- let -- march people about, hundreds and kilometers, was very familiar in a -- start in this period. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And so far, sometimes there are comparabilities which are -- shouldn’t be precluded by accepting the unique character of the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="798">QUESTION:  Let -- Let me push this uniqueness just a little bit, be-because I -- there are certainly debates about -- and you take it on, though not in these terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">The Holocaust is about the Jews, the Jewish experience is unique. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And then there’s a -- a view that there’s a universal way to look at the Holocaust, that there are many victims during the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">The Jews may have been the major, or the primary ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">How -- How do you think it’s best to actually look at this event?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="803">ANSWER:  Well, I would say -- would take up the argument that 1 -- on account of a -- a -- quite a lot of reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Some is certainly the traditional occ-Occidental anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">The Jews were killed, and the others not, just because the Nazis didn’t have enough time to kill the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And my friend Kurt Salley, he would talk about the top of the iceman to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Where’s the iceberg, or where --
QUESTION: <span class="ENV_FEATURES"> Iceberg</span> , yes, [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Iceberg, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And I mentioned that, at a talk to -- and now I got about the resettlement policy, you know, it’s quite the -- after -- there was some compensation mechanism which [indecipherable] at first met the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And suddenly they are the -- the prejudice, and anti-Judaism, and not only a distinct anti-Semitic philosophy was responsible, that the selection was then made, and a lot of other factors. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">But that - in -- in the long run, that wouldn’t have been an isolated phenomenon, they would have killed other groups, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">So th -- it was in a way, to put it in question marks, the easiest to kill the Jews, because they didn’t get opposition from their local populations, and you know, and you know, and you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">But the tendency to kill other groups as well, is unmistakably t-there. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And it so far, you know, you can say there was a uniqueness on their -- within the general picture, there was something like a uniqueness, like maybe kind of ca -- try to put that in that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And there is something which certainly explains that the -- the Jews were killed foremost, and the others anyway survived, although killing processes were underway all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="815">QUESTION:  There is --
ANSWER:  Is that a sufficient answer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="816">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">There is a way in which -- when I read your stuff, and I think about reading other people’s material, that one gets the feeling that Nazism is either self-mutilating or suicidal, that in the end it would eat itself up with death.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="818">ANSWER:  That’s my thesis, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">So now, in the last months of the -- of the war, you know, they suddenly said, we don’t need only racial homogeneity, we need only political homogeneity, and started to kill everybody in this time, 10 thousands of Germans, either, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And then so far, you know, that was symptomatic for that form of -- of -- that style of politics.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="821">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="822">ANSWER:  You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="823">If you -- If you have politics which are unable to have something like a lasting compromise, and then you have only destruction as the alternative, you know, that’s really --
QUESTION:  Tell me what you think about the emergence of movies like “Schindler’s List’, and television films and this sort of spate of popularization of the Holocaust, after years of a lot of people not thinking about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="824">ANSWER:  Well, usually historians are very critical, I’m not. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">I think “Schindler’s List” is quite a good film, and I think the historical data are mainly, I think, reliable. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">One can talk about some interpretations here, but in general I think it helped to understand the process in the minds of many youngsters in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And well, it doesn’t replace the historical work, which is certainly more abstract, and less simple, but on the other hand, I think it was more helpful than the documentary films we had in the -- in the 50’s and 60’s, which didn’t left an imprint on the German mentality, or at least not too much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="828">QUESTION:  Including Landsman’s “Shoah’’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="829">ANSWER:  Landsman’s “Shoah” is different, but you know, Landsman’s “Shoah” has something for a few intellectuals who will sit there for 24 hours, I don’t know how long that is, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">QUESTION:  Nine hours, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="831">ANSWER:  Nine hours, I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="832">QUESTION:  But still --
ANSWER:  You know, that’s not symptomatic for a -- for the public. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">It’s very impressive, you know, and [indecipherable].</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="834">QUESTION:  A-As an historian, is it an odd phenomenon that the farther one seems to get from this event, the more interest there seems to be, or is there deep -- how -- do you understand what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="835">I mean, they -- there may --
ANSWER:  I don’t understand it very well, you know, we have an interchannel change, and suddenly we have a generation which starts, and you -- well, it goes a whole way. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">We did, as historians, starting with the ideas, and turning back to issues they don’t know -- want to know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And it’s so forth they have, and -- and fairly increased interest in the second World War, and the Jewish issue, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Among the younger students today, and that’s quite a phenomenon, and -- but it has to be interpreted in terms of interchannel change. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Do you know, after those generations have left <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , or the positions who was -- who were in this or that kind involved, now the next generation wants to know, and to provide information and -- and that -- start anew, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="840">QUESTION:  So, 1s that connected with what you said in your Leo Beck lecture? </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Implicitly and explicitly, the legacy of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> forms the historical framework for the process of acquiring a new national self-concept?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="842">ANSWER:  Well, not necessarily, but that’s certainly connected to that, that we have that phenomenon in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which I think it’s really remarkable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="843">QUESTION:  So tell me what this means. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">Why is this so necessary for it -- for a new self national -- a n-national self-confidence?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="845">ANSWER:  You know we had a national indifference in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time, and the nation stayed traditional 19" century, almost disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">If you talk to the kids today about Bismarck, they don’t know who he is, you know, and if you talk about students in the war area, about the French scoo occupations, and they ask whether that’s in the 17" century, or in the [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">That’s got national history in a traditional sense, 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> has, in a way, faded out among the next generations. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And there 1s, I think, growing a new national identity, which looks more at the chain of events, starting in the Third Reich, leading to the second World War, and the Holocaust, and certainly then, being in the background for the formation of the [indecipherable] republic. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">That’s rit -- quite a different side of historical basic facts, which have -- they have in mind, and to which I think the experience of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> belongs, in a way, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="850">QUESTION:  Let me go back for a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">You’ve -- Was this the first time -- I know it’s not the first time you’ve been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , but the first time you saw the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> this year?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="854">QUESTION:  So, how do you evaluate, as you walk through the permanent exhibition, it’s portrayal of this history?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="855">ANSWER:  Well, [indecipherable] books on that, d’you ever read them? </span><span class="sentence" id="856">You know, and I found it very interesting, the -- the recent book by Ted Hurwitz his name, on the -- on the miterzation of the Holocaust, you know, and he brings that interpretation that they want to put a positive meaning by stressing the Americans as liberators, and so on, in comparison to what is going on 1n wa -- Yad Vashem, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">Well, from a German viewpoint, that is -- that’s not very convincing. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And I -- I always told that story that a Germans wanted to have a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for the resistance movement, but unfortunately that is too anti-Semitic [indecipherable] to wage that -- at --idea, you know, but that was very symptomatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">But we don’t have the possibility to connect the -- that, even to bend with some sort of suppositive national tradition, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">That’s it’s -- has to do with what I told you about, the emergence of a new consciousness. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">We just can’t [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">At least the other <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> resistance no -- we have done five people, or 50, that’s not enough, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">It’s not representative. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And then so far, sh -- from a German viewpoint, you look at that as certainly a bit skeptically with all the politish and nutson went on the attendance to -- to have some general consequential slogans, or what do you say, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">We are far more skeptical as -- us Germans who went through that experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">But anyhow, it’s a very impressive exhibition, and is a -- is a very, very good and interesting material, 1n many respects, but it would be [indecipherable] to say that a most impressive <span class="NPIP">place</span> is where you have the pictures of that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , what’s the name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="867">QUESTION:  Rushishaka
ANSWER:  You know, that is --
QUESTION:  [indecipherable] yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="868">ANSWER:  But that would be also the reaction of the -- of the German yosterday, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Because that’s like “Schindler’s List’, or that’s the Klemperer diary. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">It shows the people again, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And what is our task as historians, is to -- not to -- well, the people should stay alive in the whole description of the process, that’s difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And that is done, 1n a way, by the exhibition.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="873">QUESTION:  So then you must appreciate what Saul Freidlander is trying to do in his --
ANSWER:  Well I -- He is a good friend of mine, I like him. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">The book is wonderful in respect -- with respect to the style and the language and the -- I think the breadth of the material he uses. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I differ in one respect, that I think that he doesn’t show the political process leading to the events, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">That -- I want to write now a small history of the Holocaust, and I am not so bright as my friend Saul [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Wh-What I want to show is how -- why the Nuremberg laws were in 1935, and not in 1943, or so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">And how did the rise kastern, cris - Crystal night occur in Sep-September 19 -- no, in November 1938, and -- d’you know, that he doesn’t show, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">What are the -- the political mechanisms which were involved, and that is a little bit what I think I can contribute to the business of all these experts who -- that’s very impressive, but we have to -- to -- also to explain why that came into being, you know, and that’s -- that’s difficult and -- and so far, it’s wonderful, but -- but it’s written from hindsight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="880">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="881">ANSWER:  But one should try --
QUESTION:  To understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="882">ANSWER:  -- to write in the way that you still, as a reader, are not aware what 1s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">Later on ows, that’s still open -- open -- open -- open. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And suddenly then, it will change. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">That’s what I want to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Whether I’Il be able is another question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="887">QUESTION:  Have you started it?</span></p>
