<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Samuel Makower, born Smuel Makower. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">This is a [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I was born January the sixth, 1922 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shasnich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">This is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , north of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , near the <span class="DLF">Prussian border</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Tell me a little bit about your life before the war, your family, your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was a little, typical <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetl</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">The -- although the majority of the people were Poles, and there were about eight to 9,000 population, and about -- over two thou -- 2500 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">The -- I was born to a family le -- relatively large family, we were nine children, and my father was a business man. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Went -- finish <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , and after that I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> which was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubuc</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> about 20 miles away from a -- from our -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shasnich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And I was here a student till the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">The war started, I still remember, Friday, 1939, and we heard immediately the thundering of the cannons. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And all Jews left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> next day, Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Went south, to relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I need to stop you here, because I still want to know a little bit more about your -- your life before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">You mentioned that there was a -- for the population there was a f -- a fairly substantial Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Was -- was it integrated into the Polish community, or were most of your contacts Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  Most of the contacts were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">As a matter of fact, I did not practically know any Polish people, except neighbors who were close by. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">But to plays, I used to play with the Jewish children, and one started life a -- in -- as a child in goldstu, in elderidge, and Haider, and then -- and <span class="BUILDING">school</span> started in the morning, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and after that you go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> all day long, all the years. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And when there was no Haider, because I was relatively good student, and I passed fast everything, then I wa -- I was invited by people to -- to read Talmud, to learn more with them in -- without charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">They wanted me because I was a good student, so they wanted with their son -- that I learn with -- with their son. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So, till the evening -- the evening th -- I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , made the lessons, went to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Next day the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  Was there any anti-Semitism in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  Not that -- there was anti-Semitism, no -- no doubt about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Th-the Haider where I went to was near the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , so whenever it was some kind of a holiday, we were the killer of God. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And -- especially on certain holidays when I had to go around the long way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because there was a procession, and in -- in the short way, and I knew that I will be beaten up if I’ll go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So there was no -- no doubt. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">But often fights between Jewish children, and -- and Polish children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  The Jewish community wa -- did you -- do you remember having a sort of active cultural life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Oh yes, there was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish library</span> , and all kind of Zionist lectures, and -- and we went -- we were exposed as young children already, to go, everybody want to -- hey, we’ll go -- we'll try to go to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And when I chose to go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> , they definitely -- it was -- 1t was a Zionist no -- s -- a-admira -- at-atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And learning Hebrew, and Jewish history, a-and ne -- I een -- Hebrew language, and I -- I was supposed to read every week a book in Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">One in Hebrew -- I mean, one in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So -- but it was a Jewish culture, definitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  And you were part of some of these youth organizations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  I started to go to a Hashamiratzaire, for various reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">One is this is the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> where -- where I -- we could play ping pong, and this kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">As children we were- we were -- this was influential, playing together, and -- but in -- dreaming one day to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And in the matter of fact, my f -- my sister went, before the war to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Before the war started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Of course, part of the reason I ask this is that you later on, and -- were very active with the partisans, and I just wondered if -- if any of this came from kind of your life, or your ideology before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">This was a -- in the partisan 1t was simply because a -- as a way of -- to survive, and to take reveng -- revenge.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">We’ll get to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I’m just trying to establish what your -- your life was like before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">How much did you know about what was already going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And Hitler?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  We knew that there was a ge -- there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> , and something was going on it’s bad for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">But we did not know much. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Cause -- because later we knew what was going on till °39, because there were Jew -- papers, so we -- so we knew that Hitler is anti-Semite- Semitic, and there are certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , but at that time, nobody spoke about mass destruction somewhere, or -- or -- or killings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  And you probably didn’t think that that would affect you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  No, till -- till the -- when the war started, yes, we wonder -- this is why when -- I try to go toward -- toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> when the war started, because I thought I -- maybe there will be a fight, and I'll not be on the side with the Germans, but I'll be in the -- where the pol - Polish are, and -- but unfortunately on their way, the Germans went faster toward -- came faster toward -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , to -- practically to -- see, they didn’t take <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , but close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , so that I was under the Germans, and -- and decided to go back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">When I came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , was about a few days, the commander of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , a ger -- the German, told all Jews to come out one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">It was about the 15" abou -- of -- of -- of September, and put all the Jews in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and took them out towards the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Left us in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the Polish army used to exercise. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">The next morning they came again, and told us to walk toward the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And we walked over there, and they took away everything what we ha -- what we still had, if they saw anything valuable. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Like, my father forgot to hide his golden watch what he had from his father, they took it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And I still remember to -- today the first Russian soldier we saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And while the German were talking to us in such a derogative way, he was so nice, and said something, and I didn’t understand a word what he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">My father understood Russian because as a child, Shasnich was under the Russian, and he learned Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">So he said, “Oh, he told us to go over there, where there is soup for us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Alright, we went there -- the Jewish population of this small <span class="NPIP">place</span> me -- pr-prepare soup -- soup for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">For we a-ate something warm, and after that they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Couple questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">First, I’m sort of curious why the Germans pushed you toward <span class="REGION">Russian territory</span> rather than just taking care of you themselves, and the other thing I want you talk a little bit about is kind of the general kind of mood, what it -- what this all felt like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  As a whole, we were scared all the time, because we did not -- we knew that they hate Jews, as a fer -- a matter of fact, they -- this 1s why they took all the Jews and send them out, because they said that our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> will be incorporated in the -- in the Reich, and they did not want to have Jews, the addition of Jews in the -- in the Reich, so they sa -- told us to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And from the Russian point of view it was very nice [indecipherable] let us come in, as a matter of fact, for approximately two months, it -- <span class="DLF">borders</span> were opening, everybody who came, who could -- who took advantage, and cou -- and came, survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">More Polish Jews survived after that in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> than in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">The mood was of unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We don’t know what expects us. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We know that after that -- after [indecipherable] already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> that we are free to do various things, that nobody persecute us as Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">If there is something, a lack of certain things, because we saw how eagerly the j -- Russian soldiers is buying various things on the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="78">indecipherable] So it is because everybody -- or nobody has enough, but not because we were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So from this point of view I felt a -- it was good and we thanked th-the -- th-the German officer did not like to have Jews in hi -- in [indecipherable] in the -- in th-the matter of fact, in comparison 1s all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shasnich</span> , more Jews survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shasnich</span> than all the -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> around it, because they were completely destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  Were you with your f -- were you with your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Who was with you at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  At this -- at that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we were -- had part of the family, two -- I -- one -- my youngest brother and sister stayed with -- with aunts in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , because it was near where they stayed when my -- when my -- our family left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shasnich</span> the next day after the war, they stayed there because we did not know what will happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I went with my older brother, further, and we came back, so we were -- and my -- my older sister, Anya, she was -- She worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was taken, she came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shasnich</span> , and she was told that all the Jews were send away, so she didn’t know where to go, she went to the -- my aunt in -- 1 -- where my brother -- younger brother and sister were. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And they -- she organized here a group of people she knew, and they all went also to the rush - toward the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">She asked my aunt and cousins to go with them, and they said no, they are business people, what do they do in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="87">They didn’t know -- they were afraid of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And nobody survived, them. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And my sister came -- as a matter of fact, I wanted to go back to bring my sister, and my father told me, “No, I don’t have -- I’m missing two daughters and -- and -- and a -- and a son, I don’t want to be -- to miss another son.” </span><span class="sentence" id="90">He didn’t let me. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So every day I was going in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , waiting, watching, maybe my sister will come. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And sure enough one day I saw a group and she was here, this is my younger sister, and she -- she came. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> in a -- in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , four or five families. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Everybody had a corner, and sleeping on the -- on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , so many people were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , because the city of say like 100,000 had a -- had about 150,000 foreigners [indecipherable] who came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">There was no old <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , or- <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were taken up by people as -- we slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And one day there were -- came also a couple of guys, and it was my brother-in-law, and they started to like each other, my sister and my -- and my future brother-in-law, who came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , also, to -- told -- went over to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And we signed up -- there were always so-called -- we called them byersgame, and they were looking for people to work somewhere deep in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and they were taking the people there to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">We said, we have nothing to lose, we don’t have what -- we will sign up -- we didn’t know where to -- and we signed up to go to work in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">They took us to a <span class="BUILDING">construction place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We drove for about a week on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , deep into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ural mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We came there, it was middle -- 1t was October, and I remember it was such a storm that from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> to go down, was about 500 <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We were running, and most of the people ended up this short pla -- walk, or run, to have frozen nose, frozen ears, because it was minus 40 something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  Let me stop you for a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And that was all organized for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">How long were you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> , and what -- was there any normalcy to life there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  Well we getting soup here, soup there, and the question was how to survive, and everything -- by trying to get something. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Jewish -- the Je -- Jewish population organized help for the various people who came from all over <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And I don’t know if I -- exactly how the organization worked, but from our point of view they we -- we were relying on getting somewhere, something to eat, in order to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So we were looking for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to -- to go to live permanently. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Here and there, you heard, people did go into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and they came back, because they say oh, it is such a poor life the -- there 1s -- the people don’t had no -- you don’t have <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> open where you can buy things, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And as a matter of fact, there were some people who decided maybe they’ Il go back to the German -- to where the German 1s -- to the Jew -- <span class="BUILDING">home</span> [inaudible]. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And after that, Stalin use all these lists of people who s -- wanted to go back, and send them all to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And thanks to that, they survived, because the local population up there were -- was killed in ’40 -- °41 - 42.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  Your treatm -- your treatment by the Russian authorities, or the Soviet authorities in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> was --
ANSWER:  Oh, it was good, but they did not -- they probably supplied the food for the various organization to feed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">But on the whole, what I saw later, that <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> suffered from a lack of food, in spite of the fact they ha -- they had <span class="COUNTRY">Ukrainia</span> , which ha -- ga -- which has the -- had the best <span class="REGION">land</span> in -- in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So -- but this was -- I have ler -- later learned, was the illness of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , the -- the collectives. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Cohoss what they called, they did not produce enough food. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So the attitude was good, but they did not have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  So, you stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> for how long?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  For about two months, or three months maximally, and -- but -- because late of the year, toward the end of the year, we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rockitienka</span> , a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ural Mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">We were all supposed to work on the construction. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">This was a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they build -- they were supposed to be build <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> for miners, because they had a <span class="DLF">copper mine</span> , and also the copper had a certain percentage of gold, so gold and copper was being taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And Jewish people came, and we were taught to build, and we worked 1n this <span class="REGION">region</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Since I was below 18, so I did not have to work eight hours a day, but just six hours a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And one day a week we had free, so the -- in the winter they volunteered me always to shovel snow, because there was plenty of snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">In the winter the temperature was unbelievably cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I cr -- I did not e-expect -- I didn’t hear about such cold, and we were work -- working on construction till minus 40 degrees. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">When there was minus 41, we could stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And we were supposed to work for one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And this is what happened for one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">We worked there, and after that, they said you are free to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  I want to know a little bit more about the life there. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Was -- was your family with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Who -- who went with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Did you -- were you able to sort of keep up some of your traditions? </span><span class="sentence" id="138">What was the life like?</span></p>

brother-in-law they had -- in the meantime had a little girl, and they decided to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">My brother-in-law was getting letters from friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And they said in the Polish part of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> , they were there, in charge, because they were Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And they said, “Come back, and you’|l have -- you'll be alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Come in.” </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">They came to the <span class="DLF">border</span> , the former bor -- the former <span class="DLF">border</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and they -- and they did not let them go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So they came -- they came -- it was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , they went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , I -- we knew somebody, and the story was, when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rakichenka</span> , I learned fast to -- the language, to read and write Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And one day a young man came to me, “Sam, write me a letter in Russian.” </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And he told me in Polish what to write, “Dear uncle, I am the son of your brother,” so and so. “</span><span class="sentence" id="169">We received from your letters till 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">In 1936, we stopped getting any letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">If you are alive, please write to me, I am here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rakichenka</span> , and I am here working till -- I am supposed to work till the end of 19 -- till 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And please write.” </span><span class="sentence" id="173">After a short time he got a answer, and it came back to me, say -- the letter was written by his cousin. “</span><span class="sentence" id="174">Your uncle passed away, but I live in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ,” and it said, “When you will free -- be free, come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , my husband is a officer in the Red army, he’ll arrange for you to be able to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And indeed, when our contract finished, he left for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , and he kept -- he wrote us letters on a -- wrote them because we were -- thanks to me he got -- went there. “</span><span class="sentence" id="176">Oh,” they say, “you can go in <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , they are -- you can get jobs here, and your -- and there is a different life.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Temperature definitely no comparison. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">There is no such a temperature like it was in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , close to. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">No in -- because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rakichenka</span> , we were about 10 days a year without wind. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Winter was a cold wind blowing, in summer a hot wind blowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Summer you -- you slept in the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , because it was too hot to sleep in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and winter was too cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">So my sister and brother-in-law went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> and -- and this officer arranged for them a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay, and a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Because in a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> at that time, you could get a job if you had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , if you had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And you could get a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live if you had a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">So it was a circle, so that people from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> will not be able to get into the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , because in the large -- large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> , and so on, there were -- it was another type of living than in the -- than in the small <span class="NPIP">places</span> where we were in -- deep in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So they got their <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, and they wrote a -- now it was my turn to come, because I wanted to start -- to continue to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And in the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian cities</span> , you could work at day and study in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">You couldn’t where we were in a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> , in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rakichenka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">We didn’t have money for the whole family to leave, and when we -- we sold what -- what excess of -- we had, in order to -- so that I could buy a ticket for me, and I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And I managed to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , there were three weeks before the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Before June. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So in June I went -- I came to -- to -- beginning of June to -- I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">The 22™ of June, the -- the -- the Germans attacked, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> was bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">We tried to go back toward -- after few days we tried to go back toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> , but the Germans were in front of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">They came from the north. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">They took <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Smollensk</span> before they took <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">So we -- we ha -- had to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And after a month, they told the Jews to come to form the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So I -- yeah, I believe in July or in August, they formed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , life was -- we try -- we found a -- a -- a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , an unfinished <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So we in the one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , my brother-in-law, sister, the child, and me -- and myself, so we are in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Again it started. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">The Germans were giving us -- giving us two pound of bread per person and that was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So the people, in order to survive were selling various things, whatever they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">In <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , people were assembling, everybody -- whatever was in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , they were buying. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I remember there was a saying when you went somewhere you saw suddenly a <span class="DLF">line</span> , so th-the question was, what do they give? </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Once I asked, ““Why do they say, what do they give? </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Why don’t they say what do they sell?” </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So one was standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> said, “If you buy it here, it is like you got it,” because after that you can sell it for two or three times the price. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So everybody was assem -- whatever they could buy, and everybody had so and so many yards of material. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And so, as a whole, ke -- to keep it whole, a supply, not to wait when you need a pair of pants to buy a pair of pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And this was a time when everybody was selling what they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Peasants were coming from around the <span class="REGION">area</span> , and the <span class="DLF">border</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was always a -- an exchange. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">We were living on this -- we were -- in the middle people were coming a -- we have a woman was coming, she has a suit she wants to change for potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">We -- my brother-in-law was [indecipherable] he used to go over to the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">We always had -- had -- we could snap the -- the wire, there were wires around, and -- and g -- and go over, and -- and since he, as a whole looked like what they call a -- looked like a po -- a Pole, and so he was going out and there getting more than on the -- on the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">You know, he used to come and take it in, and I was standing, watching, and there 1s a policeman nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And giving him signs he has to come, or not to -- not to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And this way we were -- we were getting there a little more than what you could get a-at a <span class="DLF">border</span> , so we were in the middle mi -- in this way -- from this way we lived, we -- we got a certain amount of food from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">QUESTION:  Was there a risk?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  Oh yes, there was a risk, because there were a lot of people killed, I mean, but my brother-in-law even -- when -- later when the slats went even into -- into -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">He went out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> 10 - 20 miles, and there exchange it, and bring it back, were two guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I went a few times, but since I wear glasses, they immediately recognized me as a Jew, and -- because Russians usually don’t wear glasses. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So I used to walk without glasses, and without glasses I don’t see anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So I couldn’t go too much -- too often. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Once or twice I went -- once or twi -- a number of times I went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">There was one family was working the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they were making vodka. [</span><span class="sentence" id="228">indecipherable] but he used to bring us so and so many bottles vodka, and we had a steady guy who was giving us food, either flour, or various kind of -- various kind of other -- other food for the -- for the vodka. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">We were a Steady supplier, and we were giving them, and a little bit leaving over for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And once I remember I went over and a policeman caught me, with a ra -- another guy and I -- and I was thinking a -- I was looking for a stone to hit him, because I -- you know, I will not go into the -- into the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> , because if somebody was taken to the police, he never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">But he went with me, he saw where I came from, and he saw there the bottle vodka was still on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , what I left, and there -- and they took me out into the - took me back to the <span class="DLF">border</span> and said, don’t -- to the -- go -- go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , don’t ever come back, and that was strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And after that, the guy with who [indecipherable] I saw him in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And I thought that it was two policemen. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I said, ““What are you doing?” </span><span class="sentence" id="235">He said, “I am a -- I am a Jewish guy, and I was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and this policeman caught me. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And then we saw you, walking with a bottle of vodka. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So we went to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and I paid for the vodka so that he can take the vodka, and he let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And he let you go, too.” </span><span class="sentence" id="239">So this was anything, this is how we were trying to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">It was no problem to go out, because we always -- we’re -- we’re walking around with something to cut the wires, 1n order to be able to pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">But the question, well what you do after that? </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Everybody was -- most of the people were scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">There was one family to -- I used to go there to ask them for a piece of bread to bring to my sister, or -- and after that he begged me not to come, because he didn’t open the <span class="DLF">door</span> , because he said the neighbors know, they noticed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Because they were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">They did not want to be killed just because I came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So we were going -- we were taken to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">At work we were getting -- men were ge -- getting some food at work. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And there I was always either begging, if it was a -a-- if I -- if I cleaned the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> of soldiers, begging them if they have a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">A good -- a good German was giving me a piece of bread, or something else to eat, and if he was bad, he gave me a kick. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">So if it was outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , I was -- there were always something growing, so we’re stealing a few -- a few carrots, or a few potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And if the- in the worse case, when they didn -- when I didn’t have what to take, so I was taking even the clippings from potatoes from the -- from where we worked, for it was -- my sister used to wash the clipping, and make -- make from this potato latkes. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And this is on what they lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Since the war -- the war -- the wa -- there was one guy who we always were ascared of, and his name was Gorajetski. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">He was a -- he had written on the -- belina politsi was written. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">He spoke Russian and German, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And he could not eat breakfast without killing a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And once we -- he got us, and we worked for him, my brother-in-law and myself, and we said never again. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And this was not work, it was just making fun of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Trying to catch -- to carry -- and running and beating us while we were carrying it from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and then another group was taking it further, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">This was fun for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">So -- and after that, he organized like a -- a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">The people could not come from [indecipherable] <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">They were there with a group of Ukrainians were guarding it, and these people could not come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they were sleeping over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">So whenever we saw him we did not go to work, because normally people -- other workers were coming, looking for people to work, taking to work, doing either construction work, or cleaning, or whatever, and in the evening coming back at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">This we wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">In order to avoid, since they were looking for work -- were looking for workers each time, and looking for people to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> -- it was on <span class="DLF">Schirrocca Street</span> , I remember, we -- in order to be able to hide, we built a <span class="DLF">double wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">A very -- we moved the <span class="DLF">wall</span> in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , made it a little narrower. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Since we worked in construction, I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">neighbors room</span> and covered it, a -- because otherwise we could -- you could see through. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And in our <span class="NPIP">place</span> was just wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">So we could open, go in, hide, and -- and talk to neighbors, they realized, hey, whenever they’re looking for -- for men, you are running <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Where do you hide in the- in there? </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And then they saw the -- the Ukrainians are going in and coming out empty, no wa -- nobody -- they don’t catch you. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">They looked -- they told us, they look for where we’re hiding, and they didn’t no -- they didn’t no -- notice that we had build this -- this <span class="DLF">double wall</span> to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Other people were hiding behind -- under the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> -- the fir -- floor, there was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to crawl in, and they were hiding there. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So this was as long as they were looking just for men, and once we saw e -- they were taking whole families. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Since we lived all in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the <span class="DLF">street</span> was a free, for Aryan, not for Jews, on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , on this side was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And so we saw they were -- they take -- they took whole families, a few thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And taking them out and then they never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And they shortened the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they made the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So we start to think, what do we do for -- if -- if they come here? </span><span class="sentence" id="281">In addition to wait, we started to hear that they have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span> where they put in people, and put the gas in -- in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobile</span> , and they gas the people in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So whenever we heard -- heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> coming, we started to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">What to do with the -- your little girl, the little girl that we too -- took her in between the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , was crying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So we cided -- decided to build something on the first of this -- we lived on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">On the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , there was one part which was not finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">In one of the not finished <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , they build a deep, in the ground, we put wa- tube, so to -- so they’ll get air, and there we saw, when the little girl was crying, <span class="NPIP">outside</span> you didn’t hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So the next time there was a thing where we had to hide, I was taking my brother-in-law, sister, and the child to this, lay down, and I was covering it with sand. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Sand made it even so that you don’t see that anything is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Then I was going up and hiding in the -- between the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And this way how we were all kind of -- we Call it pogroms, we survived the pogroms in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">QUESTION:  Talk a little bit about these pograms, what you saw, what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">ANSWER:  Mostly it was the -- the killers were Ukrainians. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">They were -- they surrounded a -- a -- an <span class="REGION">area</span> , took the Jews out, into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">In most of the cases, we knew that there will be a pogrom, because there are people who worked for the ge -- for the -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and they heard a -- a group sondercommander came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And when a sondercommander came in, means something will be happening -- will be happening in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And indeed, they used to use Ukrainians or Latvians, and encircle a certain <span class="REGION">area</span> , one <span class="DLF">street</span> , or two <span class="DLF">street</span> , take all the people out in the morning, and lead them out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">In most of the cases, we saw them through this way, between the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , wik -- which was a -- a passage from north to south. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">So we su -- sometime when we looked, we saw hey, they are taking out a group of people, a number of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And once they have circled also, the people from the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and they emptied there. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">So I thought they’ Il make the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And they -- instead of this, they brought German Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , they brought there, and they were there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">QUESTION:  In the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">ANSWER:  In the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">So, to go over there wit -- there was one <span class="NPIP">place</span> near the Judenrat, where there was a <span class="DLF">door</span> -- a <span class="DLF">door</span> to go across the <span class="DLF">street</span> and go to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">In the middle we were not allowed because we had to wear a -- what -- we would -- we did not have a Star of David like Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had, but a round yellow -- yellow -- a y- yellow circle. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">In the beginning I used not -- not to wear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">But then -- and I heard that several people were caught and they were shot because they did not have the yellow sign, so I started to wear the yellow sign here. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">If I wanted to go into the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> , I covered it, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> I was going like this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">QUESTION:  Did you see -- did you feel safe walking on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1093">ANSWER:  Oh, both. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">Mostly it was because to manipulate was better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">In some <span class="NPIP">places</span> it was better to be younger, let’s say, cause then you’ll be able -- in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> was better to be older, then there -- then you can do in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">These things still remained, and I -- as I said, this was automatic with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">I had to fight to -- to a -- you can tell the truth, there -- they -- there is no danger any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">Because still I was thinking there is a danger in -- in -- lurking somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">And I had to fight this myself to answer the truth, to tell the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">To forget about it.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Do you feel safe now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1118">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">Now this went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">But took me -- it took me time to -- to overcome it, because I was recognizing myself, hey, there is no danger Sam, any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">You -- and I talking to myself, and I say, so the war is over, the war 1s over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1122">QUESTION:  Do you think that -- that your experiences affected the way you raised your children, or --
ANSWER:  Not that I think now about it, although I -- I worried often about the safety, not saying anything maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">But maybe I was overcautious in various <span class="REGION">area</span> , I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">But it definitely -- I wa -- I was 1 -- always think, hey is this -- is it safe, can they go somewhere on a -- to acamp? </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">Who will -- 1s it safe to be in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">I had to think it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">I di -- I didn’t talk about it, but I was thinking to myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1129">QUESTION:  What were some of the other difficulties in kind of adjusting to a new life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1130">ANSWER:  I cannot think, because I had all the time -- had to adjust each time, to adjust to a different language, or to -- because in the beginning everything was -- let’s say I was raised in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , Polish, and after that to adjust everything in Russian, then I was adjusting back to Polish, then to German, and after that were ex -- exa -- to -- to -- to English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">And -- so it was adjusting was constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">I was doing it all the time, till here I thought I am now -- I am here, I am an -- an American now.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1140">QUESTION:  Are you -- are you religious now, or have -- di-did you raise your children Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1141">ANSWER:  Yes, we belong to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and -- and actually it was -- in the beginning I could not go to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">In -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , let’s say whenever there was a Jewish holiday, I did not go to -- to -- simply to show a -- I am Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">And I used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , but I was always <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , not going in -- in to -- to pray, because I understood Hebrew -- I understand Hebrew, I learned Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">And whenever there was written, God is full of mercy, I could not see where -- where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">I saw th -- the -- that children, and that -- that people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">So, I could not pray for a long, long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">But after that, here, when I thought, yeah, if I will not go to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and my wife wanted the children to be raised [indecipherable], if not, then they will become -- they’II stop being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">So I agreed yes, we’ll go to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and we belonged to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> since then, and we tried to raise our children Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1149">QUESTION:  Is this important?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1150">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">Yes, because this is a way how e -- how they can stay Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> you could be Jewish without being religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">In <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> you can be Jewish without being religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">But in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , if you don’t belong to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and you don’t na -- then you stop being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">So this is important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1156">QUESTION:  What do you think gave you, sort of the courage, and the strength to get through all of this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1157">ANSWER:  In the beginning it was a will to survive, so see again my -- my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">To see my brothers and sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">At a certain time it was -- a certain amount was a desire to re -- of revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">And not only it was expected to me -- from me, I remember in the Red army, when we entered the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German village</span> , and there were only a couple of old people remained in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , how everybody else ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">And the soldiers come me, “Sam, there are the -- they are still Germans, we should go kill them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">And I asked them, [indecipherable] I say, should I? </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">I told them, “Why should I kill them? </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">They didn’t do anything bad to me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">They says, “You are Jewish, didn’t they kill all Jews?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">And I told them, “So, what do you want me to be like the -- like the German SS, do the same thing?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">Within myself I saw a -- I cannot do what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">So I had opportunity to kill Germans, but I couldn’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">But there was a certain -- during the war, there was a certain amount of desire for revenge.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1170">QUESTION:  Was there anything in your upbringing that kind of gave you the s -- the strength you needed to -- to get through this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">Were there things that you thought about while you were fighting, or that you dreamed about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1172">ANSWER:  No, I would not say this, because my father always wanted me to be kind, and -- and -- and -- and -- and understandable of other people need. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">No, I would not say that upbringing did it, it is the experience during the war which made me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">It is only -- 1t was one thing that I -- when I was as a partisan walking through the -- at night sometimes, somewhere through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and I thought, hey, why did -- how come -- why -- why did not -- I not have a rifle when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">I would have felt differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">That it will cost somebody s-something to kill me, that they cannot kill just people for -- for nothing, and without paying any -- a price for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">So this -- and this is sometimes left -- sometimes when I think about people here having so mu -- so mu -- rifles, and they causing here death, I still sometimes think a -- but if Jews had rifles during -- in 1939, many more Germans would have paid with their life, or Ukrainians for -- for killing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">So it’s -- it affects today my thinking that I am not so against -- so much against the National Rifle Organization as may be if I would have not had my experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1179">QUESTION:  What else did you think about while you were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1180">ANSWER:  Oh, if I was thinking, I -- 1t was a dream that I -- that I will one day be sitting here in -- and answer question and tell stories about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">I never believed that such a day will come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">I thought I am destined to be killed, but I want to pay a price -- that they pay a price for killing me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">But I didn’t believe that Pll survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1184">QUESTION:  Did you think about your family when you were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , or --
ANSWER:  Oh, always. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">They were always close and I was thanking God that we did not have my -- money -- enough money so the whole family will go to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , otherwise I would have not been able to -- to run away and then -- and this is what happened to a lot of young people who stayed, did not go away because they could not leave their mothers or- or fathers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">Because very often, they were supplying the food, you know, for the -- temporarily to s -- to survive, even -- even when a lot of people were hungry, but still the young people were those who were helping them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">And a lot of them could not go away and leave their parents, or brothers and sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">So I thank God that -- that it -- that only -- that only I was the one who went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , and they stayed far back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1189">QUESTION:  Are there certain, or were there, I guess, certain things that happened to you here that would evoke certain memories, whether it was a smell, or a sound, or something someone said that all of a sudden would make you think back to these difficult experiences? </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">Certain things that just bring out these memories?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1191">ANSWER:  Not particularly, except a few days ago, I was to a meeting where a professor from <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> gave a -- a speech at <span class="BUILDING">Gratts College</span> in -- in -- it’s a Jewish college in -- in <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">And he spoke that they wanted to -- to learn about Jews, and Jewish culture, and so on, because Jews have influence everywhere about -- 1n -- in -- in money and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">And -- and a -- in business and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">And I thought, hey, where did I hear that Jews have all these influence, worldwide influence? </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">It was in the shtillmer where I read it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">So these kind of thing I wanted to ask, but then --
QUESTION:  And maybe he was just being complimentary?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1197">ANSWER:  Yes, that they want to get acquainted with Jewish culture, and so on, so [indecipherable], and he gave this as a reason, but there was [indecipherable] yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">Jews could not help effect t-to -- to bomb <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , or -- or -- or other things li-like this, and -- or -- or influence the British to let Patria, and -- and -- and what is the name, the -- the two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> which were blown up after that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">People tried to escape, and come to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">They didn’t have the influence at that time, but now, suddenly they have the influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1201">QUESTION:  What else? </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">Is there anything that you -- that you want to add? </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">I have a good question for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">Did -- did working with all of those -- those <span class="DLF">mines</span> , make you -- make you a better chemist?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1205">ANSWER:  No, I -- but I understood after that what I -- actually I did not want to be a -- as a young man, I did not want to be a chemist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">As a young man, I loved math, and I wanted to be a mathematician. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">In <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> whenever -- every -- we had a free lessons, I used to go to my math professor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">They -- all the kids were go -- were -- went out to play basketball, and I told him, hey, we have a free time, can you give my -- give me a math problem and- to solve? </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">And I hoped one day to be a mathematician. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">But when I started -- and applied to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , I said hey, if I’ll be a mathematician, what could it be? </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">At that time the only thing what I could be is a teacher, in all, I did not want to be a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">Because I was earning money in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> by tutoring other people, and I thought, no, I don’t want to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">So close to it, science, I said, hey, chemistry -- chemistry, I -- maybe I'll be able one day to work in <span class="BUILDING">Vitezma Institute</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">So this influenced my decision to choose it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">Yes, and after that I understood what I did during the war, how I blew up thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1216">QUESTION:  That early experience with explosives, and it doesn’t determine your future.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1217">ANSWER:  No, I became really not knowing much of chemistry especially is whenever it was needed- needed to blow up things and we didn’t have much TNT. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">I devised a method simply by taking -- putting together shells from -- from various -- various types of shells, and in between a small piece of TNT, and blowing up this TNT, and this TNT were causing all the shells to explode, and -- and take down the whole <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">This is -- this was my -- my invention, how -- how to do it.</span></p>
