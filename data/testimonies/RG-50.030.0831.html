ANSWER:  No, they were anxious and nervous because —
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  — they knew what — what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">But it was not until sometime late April of 1945, that a new event totally took me by surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">It was a night — in the middle of the night, I hear voices that I never heard before. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And I went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where we live, and there were — this is like four a.m. My parents were set — were seated, and my uncle and aunt were sitting right next to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And what had happened was that in 1940 — and during the October days, when everybody tried to get across to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , they were captured, along with a group of — of — of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">They were — they had been hiding in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> near the <span class="DLF">coast</span> , whereSeptember 18, 2015 they were hoping to get off to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And they were then taken down to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And they stayed there until April of °45, when they were rescued by, and taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> in those white <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> that [indecipherable] had arranged. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And so, at four a.m. I hear these voices, and I — I walk in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Th-Th-The — I knew them, but you know, at five before everything happened, we had visited them, so — and I certainly recognized them. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And they had survived without being able to function —

QUESTION:  So —
ANSWER:  — what — what we — to — to finish that story, what happened was that the war ended, and May fifth, <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> was freed, and — and open again. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And very shortly thereafter, we returned from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , to — to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And we found our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> pretty much exactly the way we had left it during those chaotic days, because a neighbor had taken care of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">September 18, 2015
QUESTION:  And can — can you tell us more about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I mean, do you know who that neighbor was? </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Do you remember that person from before the war, or —
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">It was a next door neighbor, and — but there were other people because I think the next door neighbor had — there was a death in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">An-Anyway, it — it was a — 1-1t — 1t — 1t was neighbors who took care of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And I think that my parents were totally, you know, astounded that this — and of course very happy, and — and — and so, in celebration, what they had brought back from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> was a certain kind of chocolate that during the — during the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , you know, you can’t get chocolate, so what happened was there was a big party, where all the kids in — in the — in the <span class="BUILDING">complex</span> where we lived, were invited up, and it — it was a sort of a — it — it was a party that took several days, that ended up — that ended our <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> odyssey.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  And when did you come to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , and how did that happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  That did not take place until ’63. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">What happened was, before that, in ni — in 1960, I star — as a young, you know, 22 year old kid, I went to wor — I — I started working f — at a <span class="BUILDING">movie company</span> aa — as a— you know, a P.A, a production assistant. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">One day, arrived a crew of five people from CBS in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">They came to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> in order to do a documentary about the rescue of the Danish Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And so I was attached — I— I spoke English, and I was attached to them as their sort of show — their — their guide. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And what happened was, we went around https://collections.ushmm.org September 18, 2015 and interviewed a number of the people who had been actively involved in the rescue operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And a-at some point, we sat in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elsinore</span> , which is on the coast, five miles across the water from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , at the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of a bookbinder, who — whose last name is Kerr(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And he spoke not a word of English, so I not only had to, you know, translate, but also sort of try to interpret what he was saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And that — it was fine, it went on for 20 minutes, and the CBS writer got all the information he wanted, until suddenly Mr. Kerr(ph) turned to me and said in Danish, listen, I’m — I’m — I’m busy, I’m a busy guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Get these damn Americans out, I’ve had enough of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Which was a — which made it slightly tricky for me to translate, and I didn’t quite know how to handle that. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But I wa — I was sort of saved by the bell, because in walk — into his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> walked another man and — and — who was Clearly a — his, you know, assistant, or friend, whatever, because he was then introduced to all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And when it came to me, and — and he heard my last name, he said, wait a minute, I — I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Then it turned out that wha — what unfolded was sort of a — a— wa-was as follows: it turned out that this man who came in, whose last name was Larsen(ph), had been the assistant of Kerr(ph) during the transportations, and what then ev — developed was that it was on Kerr’s(ph) <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that I had been taken across. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And he was the one who said, if you puke, you go overboard. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And so, all of this happened within two minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And h— September 18, 2015 and of course, Kerr(ph) changed his attitude, and we stayed and had beer and [indecipherable] and — and lunch, and stayed for hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And then the next day, that story was then made part of the — of — of the documentary. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And again, I was, because Kerr(ph) still didn’t speak a word of English, I had to sort of tran — translate everything he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">He then — his story, as part of — of — of the people rescuing, you know, their Danish neighbors, Danish Jewish neighbors, was that he continued sailing across, even into 1943 - ’44, the spring, in spite of the fact that it got increasingly difficult, because there were more and more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrols boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And so it was only on nights without any moon that — that he could cross without being seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And what did help his — his enterprise was that he went — he was sort of a—a Scarlet Pimpernel of — you know, he — he didn’t pay much attention to his own safety. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">He — he — he went from a very small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , to a f— pa — bigger <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and by the time, in November of °43, he had a — as, under the circumstance, a very fast <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And so, he managed to do this until he was caught and almost killed in 1944, and he spent a year in — in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">He also, obviously, survived, because we had this wonderful lunch and thing in — in — in [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  And — and — and so, did — did you talk at all about why he was motivated to do what he did?September 18, 2015
ANSWER:  Yes, we did, and his style was — he said — and I translated verbatim, and it ended up in the film, he said, I didn’t rescue the Jews, or anybody, because I liked them. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I did it because I hated the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">That was — I mean, that — that — that was what he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Obviously, there was more to it, but that was what came out of his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  Or he hated fascism, or he hated, you know —
ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  — the government, or whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Yeah, that’s — that’s — that’s very interesting, and — so, one question I had, just when reading your story was, when this documentary was made, was it because the Eichmann trial was going on, or was there any relationship to that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  No, I— I — that may have been part of — of the thing, but I think more to the point was that the producer of the CBS documentary, you know, had a personal interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">He thought this was a very important story to show his viewers, and it — it became — it was part of what was then the Sunday morning — CBS had Sunday morning — this before cable and anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And so the public affairs-type service that was given mostly by CBS — and NBC, and AB — ABC and NBC did not do the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So they had a whole department of — of people on fi — on 11", and <span class="DLF">57" Street</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">production office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And — and they did whatever they thought was important. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And September 18, 2015 so, they told this story because they wanted th-the American — the American viewers to see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And it was broadcast twice, because it did make — it was the first time a—a TV program had done this. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Books had been written that — before, and many ca-came afterwards, dealing with the same subject, so —
QUESTION:  And do you — do you know any other people who were rescued? </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I mean, 1s there any kind of community that you maintain because of, sort of that shared experience, or you’re just an American now, or —
ANSWER:  A few, but bi — because I have a very large family; my father is one of seven, my mother one of four, it was mo — it was more [phone ringing] I’m sorry about this — it was more —
QUESTION:  Oh, that’s okay. [</span><span class="sentence" id="101">break] Talk a little bit more about coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> —
ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  — and why and when, and how that whole thing — how it — how it all happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  Well, then, because of the contact that I made with the people at — at CBS, which lasted after they went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> , they worked on the program, and then I got a call, would I — would I like to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , because I could help sort of put it together, and then I — I stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I — I went back a couple times, but I ended up liking <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , I thought it was very exciting, and I — they gave me a job, sort of being a production manager for a number of programsSeptember 18, 2015 that came out of the same <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">The — the public affairs Sunday morning programs. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">There were two shows, “Lamp Unto My Feet,” and — and “Look up and Live.” </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Those were the two programs. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And this precedes you know, cable, and — and there — everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So, th — I—I got stuck here, and I met a young lady in 1964, and got married three — two and a half months after we met, and that is now 51 years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  And now you’re in <span class="REGION">California</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  And now — then we mo-moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L.A.</span> — from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L.A.</span> in 1990, because we made a movie there, and it was easier to — to sti — to then stay, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  So what — I mean, just — just to go back to what you remember from the time, what sticks with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="113">What is — I guess what — what do you really sort of have clear memories of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  I have a very clear memory of spending something like an hour on a fast moving <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , because what also happened was in October — in November of 1943, pretty much all the Jews had been crossed — ha-had crossed to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , and so those — th- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> then took care of — had people such as — on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> it wa — it was a — an RAF pilot who had parachuted over <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , and he had to get — be gotten out. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">The Royal Air Force, you know, the British air force. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And there were some other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So, later on, while I was still six or seven, and we talked about th-the — the https://collections.ushmm.org September 18, 2015 crossing, I — I wi— my father said something, and I said, well, it was me and the other saboteurs that — that crossed th-the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I — and because it was sort of a—a very — it was the first time I’d bid — bid — been on a — on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> of that type. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It may have been the first time I’d e-e — been on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">You know, as a five year — and a half year old boy, I was very excited about how it worked, and — and since, at that time, unlike before, during the really chaotic days in — in — in October, where s- sometimes young children were a— you know, given sleeping pills, or whatever, to make sure that they would not make noise, this was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And I guess th-the — Mr. Kerr(ph) took a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I guess he talked to me, and the way I responded made him believe that it was not necessary to — to, you know, give me an injection to — for — for me to keep quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So, by the time we arrived in — near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Helsingborg</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , which is across from the shortest distance from <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , I’ve — as we moved into the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> , along the — the side, I — I saw my father from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and he was there with — I think with a policeman, nervously pacing back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So that’s what I do remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  And — and do you remember getting off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and then seeing your father and being reunited, or —
ANSWER:  Well, th-the mi — the image I remember is, as we moved into — towards, you know, like maybe 25 yards before the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> actually moored. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And then what September 18, 2015 happened, I don’t remember, but obviously what — what did happen was that we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , my father and I, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> , where we reunited with my mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I— I— I— I just asked that question because I’m the mother of a couple of six year old boys, and I can’t imagine, you know, being that person who was waiting for your child to arrive, and —
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And one reason why, during the interview where I discover — where everybody discovered that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> had — actually had me on board, what actually happened was that the man who walked in with a severe limp, because he’d been injured during the war, where his fellow — Mr. Kerr(ph) was almost killed, when he was introduced to me, and remember the last name, which 1s somewhat unusual, there — the — the reason why he remembered that was that my father had, as a gift, made — given him a silver cigarette — he was a smoker — and had engraved in it, a thank you note from him, last name being Korzen. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So, the name had sort of se — was a name that this guy —
QUESTION:  Remembered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  — remembered very clearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  So — I don’t know how to end the interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Any — 1-is there anything else you would like to say, to tell us today?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  Well, the — https://collections.ushmm.org September 18, 2015
QUESTION:  I mean, what does your experience — how does that inform your day to day life today?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  What happened then, where basically people put themselves at — at risk, and — and many died, is an example that sort of stands as a, you know, role model for human behavior. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Now, what we’re witnessing these days, having to do with refugees, and — and immigration, and people trying to escape alive from either war, or related horrible — horrible to human situation, 1-1-1s — is the opposite. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And it would be very nice if this example, which is not really that known, could be, let’s say, elevated a-as the role model to — for everybody to — to — to imitate. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">How that 1s to be done, remains to be seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Obviously, it — it would take — 1t would take a — an attitude that is the total opposite of what’s happening right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">This is 19 — this is 2015, where, as we witness the debate about who we are, and what we should do, and what we should allow, the — the — the — as I see it, the idiocy of doing the opposite of what this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> 1s all based on. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">This <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is based on having people come here, and then start a life that ends up making a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as good as it can be, because of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So there — so therefore the — whenever the opposite is being advocated, that to me sounds like it’s based on idiocy, it’s based on ignorance, and anything we can do to counteract that, w-we — we all have, I think, a responsibility to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">September 18, 2015
QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Okay, can we cut for a minute, and let’s — [break] Can you tell me a little bit about what you remember from life before the Holocaust, you know, did — was your family religious? </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Did — did you go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , that kind of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  The answer is no. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">The previous germ — our gran — my grandparents, were somewhat religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They did not — they did celebrate the — the — the high holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I was Bar Mitzvahed when — 13, as the — as the last of my sibling, and so we were, and still are, what you would call secular Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">When our son turned 13, and we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> at that time, we did not — what we did was, we sent him to be tutored by a Yiddish poet, who tutored kids, and dealt with everything Jewish, except for religion: history, music, culture, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And so, he got his — his upbringing in the same secular tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">When my wife and I got — when I got married, which was in 1964, we went down to <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> in — in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , but we really didn’t like the <span class="INT_SPACE">AstroTurf floor</span> , and — and couldn’t see ourselves, sort of, doing the — the ceremony there. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So we ended up, we lived on the Upper West Side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> , and we ended up finding a rabbi in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , who was willing to marry us with the understanding that we were secular Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And so he — he promised to stay away from subject that had to do with — that would not really connect with being a secular Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And 1— and the only thing he — a-and — and he said, so let’s do it in my <span class="INT_SPACE">chambers</span> , you know, not in the — in the big <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , where September 18, 2015 actually, I think the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> seats about 3,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So, we came there with eight friends, and he changed his mind, he said no, let’s go into the big <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , even though we are only 12 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And so, you know, be-be-because he wanted to demonstrate that he could deliver a — a sermon for people like us, and — and he — and I — I’ve — he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So, he managed to stay away from, you know, the word God. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And yet, he — he did not violate his own, let’s say background and principles of being a rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">He — he knew how to do — to — to have that — that balance. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So my — the fact that I was — went through a Bar Mitzvah, I — I — I’m — I’m happy and proud of it, even though the truth is that very shortly thereafter, I lost the ability to s — to speak whatever Hebrew I had learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Which 1s what you need to understand, and — an-and you know, it’s like, it just ended up in — 1n — in retrospect it’s — it was a nice experience, it was a nice thing that happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  But it has not influenced our lives, going forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  Right, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And do you ha — do you feel a commonality with other Holocaust survivors, or do you feel, you know, that your experience was — because there — one thing we learn in this, you know, at the hol — at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , is that there are so many different experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">It is, you know, people say Holocaust survivor, but it is a very diverse sort of set of circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">https://collections.ushmm.org September 18, 2015
ANSWER:  It’s a very diverse — yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">One thing that happened very early on, after I settle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> was my wife and I, we met a— a young girl our age, and for reasons that neither of us understood, we sort of — we became fast friends, and still are. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">This is now 50 years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">She happened to be — she’s my age, and she was a — she 1s a survivor, but under much more dramatic osten — circumstances, in that she was saved by her grandmother, who was with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And this was — she — she was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and under circumstances that cannot be described any other than miraculous, survived, and ended up in sw — in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And by the time we met her in 1964 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , she had, like I, sort of gravitated from wherever, but — and had no longer — the fact that she was a German Jewish girl, had totally changed into, she was now a New Yorker. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">But — but her story, and her attitude, and her whole demeanor, clearly was something that, you know, it made an impression, and you know, th-the bond that — it’s not that my story has much to do with hers, because mine is a happy end, and hers is a bittersweet, with a happy end. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">So, it is a very big difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So I would like to thank you for coming, and doing this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">September 18, 2015
QUESTION:  And I — I think — am I missing anything? </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I said that already, but — so, can you tell me anything you remember about right before, and you know, were — what — was there anti-Semitism, do you remember feeling that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  No, growing up in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , as — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> as I did, the — the — the — the — the life that began after I came back in 1945, had — there was n-no anti-Semitism, or any other, let’s say negative aspect of — of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="182"><span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> was then a society that had very few prejudices. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">The Danish — the Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> , that had been there for a few hundred years, because in 16-something, the king of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> had invited a — a bunch of Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or wherever, in sort of <span class="REGION">middle Europe</span> , to settle, because he was an — an enterprising builder-type king, and he’d heard that having Jews around would be helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And so, from that moment on, the Jewish community grew, and by the time we get to World War II, there were, in Danish culture, a huge impact of the Jewish artists and playwrights, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">One play that is always part of the repertory of the <span class="BUILDING">Royal Theater</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> , is written by a Jew, and — and deals with a Jewish holiday, and the reason for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So, the au — so th-the — when I — un-until I left in 1964 and settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , the — th-the — being Jewish in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> was almost something that people would boast of, or having a Jewish grandmother, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Things have changed because there have been at — b-both because of politics, and so on, a-and September 18, 2015 because of Europe now is — 1s a different continent than it was then. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">So th-th-the wonderful — let’s say the — the days of peace and prosperity and cultural exuberance that I re-relate to, when I was very young, that has changed, unfortunately, in the negative direction.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  Yes, we go — we go quite often, at least once every two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">My very large family loves coming here. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And so, we s — th-they come here more often than we go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">But, you know, we are — you know, with everything, such as Skype and so on, we — we — we — we Stay in very close contact.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Well, thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I think we will end there.</span></p>
