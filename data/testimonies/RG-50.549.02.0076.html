<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Id first like to ask you to tell me about your early childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  The earliest that I remember of my childhood was the -- the rituals of the family that revolved around Jewish holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">The peak holiday was, of course, always Pesach, Passover, and it was big fuss, the dishes had to be changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">And lots of cooking took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I always ran errands for my mother, helping her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And I remember, perhaps as early as at the age of four or five, I learned how to pull the dough to make a streudel-thin dough. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">These are all trivial examples of what I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Tell me more about those family traditions and rituals, o-other observances, birthdays, religious holidays.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span> consisted of about 2,000 souls out of a population of about 19,000, so it was a very large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> was centered around the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which was a <span class="BUILDING">parochial school</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">The -- the -- so far as I can remember, my grandfather always took me to prayers on Saturday morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">There was regulated holidays that had to be kept, and my mother maintained originally, during the 30’s, before the trouble started, she maintained a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">It was a -- a Jewish religious procedure that didn’t make much sense to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">What particularly didn't make sense to me 1s that all the praying was done in ancient Hebrew, and I didn’t understand a word of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">They never tried to teach us what all of this mumbo-jumbo meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">As a matter of fact, my father, although he was one of the leading lights of the community, was known to be highly critical of the local rabbi for never speaking Slovak, or even German that people could understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">So there was this peculiar dichotomy, on the one hand of a very formal, ritualized religious experience and a gradual rebellion against the -- which was largely engendered by the time I was about seven, by my association with the local Zionist organization, co -- Hashomer Hatzair, which was a leftist organization, who was, at least mildly speaking, anti-religious, socialist, communalist, and totally rejecting the existence in the -- in the -- 1n the -- in the -- in the Slovak environment and totally focused on everybody getting out and moving to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and to live in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> in a communal Utopian environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And as time went on, this influence became stronger and stronger, because that was a community that made lots of sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">The songs were very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">The -- the s-singing in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was always wailing. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">The -- the -- the singing in the Hashomer Hatzair was very zippy. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Subsequently I found out that much of the communist singing was actually stolen from the Zionists, and -- but the songs were very strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I always said, years later, that the communists and the leftists always had the best songs and the ugliest girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">But the songs were great, and the entertainment was great, and there was a great deal of hiking, and -- and sort of rebellion organization - r-rebellions -- rebellious thinking against the environment that was closing in on us, already starting in °36.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  Now, you were only seven when you joined this organization, so obviously it was with your full family blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  Well, I wouldn’t say so. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">My grandfather, the religious grandfather highly disapproved of it, but my sister, Ella already was part of this religious and -- anti- religious attitude, and she had joined Hashomer Hatzair before me, so she sort of dragged me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And also, one of the teachers in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> was a -- a rebel. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">He turned out to be, subsequently, the editor of the Pravda newspaper, and of course, they shot him afterwards in the anti -- anti-Communist purges. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">But -- so there was a very lively environment going on, a tremendous amount of change, and a great deal of debates about the future and ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So I was exposed to ideas like that very early in my childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  Hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">How much older than you was Ella? </span><span class="sentence" id="33">What -- when would she have been born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  My sister Ella was born in 1925, so she was four -- almost four and a half 0 -- years older than me, and I’ve been always very, very close to her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  And what is her full name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Her full name is Ella Fabian. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And she married a -- a -- just about the only eligible Jewish boy who was left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span> after the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">He survived being put behind a false <span class="DLF">brick wall</span> , and two bricks were removed from time to time to feed him and take the soil out. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And he never regained his health, but she married him anyway, and they have two beautiful children. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">They are both medical doctors and I visit them quite often.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  And the grandparents you spoke of, would they have been your -- were they maternal?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  Well, my maternal grandmother is a lady of particular distinction that I talk about very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">She was the local marriage broker. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Did I ever tell the story about here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I would love to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  Oh, Grandmother Emma was really something very special. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">She was married to my maternal grandfather, Alexander Weiner, who was a master cabinetmaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">It was apparently a deep love because during the first World War, when he went to war, and no, he didn’t write for a couple of years, everybody thought that he died, and she got very, very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">At any rate, meanwhile she made a living by having a very small <span class="BUILDING">store</span> selling embroidery. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And this was embroidery patterns. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So when the little girls had to come in to start working on their trousseau, they had to come to Emma’s little <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> and she imprinted on their pieces of linen, patterns. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And 1n those days, my mother tells me, the girls had to start working on their trousseau at the age of five. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I mean -- I mean, if you didn’t get married by the time you were 19, you were really just not marriageable, or wa -- there was something wrong with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">At any rate, the girls started working on a trousseau, and because the girls had to come in and do very complex embroidery, my grandmother could tell how intelligent the girl was, and how industrious she was, which was two criteria, basically, for recommending somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So my maternal grandmother, Emma, apparently was known very widely in the whole community as absolutely reliable I.Q. testing that - that never made a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And so she made a living, b-both as a marriage broker, as well as a -- as a Seller of embroidery.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  So this would be done quite formally. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">People would pay for her advice?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  Oh yes, oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Marriage brokers were paid, and of course the other thing was that my grandfather Weiner made -- was known for making chests which were inlain -- inlaid -- h-he did very fine cabinetry. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">This was inlaid wood veneer. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And so, usually somebody who was a little wealthier, at the age of six or seven, they were starting to get on the queue with my grandfather Alexander, to start making a chest. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Well, Grandfather Weiner liked to drink, and so the delivery on these chests was always uncertain. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But he was a fun guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">He was always singing, he -- he -- he was really -- Grandfather Weiner took m-more c-care of me than anybody else in the family, because he had the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And I was then apprenticed to him at the age of 11, and he taught me how to do inlaid veneer. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So I worked for him for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">So it was a very colorful kind of an experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  And very loving.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  Well, yes and no. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">My father was a very tense person. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And -- and there was always a question -- course, I was -- I was a -- a child that caused trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I-I was known as the troublemaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I-I had a reputation as being a particularly rebellious child. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And years later some people tell me about kind of the pranks that I used to pull, and my father was a very stern task maker, and I just had to tow the <span class="DLF">line</span> and very often I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">But the rebellion was there to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">My mother was a very loving woman, but she was really the brains behind the business, we ran a big business, my father had a big business. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">She was the cashier. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">She was the peacemaker am-among the employees. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">She was very charitable. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">She was actually the head of the WIZO, which was the women’s Zionist organization, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Everybody loved her, a-although there were some women who wore a grudge against her because she stole the best man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And 1 -- years later, a woman who survived told me that she could have been my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">She was a -- she had her eye on -- on my father, except for that conniving matchmaker, your grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So that’s -- that’s -- these are the kinds of stories that one -- I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  What would be the kind of things that you would get up -- up to, and where did that rebelliousness come from, I wonder, in your case?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Where does the rebelliousness come from, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I was not considered to be a bright child. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I was not considered to be one of the leading scholars. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I mean, there were kids who were -- had better grades than I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I was always looking at things. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I-I must say that one of the memories that I have was that in the third grade - so I must have been eight years old, maybe less, I became very interested in condoms, which was a no-no thing in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I mean, that was totally out of -- out of bound for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And I did not know exactly what it was, but I was told this is really hush-hush. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Well, what happened is that through some arrangements, I got hold of a pack and brought them to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Now, that was considered to be -- I was badly beaten up. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">You know -- in those days, you know, the kids got physical punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I had to stretch my hands, and I got caned over my hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Now why I did it, I don’t know, but it should have sort of -- you know, I got a kick out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Particularly the -- the teacher, who was caning me, was an idiot. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And he didn't hear well, he didn’t speak well, didn’t see well. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">He was in his last year before retirement, and I think I just had to get at him one way or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So -- so, discipline was always a problem with -- with me, including some really bad st-stunts that I pulled on girls, but it’s -- it’s history.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  We'll get to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  Now, tell me the full names of your maternal grandparents and then I’d like to ask about your other grandparents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  Yeah, the maternal grandfather was Alexander Weiner, my mother’s -- she was born Weiner, Frances Weiner. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Her -- Alexander’s wife was Emma wa -- she died quite early, in the 30’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And -- and they really mer -- wro -- ma -- had a major imprint on -- on -- on my sensibility and understanding and -- and -- and -- and care. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">By the way, I just want you to know 1-is that Grandfather Weiner was a diabetic, which mean he had to eat early, and he -- he had to eat more frequently than anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">He made a mean garlic soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I mean, really strong garlic soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">To this day, a garlic soup, to me, is the best soup you can eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And my whole family is still kidding me about the fact that I will eat anything as long as it has garlic. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But it’s in memory of my grandfather.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  And your paternal grandparents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  Well, the paternal grandfather, Filip was a sick man, he had angina. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">He was a very withdrawn kind of a person, never talked too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">He was no fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">The -- the - he married a woman from a family that -- that had lots of aunts. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Oh, it was a huge, huge family. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And my paternal grandfather’s wife Anna was very small and she always liked to give me food that I didn’t get at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So her specialty was baked potatoes with lots of onions, garlic and when you render goose fat, the skin -- sh-she mixed that in. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And so for years I ate on that and of course when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I didn’t have an appetite, for which I was always punished, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  By the way, of your maternal grandfather, does any of his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> survive, do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  I recognize some of his pieces in the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> of the Gentiles that I visited after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">They vehemently desi -- [coughs] deny -- let me stop. [</span><span class="sentence" id="129">tape break]. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">You -- your question was about precious possessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">One of the things that I learned from the Holocaust is never to care for precious possessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I can walk away from this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> any time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  Yeah, because you’ve -- you -- you’ve learned from those experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  Yeah, what I learned from the experience is that the ability to walk away from something is very important, it’s [indecipherable] survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">If there is a major lesson I’ve learned from the Holocaust, it is my ability to just, when I see a problem, something going wrong, I just walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And -- and I would say that is a characteristic which is something very deeply ingrained in my behavior. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And if there is a single pattern that describes what I learned from the Holocaust, is that ability to walk away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  We’ll come back to that later in the interview, but because you’ve mentioned it, I will ask now about your decision to leave your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in 1948, when you, more than many others, had a reason to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">You had a heritage and things you could pick up
ANSWER:  Property, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">We had a heri -- heritage property. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I could have inhe -- I -- presumably I was inheriting lots of <span class="REGION">land</span> , <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">My decision to walk was much earlier than when people were forced out by the communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I -- although many of the Jews who came back, they were spending their time reclaiming properties and going to <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , and going through recovery and reclamation and restitution and all of this thing, I wanted no part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I didn’t -- never touched it in my years there. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I basically felt that the -- the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was poisoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">The people that I saw on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> when I walked, were -- were the people who were killing and stealing and robbing and -- and -- and committing crimes, including the people who gradually came to the forefront 1n a political position. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">These are people I knew from the uprising as criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">You know, I said, I just don’t want to live in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Just don’t want to be there, regardless. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So I told my sister, you take everything is here -- by the way, I never took a penny out of that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Never took a penny, I’ve never claimed anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I was never paid or made any claims to the Germans, although all the other Jews did. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Never wanted to touch it, that was tainted stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So this is -- this is a very important characteristic of my experience that -- that I did not cling -- I do not cling to things which are basically, in my view, morally evil. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">When you see anything that’s morally evil, wrong, you don’t stick around. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And -- and that is really the reason why, starting in 1946, the idea was, I’m not going to stick around, I’m just going to go wherever I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Of course, the idea was to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , where there was unlimited opportunity and nobody knew me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  Now, was it that clear cut in the beginning? </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I mean, th -- all -- did you rationally think through the pros and cons of leaving everything and going with nothing to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Well, the big moment, the big moment in my life, you know, in -- in other words, in -- when you look at life, there are only few things which are so called, a fulcrum. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And this is when you roll your dice, and if you don’t roll the dice right, you die. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">It’s -- it’s -- you know, it’s -- it’s -- or -- or perish, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">When the - when the uprising took place and -- and the Germans started persecuting Jews and partisans and arresting people, we went to predetermined <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> where we wo -- you know, hide and we -- the Christians are going to keep us hidden and we were going to crawl into the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , or crawl into a <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> or -- or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And, you know, these experiences, everybody has a different experience about what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which you may or may not recall from my interview, to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of an employee who was a very trusted interview -- employee of -- of my father’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">A long employee who owed very much to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">His wife was very unhappy, his wi -- by the way, the marriage was a bad marriage to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And she was grousing about, y-you -- you know, the Germans coming, finding me there and shooting the whole family because they to -- that is what the Germans were advertising, anybody hiding a Jew is going to be executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So I -- I was told to just go out to the -- near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and sit there during the day, when presumably the Germans were going to do <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to house searches and then come back at night and they’re going to feed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And the big decision, this is one of these fulcrum decisions which sort of imprinted me on my whole model, walking away. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">When I sat at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , I said, I’m not going to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I’m rather going to go take my chances where the shooting was than go back to what is presumably a safe <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Same thing happened in °48 -- or ’46, you know, I could have stayed there, but this idea of walking was by that time very heavily imprinted in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Also, th-that my behavior in -- in the partisans was very much -- a-as you know, during the partisan warfare, there’s always a little <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> where you can go to and some peasants will hide you or keep you for the night, so instead you being <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the frost, you’re going to come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and stay there and get fed. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Well, lots of partisans lost their life that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I just didn’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">There was always a bunch of guys who say, well, it’s just too dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So this idea of not necessarily staying comfortable, but doing the contrary thing is something which is not just Paul Strassmann, this 1s something, when you look at history of Jews -- I’m just finished reading for the second time Paul Johnson’s history of th -- of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">You know, when you say, well how did the Jews survive for, you know, whatever thousand years it was, you know, how did they move from -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sumer</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Canaan</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Assyria</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babylon</span> and back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And then went to <span class="COUNTRY">Persia</span> , then went to -- to -- to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Damascus</span> and to <span class="COUNTRY">Anatolia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Th-The -- the wandering Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Well, the survival of the Jews was one that they always were ready to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">They would have stayed put, they would have died and perished like everybody else who stayed put. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So this is not just a Paul Strassmann kind of an imprint, it’s just deeply -- now whether it’s genetic, I doubt, but it is, what do you call it, r-racial, or religious or psychological orientation. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">It’s something that -- that very much has been a pattern of everything I’ve done and how I’ve progressed in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  It could be, I suppose, this real survival instinct. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I had -- on the one hand, you could say that you’re -- certainly with the partisans you’re -- you seemed to have nine lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">You were young, you were taking risks, but it’s an interesting to -- way to -- to look at it, that it was in your blood, that it’s part of the -- part of your heritage. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And there does seem to be moral overtones, that rather than hiding, you were taking an active role that might make things better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">ANSWER:  Yeah, in fact my son that I lost was very much interested in the subject, and -- and he was a brilliant, brilliant scholar at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And he always wanted to know, you know, what -- what makes it tick? </span><span class="sentence" id="192">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Give me an equation, you know, give -- give me something quantitative. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Because you know, I always do things quantitatively. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And I said, well, a-as you know, in -- in games theory and in mathematics, and in gaming, there are things called algorithms, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And so he wanted to know, what’s the algorithm. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And anythi -- in conversation with my son, then I said, you know, the -- the -- the algorithm in life is that you always want to migrate to where your number of options that you have, increase. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So the algorithm is that if you are somewhere 1n what’s called a mathematical sack, cul-de-sac, you’re down to one option. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And so in gaming theory -- this is called option theory, by the way, and by the way Van Neumann did a formal analysis of this [indecipherable] so -- so there’s a mathematical basis for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">In gaming theory you have to look always for <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , for more options, even if 1t costs you more, because once you have more options, even if the price is higher, the probability of you possibly doing better is greater than if you are what’s called, in a zero sum game. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Cul-de-sac, it’s called -- in -- in mathematics, by the way, this is called a knapsack. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I mean, there is formal theory over this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And my -- my second son Steven, who has a Ph.D. from M.I.T., he -- he -- he’s a -- he’s acclass one nerd, you know, mathematics, everything has to be quantitative. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">You know, one day I just on a napkin, drew for him this whole theory of life, that life is really of maximizing your options. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">That’s what life is. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">In fact, when you look at the -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B
ANSWER:  According to this theory of option, 1t means that if you stay hidden in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of an employee whose wife is sort of a hostile party to this whole deal, you are basically cooped up and there’s no options. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I mean, you are just totally wedged in, and you have no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">When you are just in shorts, and with a t-shirt and sandals, and one sandwich, in the reeds of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Vah</span> , and going back two miles is that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , or going forward, actually swimming down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and then going to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> where shooting takes place, that’s more options. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So you go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Now you spoke very critically of that wife and that being a bad marriage and -- in your earlier interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">QUESTION:  What -- did you know, in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> , much about that woman? </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I assume she could not be trusted, and you were at risk in the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">ANSWER:  Well, about that wife I knew very little, except that the a -- other employees were- were always joshing this man, who was my father’s confidant, about this wife that he picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And I picked up enough sort of, innuendo, to -- that my -- my -- my radar said, well there’s something f-funny in here. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Y- You must understand, in the back of my father’s <span class="BUILDING">store</span> were, you know, were the merchandise and were the -- we loaded <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">There was lots of rough play and -- and -- and -- among the employees and of course I always mixed around and listened. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And I picked up that this was one unhappy, henpecked husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So -- so, you know, but yo-you just factor that in -- into the equation. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">The fact that they didn’t want me to stay <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and you know, this was only the second day. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I was there only one night. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">On the second day, get out, you know, was enough of a signal that I would have no options at all because when the Germans really started looking for people and doing <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to house searches, I would have no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">QUESTION:  Let’s go back for a moment, because we’ve jumped from your early childhood --
ANSWER:  Yes, that’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">QUESTION:  -- to this period when you w-were in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And tell me a -- the context of what had taken place by then, and what had happened to your father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  Well, the tragedy was -- is that the -- my father greatly mistimed the whole issue of how we will survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Ye -- we received, in 1942 at the end -- towards the end of the deportation, a presidential exception, which also covered the grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Grandfather Weiner was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but it was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slovak concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">The Slovaks kept some of the carpenters, and some of the Jewish craftsman to make <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and artifacts for the Slovak new powers. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So they kept a camp where the Jews were slave laborers, but they did -- were not shipped to- to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">annihilation camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So Grandfather Alexander was in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novaky</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">My father, because of his prior connection with a very distinguished Catholic priest, by name of Bernetsky, really an outstanding friend of my father, secured a presidential protection, so that we were not deported in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">But we always knew that the day of reckoning will come when the front moves in from the east, and the Germans retreat. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">At that time, there will be wholesale destruction and annihilation and murder and who knows what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And so, starting in ’43, we started rehearsing where do we go, where do we hide when the front moves. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">My father had set up a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , and then a fall-back hiding place and a third <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">In other words, there were like three <span class="NPIP">places</span> to go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">When the -- the beginning of the uprising, but it was not so full born yet, but when the guerilla attacks started -- it was precipitated, by the way, by the -- by the communists, for reasons which -- that’s another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">We decided to go to back-up place number one, which was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Selec</span> , which is not too far from -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span> , in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">peasant village</span> , there was peasant who was for money and my father already provided food and what have you, we’re going to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Well, when my father decided to -- to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Selec</span> , well then, there were other people who my father was obligated to. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">My father inherited from his partner, who I may or may not have mentioned, by name of Kubicek. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Kubicek went to the Zionist congress in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span> in 1938 and never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">My father took over custody of his wife and his son. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So -- and there were two aunts, so my father took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> from the business, loaded everybody and in we go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Selec</span> to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Of course, the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> saw that here comes a whole bunch of Jews, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">It was just not well thought out. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">So we were there for two days, which was, I think August 27 and 28 and my father recognized this was really -- 1t was just too noisy, there were just too many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And everybody was in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So the decision was to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span> and regroup and start going into <span class="NPIP">places</span> where everybody will go in onesies or twosies --
QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  -- to <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Well, that night Gestapo came and took my father as a hostage, and my grandfather Weiner. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And just happens that that night I was not sleeping at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Of course, we were, by that time, living in very, very low, low -- low kinds of <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> , you know, <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> that was very, very low grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">You know, it was out in the boonies. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I think we had only one <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and one <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , so it was crowded anyway, so I stayed with a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So in the morning I was told the family was taken, my father was taken, and therefore I should go now to contingency place number three, which was the -- this employee, so -- so within three days, we went from contingency one to contingency two, to cont-contingency three like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And these -- so you were at the end of the rope by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And it was still now only September one or September two, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">So you were out of an -- a-- arope, you’re at the end of the rope now, already, and the -- you know, the show only started, I mean the -- the bad times only started now. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So that th -- was the context under which I said, this is a bad option. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I mean, I have no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">QUESTION:  And how old were you then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  15. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Iwas 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I was a sturdy 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Really experienced hiker. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Because I couldn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at the age of 11, my father apprenticed me to my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">When my grandfather was shipped to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , I was then apprenticed to work in a <span class="BUILDING">machine shop</span> , which was a wonderful experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And in the <span class="BUILDING">machine shop</span> we were fixing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">threshing machines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And 1 -- the -- in -- in those days they didn’t have ball bearings, so they had bushings made out of copper, and when they didn’t oil it properly the copper melted, so you had to re -- ream the bushings, and I learned pouring, holding the mold when people were pouring metal to make a bushing and then reaming it out and fitting axels into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I -- the people in the <span class="BUILDING">machine shop</span> were a bunch of real tough guys, including one guy who was wounded in the Spanish Civil War, in a communist brigade. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Was a rough guy, and who subsequently became the commissar of one of the battalions and was guilty of enormous atrocities. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And after the war he became the deputy chairman of the communist party. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And he was one of the guys why I decided, with that guy around, I -- I don’t want to live in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="288">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">ANSWER:  And of course the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> I come from used to be a <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> all the way going back to Roman times. </span><span class="sentence" id="290"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span> was the last <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> -- mountain pass from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Carpathian mountains</span> into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">D-Danube</span> [indecipherable] and the Romans were -- had their advance camp in there and on the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> , I will show the picture if you’re interested in. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">It was a huge, <span class="BUILDING">medieval castle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And we used to, you know, at -- at -- at seven years old our favorite game was to go into the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> and play cops and robbers and Crusaders and particularly figuring out how to defeat the Turks, because the Turks used to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span> and devastate the population, so -- so, you know, th-that environment was already that kind of a mental process. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">This was not a mamby-pamby kind of a protected environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">ANSWER:  And of course, starting in ’37 - 38, we were badly beaten up by the hooligans, as Jews, you know, so we had to go in packs on the <span class="DLF">street</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  Oh yes, oh -- well, meanwhile, my father, of course, paid for piano lessons, which we couldn’t afford, and for English, you know, I -- starting in ’38. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">But we always knew -- you know, my father’s ideal life -- I mean, he alway -- was to move out of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> -- <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , move to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , put his son into an <span class="BUILDING">English school</span> , and live in a setting like I live in right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">A <span class="DLF">garden</span> and privacy and quietness. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And th-that was his idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">My father’s idea of life was to live like an English gentleman, reading books and -- and -- and writing, and -- and -- and -- and- and not -- not having to deal with this tremendous pressure, this enormous social pressure which existed in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="313">ANSWER:  Well, in some respect it was a sense of betrayal, because I did not know -- see, nobody ever told me what the plan was. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I did not have any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I did not know what the financial arrangements were. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">See, part of the problem was that I was a big blabber. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And my father really didn’t share too many things with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">So -- you see, the assumption was always that dad will take care of everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">This idea that I, at the age of 15 would be independent, and have to make decisions on my own, I don’t think that was on the agenda. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">See, the assumption always was, the father of the family will sort of direct everybody and decide who goes where. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And so part of this experience was that here I was with no clothing, just wol -- told, why don’t you go to this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">No -- there was no question of money, what the arrangements were, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I didn’t know what the deal was. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I did not know where it leads, what was the further fall back, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So not knowing anything, I finally decided, well, you know, you either sit here, go back and do what everybody else was doing, or just get -- get on with something. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And I guess that was the -- the -- the decisive moment, because had I stayed, I would have been -- sure ended up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">They -- they would have surely found me and shipped me off.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="345">ANSWER:  Well, there was a few wrinkles with this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">We had to get baptized, and the question was, well what’s the faster ways of getting baptized? </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Well, to become baptized as a Catholic -- and Bernetsky offered that, was a very complicated thing, and you know, the timing was short. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">My father was very good friends also -- because my father was one of the leading citizens in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , with the senior -- the -- which he’s a sort of a -- like a auxiliary bishop, by name of Zimon, a wonderful scholar of the <span class="BUILDING">Lutheran church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And so in 1942, after a proper course in catechism and so forth -- which I did very well, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Frankly, I liked the catechism better than I liked the Jewish stuff because I could understand it, you know, it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slovak</span> and it was sort of interesting, historically. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And -- you know, and Jesus was a Jew, so it must have been okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And also, the beautiful thing about the -- the Lutherans is th-the organ music. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">You see, the Jews didn’t have music in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , only wailing, you know, the -- no music. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">The -- the <span class="BUILDING">Lutheran church</span> had a wonderful organ and then in the <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> they had a harmonium, which I used to like to play on. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">But, you know, the -- the -- the s -- the psalms, you know, mostly old -- this -- this was Lutheran of the Augsburg persuasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I don’t know you understand the -- Lutherans -- Lutherans come in various flavors, you understand that? </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">There was lots of Old Testament songs, which have been -- which have been -- which are sung, according to music [indecipherable] by Johann Sebastian Bach. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And they’re beautiful, they’re absolutely beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">So I had a great time with the Lutherans. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Everybody knew, of course, that I was a baptized Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I mean, y-you know, in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , everybody could tell that. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">But 1 -- you know, it was just -- just wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">I -- I really just meant that distinction between those who hid their Jewishness, and y-you were really, as a family, not doing that, but also assuming this membership in the <span class="BUILDING">Lutheran church</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">ANSWER:  Yeah, and a -- a -- yeah, we -- we were not hiding anything, there was no way of hiding it. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I mean, everybody knew who s -- Adolf Strassman, my father was and who I am, but -- but 1-it was a convenient way, and the Lutherans who were a minority in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> sort of felt that they were -- and the Lutherans never went in with this Nazi stuff anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I mean, in the ar -- in the underground, much of the pro-western connection -- 1 -- yi -- as you know there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> underground and there was a Soviet underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">The -- the Soviet underground was a bunch of atheists and -- and -- and quasi-criminal element. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">The intellectual underground in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> was mostly Lutheran. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And I turned out to be quite a scholar in -- in Lutheran affairs, and of course I went, you know, the catechism, answered all the questions and -- and -- and -- you know, I -- I did just fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I enjoyed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So -- so yi - y -- sort of everybody went along with this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">It was a very interesting period.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="376">ANSWER:  I have only warmest memories on -- on that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I mean, in -- in the period of the war, which is 1942 to 1944, it provided a period of relative stability.</span></p>

ANSWER:  -- balderdash. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">I don’t believe that, but -- but 1f she was or she wasn’t, a -- I mean, there -- there was no point of hiding it, if -- I mean, these are small circumstances, small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Now she u -- if she came from a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , and I don’t know of the detail, it’s possible that the thing was sort of expunged, but in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> there was no way of forgetting who was a Jew, and who wasn’t a Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">QUESTION:  I just thought that -- that th -- the practices and the things done to help s -- Jews survive in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> might differ from what was happening in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , and that therefore --

<p><span class="sentence" id="382">QUESTION:  -- her case -- that it shed some light on her story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">ANSWER:  Yeah, I -- I -- I -- I --I -- I’m sure of that and you know, that the conditions were different in <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">For instance, I -- I happened to be presiding last year at the <span class="DLF">Bulgarian memorial</span> , and it was very interesting for me, th-that was a totally different approach of solving the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">The -- the -- you know, ge-getting a presidential except -- exception, the white paper, and by saying, well yeah, but that you also converted to Christianity, you know, that was another check mark and that was Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">At least in ’42 it was -- you know, in September of 1944, all the bets were off, I mean, none of that applied.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">But what was happening in your family’s story, where your father previously seems to have been masterfully studying strategies --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="389">QUESTION:  -- is most interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I mean, yo-you suggest that with some forward thinking and astuteness, you could work the system, to some extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">ANSWER:  That is correct, you could work the system as long as options were available. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Once the Germans took over, there were no options. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I mean, they eliminated all options, I mean, there was -- y-ye -- if you were a Jew, baptized or otherwise, you know, your -- you were either shot or shipped to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Now you were 10 when the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">ANSWER:  No, th-the Germans did not occupy <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">The Germans occupied only the <span class="COUNTRY">Czech Republic</span> and they created what’s called the Protectorat. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">They did not occupy <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">They made a deal with Monsignor Tiso to create a Slovak state, because they just had their hands full, and th-they wanted to draw on the military capability of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , which was quite considerable. </span><span class="sentence" id="400"><span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> ultimately put up 92,000 soldiers working for the Germans, fighting with the Germans against the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So the Slovak, two divisions went into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , advancing all the way to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Caucasian mountains</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  But it was -- it was that -- well, really my question is, your life would change dramatically when you were 10, am I right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">ANSWER:  Yes, yeah, life changed dramatically because the Aryan laws were put into effect by the Slovak legislature, following the script, the German script, and that means Jews were stripped, in a very methodical way of all property, all privileges. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And it was a bureaucratically highly organized process of taking property away. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">The -- it was very important that the various people who owed their loyalty to the Nazis and to the Slovak, were getting as much property as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So it started as a way of stripping the Jews of property, shipping most of the Jews, like 85 percent of the Jews into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">annihilation camps</span> , and then whoever was left, depriving them of all the civil rights and -- and property and radios and fur coats and -- and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span> , and- and -- you know, th-there was a long list, I still have those lists of what you can or cannot do, and what <span class="DLF">street</span> you can be on, what is your curfew, whether you can have a <span class="DLF">window</span> looking at the <span class="DLF">street</span> , or not looking at the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I mean it was a very elaborate, bureaucratic structure that got erected to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And, you know, as time went on, you know, things got closed down. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">The <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> got closed down, the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> got closed down. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Going to a movie got closed down and so forth and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And it -- it was -- there was -- it was always a next step.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">QUESTION:  And when you were living in poor <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">QUESTION:  -- in what you describe as a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> , but it -- 1t would be a couple of <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , that would have happened within the space of a couple of years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">First we had a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that my father built in 1933, which was on top of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> on the main, <span class="DLF">commercial streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">So, immediately we could not live in the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> which were facing the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417">That was -- immediately we were pushed down into the two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> which were behind, not looking over the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">So that went on for about eight month or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Then came an ordinance that you cannot live on that <span class="DLF">street</span> altogether. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">So then we moved to another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , a <span class="INT_SPACE">one bedroom apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">It was a very small <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , an upstairs walk-up, not too far from our original <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And we were there for maybe a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Then an ordinance was passed that you cannot be even there, because it was ho -- it had hot and cold water. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Jews cannot be in any <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where there is both hot water and cold water. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">So we had to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> which was really, you know, a slum, beca -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A

Did you ever go back and look at your old <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  We -- I surely did. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I -- my father’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> , when I finished my officer course in 1945, in a military uniform and with a Tommy gun, I just walked in at two o’clock in the morning, banged at the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And of course it was occupied by the people who took over my father’s business. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">They were absolutely petrified, you know, it was immediately after the war, and I was basically a political officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">You -- you must understand that when I got out of the partisans, I was considered to be an exceptionally reliable person to be used for whatever purpose, such as eth -- ethnic cleansing, you know, I was ready to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And so I went back as soon as I could to find out if anybody was alive and of course they were petrified, they immediately moved out of the front -- <span class="INT_SPACE">front rooms</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , to the back, where we used to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And I stayed there one night. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I wa-wanted no part of it, I found out nobody knew about anything about my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">All they knew that my mother was found shortly after she went into hiding and that nobody knew where my sister was, and everybody knew that my father was shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">So -- so that was in ’45, I immediately went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Since then a v -- you know, under the communists, I couldn’t go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">The -- it was shut down in 1948, when the communists took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">First time I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span> was in -- maybe in 1978 or ’79. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">By that time the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was razed and a huge monster complex was built up as -- for Soviet kind of <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">But I go there now at least once a year, sometimes twice a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I just finished a very major project in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span> , which may be of interest to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">When I went there in 1986, I went finally to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , which of course was converted into some kind of a <span class="BUILDING">music hall</span> , but next to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was a small <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> , and everything was piled in, what that was left from the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> into the <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">It was a warehou -- 1-it was a ma -- badly messed up <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> , that’s all 1t was, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> were stacked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> were the names of the Jews that perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">1536 names. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And they were just printed on pieces of paper that was curling and getting mildew. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And there on the spot I decided that that is not going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And after four years of work, and getting people from all over the world to cooperate, last year we unveiled 24 bronze tablets with the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I paid for it, just about all of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And it is now a <span class="INT_SPACE">sanctuary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">So I’ve been back -- I mean, this idea of getting that memorial up into the -- into that <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> was very time consuming. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I must have made like 10 trips negotiating with various people. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">See, the Jews didn’t want to have any part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">They didn't want to stir trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So -- but finally I -- y-you know, it got very complicated. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Nobody wanted any part of it, you know, why do you want to stir things up? </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Well, I stir things up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  Would there be repercussions fo -- th-that the Jews would suffer f-f --
ANSWER:  The few Jews, and I think there are eight or nine, that’s all there is, and they’re all in their 80’s like my sister, want to be left alone, peaceful. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">They don’t want to be bothered. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">They don’t want to be called Jew, or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">So their idea is to lay low, and if there’s one thing this guy doesn’t do, it’s lay low, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="466">So -- but ultimately, people came from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for the unveiling. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I think they were more interested in talking to one another who survived, because they grew up all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">These are the survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">They’re looking at the <span class="DLF">memorial</span> , but that’s okay, that <span class="DLF">memorial</span> is go -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s wedged into the <span class="DLF">wall</span> with deep rivets. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Th -- it’s -- it’s heavy metal, like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">So it’s fairly indestructible, I mean, you would -- really would have to blow it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And I just feel good about it, and to hell with everybody else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">QUESTION:  And there had been Jews a -- I understand in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span> since -- I as -- somewhere I saw that first records were of 1760, perhaps before that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  Oh, Jews have been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span> , you know, I mean for -- the records go back to about the 11" century, because you see, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span> was always a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military town</span> , it was a base. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">It was always a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">government town</span> , it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">trading town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And so Jewish traders came and gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">That’s why you have those large co -- concentration of Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Because the Jews were basically the lawyers and the record keepers and the -- the -- the Hungarian and Austro-Hungarian nobility used Jews as their record keepers, as their bookkeepers. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">See, the [indecipherable] never wanted to be tainted by anything commercial. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So they -- and they actually, as you know the history, they invited the Jews to come in to help them to manage <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and -- and many of those <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , because the Jews were totally dependent on the nobility. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And so there was a very large Jewish population and the Jews were being used as a money gatherer because the Jews really were, until about 1860 could not own <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">So the Jews were used as instrument of feudal oppression and tax collection, which of course was one of the sources of anti-Semitism, which was deeply endemic in that part, particularly among the peasantry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">QUESTION:  Now, you talk in your earlier interview about anti-Semitism being essentially an urban phenomenon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">ANSWER:  Yes, well because the Jews were urban.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">The jur -- the Jews were, of course, here and there, sitting in the -- in the properties, where they were maintaining property, and they were innkeepers. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">But that was p -- all part of the taxation mechanism that the feudal regime maintained. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">See, the feudal lords, they don’t want to mess around with that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">QUESTION:  Now, I’m -- I’m going back again, but from whom would you have learned about what happened to your father, and when would you know that he’d been taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> and tortured?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">ANSWER:  I knew it from secondhand, of his torturing, because when I got back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span> as a political officer, I was hell bent to even some scores. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And we were interrogating a number of people, and I j-just found out what happened, because everybody was saying, well it wasn’t me. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">It turned out that the Slovaks, jointly with the local Germans went -- and they had a list of hostages that they wanted to pick up, people who were suspect as working with the partisans, you see, because my father managed the food business, even under the Slovak regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">My father made sure that some food got moved into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="495">So my father was on the list for a collaborator.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">QUESTION:  So that you -- you learned that later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Now, y -- t-to what extent did you settle scores? </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I think you make some reference to ugly times, or whatever, initially after --
ANSWER:  I -- well -- le-let me -- le-let me say, looking back at it, I really didn’t settle any scores. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I really did not kill anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">There were some people that I testified against, because of some of the acts that they committed, but they were let go anyway, so -- so there was no scores to settle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">QUESTION:  Again I want to go back to ask you about th-the fact that your family did not leave in 1938, when th-they had made preparations to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And you tell the story in your earlier interview about your mother as treasurer --

<p><span class="sentence" id="508">ANSWER:  Absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">QUESTION:  And did he ever speak about -- with regret about not going, or -- ju -- I’d just like to know more about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Th -- as I noted before, during the bad years, which is ’39 through ’44, the parents really didn’t speak much. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">They -- they -- they felt that -- that -- that I was a potential source of -- of leaks. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Of course, my sister subsequently told me that she also did not know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">I think it was just the way my father and my mother operated is they -- they wanted to keep everything very tight. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Also, in those days you did not speak to your children as peers. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">It was a different social structure. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Children were there to be told what to do, to be educated, to be trained. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And -- and - and you had obligations, it was almost a feudal kind of a relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">It’s not the American way, you know, where -- you know, the conversation between the father and the mother and the children is fairly free, at least in my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">So we -- we just didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">We didn't know their thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">But have you put yourself in your father’s shoes, and it does seem to me that the reason he chose not to leave with his immediate family was because of that responsibility to the extended family --
ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Well, yes, clearly, the responsible for the extended family and particularly to his parents, he was very devoted to his father. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">He went and visited his father every night. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And th -- he could not get his father out. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I mean, we had passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">You must understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">In 1938, my father, my mother, my sister and I had pass -- valid passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">We could have walked out any time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">QUESTION:  Did your parents ever regret this, do you think? </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Or was it an unspoken regret, if that was there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">ANSWER:  It was unspoken, it was never discussed. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">They never discussed, you know, what could have happened, or what didn’t happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">That was never discussed, not to my best knowledge, and neither to my sister’s knowledge, who was older and she says she didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">She just didn’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">QUESTION:  Mm. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And I assume that this would be what would happen in so many families where it would be possible for some members to leave, but it’s very hard to leave close relatives behind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  Well, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I -- I would say that -- that the fir-fir-first -- everybody always said that nobody expected it to be so bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">There was this old pattern, well somehow we’re going to mu -- muddle through. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">You know, this also will come to pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I don’t know if you’ve seen the movie, “The Pianist”. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">You remember the early scene- by the way, I only saw the first eight minutes of the thing, and then I wa -- got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">There they are, ready to move out and leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and they hear on the radio, Churchill announces that <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> is going ag-against -- in war against the Germans and they all have a big party because all their problems are solved. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">You remember that scene? </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Well, that scene was repeated again and again and again. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">This is denial. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">The -- the -- much of the existence in those days was denial. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">People were denial -- were in denial all the way to the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , and even then they were in denial.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">QUESTION:  Why do you think that was so? </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Is that human nature?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">ANSWER:  Well, I don’t know about what is human nature, but -- but a-a-as you know, when you have no option -- this goes back to my options theory, okay, if you have no option, if you are -- if you have only one option, and that’s all you have, the only thing you can do about it, if it’s a horrible option, is to deny it. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">You don’t want to face up to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">ANSWER:  See, the moment you have options, you cannot do denial because you then have to confront -- you know, of the three or four things that I can do, which one will I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Then you have to go into so -- irrational process. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So if you are pretty well set in a given groove, denial will be the most natural way to try to deal with it, other than committing suicide.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">QUESTION:  And it helps to protect your children, and your spouse, and --

<p><span class="sentence" id="560">QUESTION:  -- and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Tell me what happened to your mother and your sister after your father was taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">ANSWER:  Well, Mother went into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for hiding, you know, she -- she already knew this was fallback number three, she went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">My sister didn’t like fallback number three, but she had false papers, so she went and took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , where she worked as a servant. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">My mother was betrayed in 30 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Somebody said, well there is a Jewess in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Most likely, of course, 1t was given that she was betrayed by the people who were keeping her. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">My sister was picked up on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , somebody recognized her. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And my mother was shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrick</span> and so was my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">My sister barely made it, I mean she was this close. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">She -- she then did the forced march. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">M-My mother died of typhoid. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">My sister was very sick and she was on this forced march and they were shooting anybody who was a straggler, and she just fell down and two of her friends picked her up and walked her. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">That’s how she survived.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="582">QUESTION:  That sounds much like your feelings, initially.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">ANSWER:  Initially. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">But she had no -- no -- she had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">She just went to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And once you were in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and you were moving up 1n an open, sooner or later they’re going to get you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">QUESTION:  I wonder if you feel, or you have any memory of when you were on your own, whether you have any sense that you clung to f-fond memories of childhood, and did they wa -- ho -- wa -- did that give you strength to keep going? </span><span class="sentence" id="588">As an observer it would seem to me that -- that start that you had 1n life, of security and a -- and an extended family, a really stable, good background would give you reserves, sort of inner reserves that might help you to keep going, but do you -- do you consciously have any thoughts? </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Do you remember having memories of family times?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">ANSWER:  Le-Let me sa -- tell you very, very clearly on this one. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">None. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">The -- the -- the conditions were so brutal and so difficult, that just coping with the here and now, and what do next totally occupied me. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">There was no -- looking back would be -- have been a weakness. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">So if you’re totally occupied with trying to make the next step, the -- you know, the next sortie, the next raid, the next piece of clothing that you need because winter is coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">The -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the struggle for survival in -- on a very brutal military conditions was so extreme that looking back was really not very useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And -- and I usually don’t look back. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">It was interesting, about two days ago I had a conversation with my daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">She had a contract that expired early in 2003, and the people paid her for awhile, and then she protested and so they finally gave her a new contract. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And th -- it’s a nice contract, it’s a three year contract. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">The question was, they didn’t pay her for about four month and there was a back pay issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And her husband screamed at her that she should not sign a contract because th-they owe her back pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I say, forget about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Forget about back pay, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">It’s gone, you know”? </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Look forward, they’re giving you a good deal for the next three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Take it and run.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">QUESTION:  Move on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="608">ANSWER:  Move on. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So this idea of move on and the -- the -- the -- that is the only thing that -- that -- that is important. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Except when it comes something very close, like the death of my son. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">That you -- that’s something that -- that sort of looms because that is a d-deep wound. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">But, you know, whether you had a nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and nice clothing and nice this and tha -- that’s -- that’s -- doesn’t matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">That’s the -- that’s easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">That’s -- you can walk away from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">For instance, during the Cuban crisis, I picked up my children and moved them out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">upstate New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">You know, we had a nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mount Vernon</span> , so what? </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I mean, I mean, this means nothing.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="630">ANSWER:  Yeah, and get an education. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I mean, the important thing in life is to get an education, get a wife, and have a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and live as closely as your father talked about, namely live somewhere with a <span class="DLF">garden</span> , and -- and have children and -- and -- and have peace and quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">It’s that simple.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="635">ANSWER:  Okay, the logis -- the logistics was that I knew the communists would be taking over, because they actually came over and said, you know, Strassman, you’re a hero, but you are the son of a capitalist. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Would you do us a favor and just go? </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So, a very close, wonderful friend of my father, who was if so -- so -- who was a brother- in-law of the man who went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span> -- you know, my father took care of a mother and a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">ANSWER:  So they went to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> right away because he was an American citizen, so he could get his wife and his son to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I, of course, was not a relative, but he issued an affidavit for me and put me on the immigration waiting list. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">My immigration visa hadn’t come through in °47, or even 48, but the brother- in-law of this man who was in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , a very wonderful guy, said, look Strassmann, you better get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">You better get out while the getting is good. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So he found a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> which was teaching electronics, who signed me up for a course. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And with that course and the fact that I’d all kinds of certificates and what have you, plus the fact that I paid 50,000 dollars for a passport, I was able to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> with a -- one suitcase and no money, on February the seventh, of 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">The communists took over on February the 15", and shut the <span class="NPIP">place</span> down.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1293">ANSWER:  But that’s not the way I play the game. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">If they would have wanted to fire me, this was not going to be a company for me to work for anyway, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">Years later, I’m wi -- quite an expert, I write a couple of books about computers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">General Motors buys EDS, this big corporation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">EDS takes over all computers from General Motors, it’s a absolute disaster. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">Ross Perot gets greedy, starts charging General Motors excess money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">General Motors plant managers don’t get any bonuses, EDS gets all the bonuses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">So the vice-chairman of General Motors is given the job to find out whether EDS is overcharging or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">Guess who they hire? </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">Paul Strassmann. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">You see, I don’t have any consultants, I don’t have -- I don’t bring in a big staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">I am a well known expert in the <span class="DLF">fie-field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">I study the situation, I call up the vice- chairman of General Motors and say, look, they’re overcharging you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">And then he - he says, well how much are they overcharging me? </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">They are overcharging you at least 300 million dollars a year, which is quite a bit of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">And it’s actually more, but 300 million dollars you can prove. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">So he says, you know, this is very difficult, Ross Perot is on the Board of Directors of General Motors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">I have to bring it up before the board. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">Why don’t you write a half page memorandum, stand by until the board meeting and just before the board meeting you fax it to my secretary outside of the board meeting and I’Il read it to the board. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">Which he does -- I mean, this was going to be hush-hush. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">By three o’clock in the afternoon every plant manager in General Motors who hates the guts of EDS has a copy of Strassmann’s memo that they’re overcharged by 300 million doll -- which is out of their pocket, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1314">QUESTION:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1315">ANSWER:  So General Motors says, you know, sorry, you know, this really caused all kinds of problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">We’re going to pay you your fee, but we cannot employ you any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">I come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , Mona tells me, you know, Strassmann, again, you know, you just play it straight, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">You missed a great opportunity getting a consulting contract from General Motors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">You -- couldn’t you have varnished it a little or something? </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">I say, well that’s the way it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">Six months later, the vice-chairman of General Motors is now deputy secretary of defense, working for Dick Cheney. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">Soviet Union collapses --
QUESTION:  Who -- who would that be?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1323">ANSWER:  Donald Atwood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1324">QUESTION:  Okay I mean a -- wondered if I knew the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">Anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1326">ANSWER:  Yeah, Donald Atwood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1327">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">That’s not the point, it’s [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  W-We -- Congress decides [indecipherable] dividend, cuts the department of ar - Department of Defense budget by 75 billion dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">And Cheney turns to Donald Atwood say, well you know, find the 75 billion dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">Donald can find 30, but there is -- he’s short, you know, he’s short quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">So he said, well we are going to do it by corporate information [indecipherable] we are going to bring into the department of defer -- corporate information management based on computers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">You know, this is -- this is -- this is a holy grail, you know, every couple of years this idea perks up and dies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1333">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1334">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">And I am just the bastard who knows how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">And guess what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">I get pulled into the Department of Defense as the first Chief Information Officer of the Department of Defense --
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1338">ANSWER:  -- to do the job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1339">QUESTION:  And I assume you were much needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1340">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">I mean, everybody agrees and you know, I and -- you know, I [indecipherable] I don’t know how many billions I saved, but I at least set the thing in a direction -- finally Rumsfeld is doing it now, but it takes a long time to move that -- that thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">But again, you know, who would have known that by calling the shots on General Motors, would end -- will end me up in this -- this position. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">So there’s a story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1344">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1345">ANSWER:  Now, just to show you how luck or opportunity works, I get into the Department of Defense, and I look around, and I say, well what’s wrong is computers report to the controller. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">Computers should not report to the controller because finance people just keeps computers under throttle, computers is a weapon, it’s a military weapon, it’s a command and control weapon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">Let’s yank out the computers away from the controller. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">Now, to do that in the Department of Defense, I mean, 1s -- this is hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1349">QUESTION:  Rock the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1350">ANSWER:  Tha-That’s really rocking the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">We rocked the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , guess what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">Donald Atwood wanted to do it anyway, now he pulls the responsibility for computers away from the controller of the depart -- where it has been for the prior 50 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">The controller of the Department of Defense is a guy by the name of Sean O’Keefe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">So we -- we make an enemy right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">So we take it out, we bring it under and the assistant Secretary of Defense for command and control, the military loves me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">The military just loves me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">I get a big checkbook, I start spending money on the special forces, who until then didn’t get the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">They make me an honorary Green Beret, they find out that I was a guerilla fighter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">Boy, this is one of our guys, he’s one of ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">And of course, I give them the money, you know, I move the money away from finance and give it to the war fighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">I mean, you can’t go wrong, I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">So the story then goes, I retire from the Department of Defense with all the honors, you know, but when Clinton gan -- comes in, that’s not the <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me to be, I mean, I just can’t stand the guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">NASA gets into trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">The new administrator of NASA is one Sean O’ Keefe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">He says, I know just the bastard to straighten out this <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1366">QUESTION:  Well, he -- yo-you made an enemy of him, but he could see that the action taken was right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1367">ANSWER:  No, what happens is that people disagree with me, but everybody respects me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1368">QUESTION:  Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1369">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">And so I get a call that, you know, would you like to do some consulting for NASA? </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">So I -- sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">I come down to <span class="COUNTRY">NASA</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">They showed me everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">I didn’t know I was walking into a setup. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">I ga -- arrive at <span class="COUNTRY">NASA</span> at nine o’clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">They give me the review of the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">I said, you guys are just in an awful mess. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">Okay, Mr. Strassmann, what would do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">I said, well there are three things you have to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">Well, you know, now it’s 3:30 in the afternoon, would you like to walk up and present your findings to the administrator? </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">I walk in, oh Paul, so nice to see you, so glad to see -- you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">I present the thing, and he said, well, you know, that makes awful sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">Guess what, you’re staying here and you’re going to fix it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">I said, well I’m here for a consulting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">No, you’re coming -- you’re staying here and fixing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">I say, well you cannot appoint me to a senior executive position in the federal government that easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">He said, you think I can’t? </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">So he said, well, will you take it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">I say, well, you know, I am a servant of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">If - if am asked to do something -- he says, just wait a moment, picks up the phone, brings in lawyers, what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">I walk at 6:30 that evening with a badge, as the Chief Information Officer of NASA. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">Now, the question is luck, opportunity, or what, but there is a pattern. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">You know, I have many stories like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1394">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1395">ANSWER:  I mean, lots of stories like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">The -- the -- the paradigm of the Holocaust, the -- coming back to the Holocaust is that what I learned from the Holocaust is that there is always opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">You cannot stay in a <span class="NPIP">position</span> where there’s no opportunity, because you die, one way or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">And this is true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">In the Holocaust this is also true, in business, this true everywhere in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">And within bounds of ethics and honor and commitment and service, you just do what’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">And then if you happen to get money for it, well so be it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1402">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1403">ANSWER:  But that’s not the way I make the -- the decisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">That’s not the way to make decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1405">QUESTION:  You know, there’s a Quaker saying, you do good, and do well.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1408">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1410">ANSWER:  So that -- that is really -- I think -- not just Paul Strassmann, this is -- this is bigger than Paul Strassmann, has to do with history of Jews --
QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1411">ANSWER:  -- has to do with preservation, has to do --
QUESTION:  That’s what I was going to ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">It’s not just the Holocaust, it’s really the history of a people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1413">ANSWER:  It’s a -- oh, history of a people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">Jews, when you look at the history of the people, have been extremely successful in survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">They are the oldest survive -- continually survivable civilization and culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">There’s nobody else who goes that far back in a <span class="DLF">line</span> of succession. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">The Egyptians are gone, the Romans are gone, the Greeks are gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">The <span class="REGION">Chinese empire</span> has come and gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">But as a continuum, as a thread, there has be -- there has been a paradigm there that basically says that you -- you -- you -- you diversify. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">You don’t know -- do not get stuck in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Judea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">Sure, you may fight the Romans, but everybody else who fought the Romans and stayed where they were, are gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1422">QUESTION:  And then I was thinking of Eric’s <span class="NPIP">place</span> in that evolution, that you lose some --

<p><span class="sentence" id="1429">QUESTION:  -- fit with the pattern -- I know.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1431">ANSWER:  -- yeah, yeah, just milestones, that’s all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">That’s all they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1433">QUESTION:  Yes. [</span><span class="sentence" id="1434">indecipherable][tape break] There are many other things we haven’t covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1435">ANSWER:  Oh, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">My relationship with the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> goes back to perhaps as early as 1990 -- no, no, no, no, 1988, when -- 1988 when I gave a lecture at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> on -- on the fact that the great lessons of the Slovak no -- uprising was the fact that a Jewish brigade at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camp</span> , marched out as a bat -- armed battalion, as organized battalion and participated as a Jewish organized military unit, although the -- the Jewish brigade in the British army was organized in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tobruk</span> in November of 1944, the Jewish brigade organized in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> as a Jewish unit, goes back to August 29", 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">And I wanted to point out that -- that -- that unit, perhaps, is the first organized Jewish military unit that went to war since A.D. 70. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">There was some interest on the part of the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , but in those days the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> was very much concerned about crying about the enormity of the crime, Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">The idea of fighting, Jews fighting and opposing by action, the actions on the part of the Germans was not high on the agenda, except there was a -- a researcher in the -- in the -- the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , a Dr. Sybil Milton, who got very much interested in the subject, and subsequently, when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , I met with Dr. Milton several times, we had lunch together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">And I tried to convey to you my sense of the Holocaust, namely that this was not necessary some evil maniac plot, but 1t was a historical evolution of a state machinery that went berserk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">In other words, the Nazis and Hitler unleashed the power of the state to its ultimate form of destruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">You know, the state has always done pogroms and done injustice, and done all kinds of things, but here, the superiority of industrial organization and scientific organization, in fact, went to its ultimate conclusion, namely, we are just going to plan, methodically, to destroy people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">And the enormity of the Holocaust really lies in the fact that -- in its engineering. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">In other words, it was planned as an engineer could -- conscious process, where they were actually calculating the capacity of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , the capacity of the killing, how quickly can we burn them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">In other words, they applied scientific management. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">And that is really the grossness, the horror of this thing, which I called the -- the bureaucratization of Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">In other words, the bureaucratization of genocide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">And the point that I was raising was that with advanced information technology, the state can, through control of people, and eliminating privacy in the future, basically grind masses of people to destruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">In other words, endemic in the structure of modern civilization, of industrialization, 1s a capability of massive destruction, by means out of anatomic weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">Sybil Milton was very, very much taken by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">I then subsequently provided to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , a collection of documents which I assembled, my sister actually helped with it, which showed methodically how the various laws were used in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> to gradually strip an innkeeper, who was a veteran from World War I, and who received special license to be an innkeeper and how that was taken away, and this was taken away and the fur coats was taken, and radio was taken, and so on, until you finally got rid of the innkeeper altogether and then gassed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">And I gave a collection of something like 30 documents, where the wife actually got a receipt for the husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">In other words, the bureaucracy worked with perfection and completeness and everything was legitimate and everything was signed and everything was covered by law. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">It was passed by a duly elected parliament. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">And then, of course, Sybil said, yeah, but where do computers come into this thing? </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">And I said, well I don’t know, but when I look at this succession of how Mr. Flak got eliminated, I can see a computerized society doing it much more efficiently, much more expeditiously, without any errors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">Sybil then went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">A month later Sybil calls me up and say, I have something interesting for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">She sends to me in the mail, copies of three pages from some kind of German documentation, which shows a punch card, and shows a picture of what’s called a Hollerith, Deutsche Hollerith machine, and says, could you tell me what it is? </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">And -- and of course I said, surely, this 1s -- this is a machine that is being used, using census data in order to make sure that all the Jews and their property is properly filtered out so that you can schedule the Jews to destruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">And she said, you know, we are building a -- a <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , it’s all crying and weeping, and what have you, but there’s nothing in there about this concept of the grindstone of the bureaucracy actually being an engine of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">And she said, you know, it would be very interesting to be able to prove that the Germans actually used computers in tabulating mach -- she didn’t distinguish between tabulating machine and -- and I said, yeah, that would be very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">I took the picture and send it to a friend of mine who 1s a retired IBM executive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">She said, oh we tried it before, we asked IBM whether they had anything to do with providing tabulating machine to the Nazis, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">I said, Sybil, you must be kidding, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">So I send it to this guy in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> , he’s retired, he looks at it, he says, oh, this is Dehomag number 325, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">And yeah, the card says so and so Jew, and property and location and he’s accounted for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">So Sybil says, you know what, we really would need this kind of thing on the exhibit in order to make the point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">Could you get the Nazi machine? </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">I said, you must be kidding, you know, there’s no such thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">Well, try anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">So I sent out, because of my many connection -- you know, I am a collector, you know, you saw that --
QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1473">ANSWER:  -- I collect some stuff, you know that -- I love to go and look for things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">And someday I’m going to tell you some of the stuff that I was able to find. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">I mean, really, I have a story behind each. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">See, I collected every item in here, I bought and collected.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1477">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">And we should say that’s the <span class="BUILDING">IBM museum</span> of -- w-we should explain to them, anyways.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1481">ANSWER:  -- Xerox Historical Museum of the Written Word. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">Well at any rate, I sent out a -- a letter saying -- to all the <span class="BUILDING">computer museums</span> in the world, and there are four, you know, do you have a Dehomag number 302? </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">Oh no, we haven’t got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">I said, well, if you find wa -- one of them, we really need it for a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , could you -- could you let me know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">Well, the <span class="DLF">Berlin wall</span> falls, three weeks later I get a phone call from the <span class="BUILDING">British museum</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">engineering museum</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> on -- on -- on -- on -- next to the <span class="BUILDING">Imperial Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">And they said, you know, somebody’s offered us for sale, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> , a Dehomag 302. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">I said, fine, can we buy it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">Well, you know, they -- they just -- they -- they -- they really would like to sell it for 2,000 dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">I say, go buy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">Well, then I go to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , oh, you know, this -- we -- how do we know it’s authentic, what is this and this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">I said, 2,000 bucks guys, be real. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">Then they had to send somebody to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to look at the machine, they didn’t know anything about the machine, they come back, yeah, there is such a machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">It -- actually the <span class="DLF">air</span> ca -- air -- th-the expense for -- was more than the machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">Well, finally they buy the machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">The machine is shipped to the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> where all of this stuff was being staged prior to being -- to completion of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">This is before the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">They invite me to come to authenticate the machine, and of course my friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> tells me what to look at, what serial number and all of those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">I go and look at -- it’s a gorgeous machine, just gor -- you know, only the Germans can make this fine machine parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">It was a tabulator, it was a sorter, it was an input machine, the whole thing, whole shooting thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">I said, you know, this is -- this 1s just a beautiful thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">Well, would you please write something? </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">So I wrote a script for the -- for the -- for the -- for the display unit, called the bureaucratization of genocide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">Well, it didn't go over very well with the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">They ultimately put the three machines on the exhibit, but they were taking too much <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , so last time I know, they removed two of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">I find -- I have a real bad feeling about the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , I just want you to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">Many of the people who are the biggest donor to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museums</span> are Jews who are survivors, who came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , made lots of money and are heavily funding the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">You know, this is -- this is their guilt trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">I -- you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1509">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1510">ANSWER:  Now I -- I may be overdoing it, but they really did not want to take it from the fact it’s a crime to something that I see, it is something which has much broader consequence for the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">And when you are telling kids about the Holocaust -- well they say, well Hitler was a bad guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">Well, when -- when do we gonna get another Hitler? </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">You know, it’s all the Nazis and the Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1514">QUESTION:  Ah, but the mission is, you know, it’s a government insti -- funded institution to educate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1515">ANSWER:  They don’t educate, in my view, and I been to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> twice, I spoke there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">I look at -- I -- I ge -- I’m on the mailing list and so forth, and I listen to Elie Wiesel -- Elie Wiesel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">The education in the information age is to beware of the abrogation of civil liberties, of the use of computers in the police system --
QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1518">ANSWER:  -- which can be perverted, and that I don’t see as a theme emerging from the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">They don’t want to touch it with a 10 foot pole.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1520">QUESTION:  They want to keep, you feel, to the narrower.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1521">ANSWER:  Yeah, they want to keep it as a feeling, well this is bad, this is bunch of bad guys, and all of those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">To me it is much more endemic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">It’s -- it’s the -- the state going mad, like in Pol Pot’s time, I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">Like under Mao.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1525">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">Oh, which conceivably can happen to any society at any time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1527">ANSWER:  Can happen to any society, any time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1528">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1529">ANSWER:  And that moral lesson is not visible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">And you might as well tell your sponsors that, that I said so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">Had to get it off my chest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1532">QUESTION:  You had something further to add.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1533">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">There was no way -- ma -- this is my commentary on the tenor and the morality of the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , and the lessons to the history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">And one of the very significant lessons of bureaucratization of genocide is the extremely small staff that Eichmann had in order to execute massive amount of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">Eichmann and his people, in a typical German fashion, were methodical bureaucrats first. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">So when Arons -- Ar-Arons says about the banality of -- of -- of -- of the crime, he -- she really does not get into the analytic mech -- mechanism of how this 1s done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">It was done, and I’ve studied it, in a very organized, methodical method which leveraged the machinery of the state, of the police, of the [indecipherable] of the judicial system, to commit the crime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">When you really look at it from a legal standpoint, there was no crime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">Duly elected --

QUESTION:  United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">This is an interview with Paul Strassmann, conducted by Margaret West, on January the 8, 2004, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Canaan</span> , <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">This interview is part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s post-Holocaust interview project, and is a follow up July the 11", 1990. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">This is tape number four, side A. Nothing -- you’re saying that nothing illegal --
ANSWER:  Well, the --
QUESTION:  -- had occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1546">ANSWER:  -- the Holocaust, at least the way I witnessed it, with the evidence available to me, although there were exceptions, particularly in the <span class="REGION">conquered lands</span> , where in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , in -- where there was no legality at all, it was -- th-that was just plunder and mur-murder and what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">But I’m talking about <span class="REGION">western Europe</span> , so-called civilized <span class="REGION">western Europe</span> , which includes our good friends the French, and -- and -- and the Belgians, and the Germans and particularly the Austrian and the Slovaks, and the Hungarians and the Romanian, etcetera, etcetera, all did that in a very methodical, prescribed, legitimate method, which means that they could argue that they were proceeding through the sovereign rights of the state to take measures which they considered necessary to defend their social and economic well being. </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">By the way, that argument has been made. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">Now, with that structure, and then harnessing the power of the state, they were then able to execute a crime in a very well structured method, which took advantage of all the best managerial know-how, such as being taught in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> today, of management. </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">In fact, people get MBAs in subjects which are closely related to that, except they apply to cattle and apply to krispies, and hamburgers and what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">Now, the evidence for this thing really is in what’s called a transaction cost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">The transaction costs for executing this crime were very low, because this was largely self funding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">For instance, the Slovak paid the Germans, as you know, 10 marks for every body for resettlement and reeducation fees. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">The confiscations were self funding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">Eichmann actually produced a profit and loss statement, because through the confiscation and so forth, they were able to get a large amount of gold into the coffers of their Reich system, although sooner or later the corruption crept in, but nevertheless, it was run as a business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">The business was based on the fact that a very small number of people at <span class="BUILDING">corporate headquarters</span> , with some enforcement, could take care of problems which involved the marshalling and destruction of millions of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">And one of the key elements in that process was the utilization of the Jewish organizations in co-opting the Jewish organizations into the liquidation process. </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">The deportation lists from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span> , that I used to trace the authenticity of who was a victim or not, were made by the Jewish [indecipherable], by the Jewish organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">The supervision and the guidance of, you know, going to this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and going to this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , was done mostly by Jews with the enforcers onlooking except when there were some hooligans who did some stupid things, you know, like beat up people and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">But most of it was done in a fairly organized fashion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">So now comes the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , and you have a list of Holocaust survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">And then you have a list of Holocaust survivor donors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">And then you have interviews with these donors who are being awarded this or that, and being treated to this or that dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">And then you have the Los Angeles chapter, and then you have the New York chapter, etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">Well, these people get up and make a speech and they say how they suffered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and in what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">Now it turns out that none of them ever give away when they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">None of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">They never do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">This is one thing -- by the -- in many of my inquiries, and I will tell you some stories also how this [indecipherable] -- many of these people, by innuendo and implication esp- espe -- especially as to the date of the way, how the destruction was done, are clearly 1942 inmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">Now please tell me --
QUESTION:  Oh, because based on putting together information from what they’ve said?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1571">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">Please tell me how can anybody survive <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> from ’42 to --
QUESTION:  Liberation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1573">ANSWER:  -- the spring -- to liberation, which is early spring of 1945, without being a kapo? </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">So the money they’re giving is guilt money, it’s tainted money, it’s immoral money, it’s bad money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">And they influence the -- the tenor of what I see -- I haven’t been to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> now for about seven years, maybe they changed the exhibits. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">But it is -- the morality, you see, the morality of that thing, which is really the underlying issue and the guidance for people to think about the future is not obvious, or not apparent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">It’s not even discussed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">Now, the morality of course, is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad Vashem</span> , where they have the Righteous, and th-that’s a different thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">But to me the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> is --
QUESTION:  Well, that’s also part of the story told at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , is the Righteous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1580">ANSWER:  But without the morality, that’s --
QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1581">ANSWER:  -- individual -- you see -- see -- see --
QUESTION:  I do see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1582">ANSWER:  You see, that gets you into individual psychology of individual people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">When you are going to teach about the Holocaust, children, and if you’re looking into the information society of the 21%‘ and 22 century -- you know, those <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> has ways of staying around for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1584">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1585">ANSWER:  Something that 1s the guts of the issue, in terms of relevance to the future is not there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1586">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">And -- and of course, all the time, life goes on and other events take place, such as the Bosnian war, which also comes under the --
ANSWER:  Oh yeah, oh yes, absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1588">QUESTION:  -- teaching message of the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> 
ANSWER:  That’s right, that’s right, e-except the Bosnian war 1s really not analyzed in terms of -- in my terms of reference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">It was again the state machinery -- in this particular case the military machinery, which is the most dangerous machinery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">See, the Germans were much more refined, they never used the military for this purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1591">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1592">ANSWER:  I mean, the Bosnians and the Serbs --
QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1593">ANSWER:  -- were just very crude. </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">I mean, that’s -- that’s -- that’s -- you -- you know, that’s very crude. </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">Now --
QUESTION:  Yes, I see the distinction.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1596">ANSWER:  And -- and those are very important, you see, the taxonomy of genocide varies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">You have a Mao Tse-Tung, very sophisticated, harnessing the young pioneers to engage in genocide, but actually mobilizing a section of the communist party to execute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">Then you have Pol Pot, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1599">Then you have the very interesting situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1600">There is a whole taxonomy of different forms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1601">There is a life form out there called genocide, that has a set of indicators which should be used as an way of alerting society, so that society can distinguish it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">See, one of -- part of the problem with the genocide was that the society in ’38 - °39 did not discriminate, did not distinguish it, and the Jewish organizations were used as way of distorting and not clarifying what was really happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1603">We knew, for instance, what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was, what [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1604">The Jewish -- we had two people come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and
QUESTION:  To your --
ANSWER:  To <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1605">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1606">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1607">So that was known at the end of 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="1608">Had that been known and broadcast by the Jewish community, more Jews would have taken a different view. </span><span class="sentence" id="1609">They didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1610">The thing was hushed up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1611">QUESTION:  Why’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1612">ANSWER:  Don’t rock the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1613">Keep low. </span><span class="sentence" id="1614">You might offend somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1615">So, you know, if you really want to listen to Paul Strassmann, my lesson for the Holocaust, I mean, there’s a whole different story to be told, in terms of its real events, to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1616">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1617">ANSWER:  But I’m not sure they want to hear it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1618">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">Well, we’ve -- this is a small way of making sure the story 1s there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1620">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1621">QUESTION:  In their -- in the archives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1622">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1623">The whole taxonomy, structure and dynamics of the Holocaust has to deal with going back to options. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">I-I wrote a paper and gave a series of lectures which were very 0 -- people were very unhappy about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">I pointed out that in 1944, the probability of surviving the eight month remaining for the remainder of the war, much greater if you fought than if you went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1626">In other words, there were two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sered</span> , one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novaky</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">The one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novaky</span> marched a battalion with a survival rate of 70 percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1628"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sered</span> was done -- run by religious Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">Well, maybe we’ll negotiate our way, maybe it’s not there, maybe we don’t go on this transfer, maybe we’ll go to the next transfer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">Always bargaining. </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">See, you were bargaining, see the -- you were bargaining with evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1632">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1633">ANSWER:  The bargaining with evil. </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">There comes a point where you don’t bargain with evil, you see, because you are out of choices. </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">Because the evil will not give you any choices. </span><span class="sentence" id="1636">And so the probability, the morbidity rate of those was 95 percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">So you know, you’re now dealing with statistics and with odds, and with orientation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1638">You know, you had six million Jews with lots of money in 1938, let’s go and take a hike. </span><span class="sentence" id="1639">You know, we could have gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Madagascar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1640">We could have gone to all kinds of other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1641">Again, I am talking about the survival rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1642">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1643">Well, it’s very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1644">And --
