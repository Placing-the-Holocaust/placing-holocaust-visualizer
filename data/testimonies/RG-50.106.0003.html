<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  June 23rd, 1921.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit about your family, who made up your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  It was a very small family. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I was a only child. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My father then already came back from two years of World War I in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and after that two years as POW. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My mother was from the other part of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and they got married right after World War I where the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was split between two parts, Communist part and a non-Communist part. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And they had to start all over after that again. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">But they had been very successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">My father as a businessman was very, very well off.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  What kind of business was he in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  They had men clothing which entailed tailoring which entailed upper coats and suits of every fashion. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Not [haphhazard ?] </span><span class="sentence" id="17">like here. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">That was the <span class="DLF">line</span> of my first husband'sfamily. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">But they were strictly men clothing and they were three partners to it, three young men who learned the trade together and at the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> and became very good in the trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  Would you describe your family as upper class or middle class?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  Middle class, and my father was really a self-made man. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">He was the son of a [sem?] </span><span class="sentence" id="23">religious teacher who had a lot of children and constantly moving on from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other where there were enough Jewish boys to teach and prepare. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So while my father was the oldest boy, he went out and had no chance of education, formal education, but he was working only that his younger brothers all should have and he was able to give that to them and was always [shortening?] </span><span class="sentence" id="25">the whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Not that it meant too much of a- how should I say -- really not miss anything because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">It was different in my mother's parents' case. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">My mother's parents were the richest wholesalers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Watz</span> [ph] where they lived, which changed drastically in the 1930s when my mother's sister married a man who ruined the families, so much so that they left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and moved up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and didn't want to be seen and known by nobody that they are having financial problems they didn't have because their sons and daughters made sure that they should not miss anything, but, of course, they were not in the way they used to be and they were suffering -- they were ashamed not to live the life what originally was meant to be lived by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  Can you describe the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that you lived in? </span><span class="sentence" id="30">How big was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="31">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miskolec</span> [ph] is the capital of <span class="REGION">Northern Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">It's a big well, well run place which had a lot of <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> around it. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So business was always a capital place where people came from the whole surrounding. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And it had over 10,000 Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  Out of -- do you know what the overall population --
ANSWER:  It was 60,000 population, which came -- became later 100,000 with the outer parts growing into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">The -- the Jewish community had different <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> , from orthodox to where the rabbi only spoke Yiddish, to another one which had a rabbi who had the doctorate and spoke Hungarian, and the third one which was so religious a small-town religious like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southmar</span> [ph] is and they lived separately in their own little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> within it. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Within the --
QUESTION:  Did you have a large extended family in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  My father's family lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">He had sisters and brothers and, of course, the sisters' and brothers’ children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  Did you get together with the family on holidays and --
ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">But yes, of course, we went to visit them in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Yes, we met them time to time. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Of course we went to visit at their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">But it was not a close relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">My mother and her in-laws were just fine but in a cool way. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">It never warmed up to a level where they were really fine with their family, and so, of course, I was not part of the family there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  How religious was your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="49">What kind of religious background did you have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  We had strictly <span class="BUILDING">orthodox kosher house</span> , but it was mainly to in respect of the parents who wouldn't have eaten otherwise at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And then I was 17 and both of my setof grandparents died within a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">After that it was still kosher because they were used to having their ways, but it was no such thing anymore that I couldn't bring into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> something what before couldn't be brought in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Did you celebrate holidays, --
ANSWER:  Oh, sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  -- religious holidays and --
ANSWER:  Oh, sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  -- observe Shabbat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Well, observe Shabbat, yes, but my father's <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was open. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">It wasn't open only on [shoppershu] and the three days of the high holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Yes, my --
QUESTION:  Did you go to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Did you have any religious training?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  There was -- there was in -- not <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> , but in the regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where we went we had a teacher come in and give us twice-a-week religious lessons which was not taken too seriously, neither by the congregation to send a proper teacher, nor the children who, of course, went as much for it as the families went for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">But it was more than the American children had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  What kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did you go to? </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Was this a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  No, none was <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I first -- <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish elementary</span> , which was huge. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">It was for 1,000 children, which meant up to six grades they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I went there four grades and from there I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Protestant gimnazium</span> because that was the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">The Jewish children had to pay double of thequarter. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">The Catholics one-and-a-half times only. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But we were different, definitely different, but we were allowed to go at least.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  What -- what part of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was Jewish, do you remember, approximately?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  Well, it depended on classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  My class, out of the 50 we had 18 Jewish girls and we were fighting because by the time we grew -- we were growing into first [Jewish low Hitler] and some girls in the summer went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> others had the Nazis of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> with rings on their hand and we were fighting fistfights with them. [</span><span class="sentence" id="76">They have -- with their debt].</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Mm-hmm. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Um, what about your friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Did you have --
ANSWER:  The friends were Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  Were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  Not true, because I did have one or two non-Jewish friends, but they were not that close because the children could have been very close and we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together and everything was fine, but the parents of that group did not really want their daughters to mix so much with the Jews, so we were not kept very close with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  Did you live in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  So it was a mixed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  It's a very mixed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  Was there any problem in the early -- obviously we'll get to the '30s later on, but in the beginning was there -- do you recall any problem? </span><span class="sentence" id="87">A: No, there was not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  (Inaudible) -- child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  Actually there was no problem where we lived until 1944 when they pushed us in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettoes</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And did you have any hobbies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  Oh, God knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I wouldn't have called it hobbies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  Other interests besides <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  I believe that my life is depending on that we go to the Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I was a sports person and yes, I was prepared for the 1936 Olympics and Hitler didn't want me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  In what sport?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  Gymnastics.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  Gymnastics. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So you took that very seriously?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Very, very seriously, and I was very talented too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  And you had -- did you have private instruction?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  No, but I belonged to a sport club of which teacher was my teacher at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , too, so we were just going into that and get all the meets what sportsmen have right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">We had sports clubs there. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We had <span class="DLF">training grounds</span> there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  And you thought -- and it was thought that you were good enough to possibly qualify for the --
ANSWER:  I was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  That high? </span><span class="sentence" id="108">A: Was expected that I will qualify for the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , the academic that I would be going there, but, of course, Jew couldn't go there by the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  But you were of the caliber to be able to compete. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Um, what -- did you belong to any youth groups?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Yes, but it was unorthodox way because the Girl Scouts were not supposed to have Jews, but the Girl Scout leader, the teacher leader, wanted me to go along with them because I was so good and I was ready to pull the kids up if they had difficulty going up on a <span class="DLF">mountainside</span> , so I was with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  So you were a member of the non -- the Girl Scouts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  An unofficial member, because officially I couldn't be. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">A Jew couldn't be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  And how did you -- you were a young girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">How did you feel about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Did that bother you --
ANSWER:  Probably.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  -- that unofficially --
ANSWER:  Probably didn't even realize that that's holding me back from anything, because it didn't hold me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">It was probably more showing that my friends are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish communities</span> and not there, but I was really comfortable until I -- I was part of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Did you belong to any Zionist youth groups?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">There was one, and I don't know why, but they were only boys, men, and there was a tennis club which was Zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">We went sometimes to play on their <span class="DLF">courts</span> , but that was a (inaudible). </span><span class="sentence" id="127">We belonged to them as friends but we never part of the -- as a organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Pardon me. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Q: Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">It's 1933 and Hitler has come into power. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">You were only 12, so you were young. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Did you -- were you or your parents aware of situations changing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  I have in my memory a picture what I will never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">My father sitting on the side of his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> going to sleep and on eleven o'clock the evening when the radio came through that Hitler became --
QUESTION:  Chancellor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  -- the chancellor, and I can hear his voice clearly: "That's the end for us." </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And that memory is so clear in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I can see him in his underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">This is the nightshirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Clearly, clearly see him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Did he talk to you about this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  He made this as a statement to my mother and me as we were listening to the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Came through and --

QUESTION:  Not at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  Not at that early age, but later when I was listening to his tirades.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  On the radio?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  On the radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  How did that make you feel? </span><span class="sentence" id="152">A: Sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Sick in the stomach. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And we kept wondering, how can these people believe in that? </span><span class="sentence" id="155">How can they go with him so blindly? </span><span class="sentence" id="156">But -- the only thing was, you know, that we thought that we are so embedded Hungarians that nothing can come to us and nothing can hurt us, and awful for all these people who are bothered by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">But it cannot happen to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  What languages did you speak?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  I started to speak German before I spoke Hungarian because my father felt that a person is as many persons as languages he speaks. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So they spoke to me in German only until I was five. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Of course I understood in the meantime Hungarian because we had a maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">We had this coming to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , that coming to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but they weren't talking to me in Hungarian until I was five, so by the time I go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I should be really good by children and I should speak that language too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  And your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was taught in Hungarian’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Although the second grade we speak -- picked up German and then, of course, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">gimnazium</span> we picked up right away German as first grade, and the third grade French, and I had also private instruction by then in French, and at 16 I started to learn English, British English, and in the meantime I had Latin, too, under -- in everything from fifth grade to eighth and we had [???] </span><span class="sentence" id="166">all three languages -- or four languages: Hungarian, German, French and Latin.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  Anything that you specifically remember in the middle '30s that you want to talk about, any specific incidents, or did life just go on --
ANSWER:  Our life went on -- Q: -- in a normal sense?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  -- except that around us there were already ugly happenings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  Such -- that you were aware of?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  A good friend of our son, who right now lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> and he is now 85, 86, was able yet to get to the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debrecen</span> and he may have said something, I don't know anymore how it started, but a boy who -- whose family turned much earlier, so he felt that he is not a Jew, said something of humor, [???] </span><span class="sentence" id="173">and he gave the guy a slap in his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">They threw him off from the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And his father, who was so proud that his son was able to make it, got a heart attack on that account and died. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So, yes, that was quite close. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And yes, the -- by the time we were 15, 16, and started to go with boys who were older than us and they couldn't go to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> or they were in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> , and that was a lesser degree school than the other <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">They already had problems and the first Jewish laws started to come in effect in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">It was already time when a lot of this was -- had to let go from <span class="BUILDING">companies</span> because it had to be just a percentage of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And from there on it was coming closer and closer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  How was your father's business affected in 1938?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  In '38, not yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  Mm-hmm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  But by 1940, '41 it was affected. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">They did not get all the merchandise they wanted to buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Not everybody was allowed to sell, and once the war broke out, it was a goodexcuse why they are excluding some but why is less merchandise available, so the Jews should be getting less. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">The real problems came in 1942 when -- in 1940, first my father was to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> , but that was a very minor and --
QUESTION:  We'll talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I just want to go a little bit chronologically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">QUESTION:  Were you aware of Kristallnacht?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">ANSWER:  Most probably, yes, but I cannot now tell you when I --
QUESTION:  Heard about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  When and how.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  Mm-hmm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  But it was with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I knew about it later. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">But again, it was something awful happening somewhere very far. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">The closer the more vivid, tragic effects came when Hitler came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and the Viennese Jews, who were original from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , tried to come back and came back in droves and were telling us what's happening there and -- or so they couldn't go back.</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="1309">And we didn't like their food but now we started to be strong enough to have opinion about food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">Andwe lived there until August. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">The American soldiers were not allowed to mix with Germans, with German girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">They couldn't see any. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">They were not allowed to meet the Russian P.O.W.’s so only the Jewish Hungarian refugees were partners for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">So they were allowed to make dances and invite us to go to dances. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">And of course that meant that we made friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">And they brought the cigarette and brought some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">And they had resting groups close to the outskirt of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frielendorf</span> where they could go to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">And on the <span class="DLF">beach</span> there was no one allowed to go with them but us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">Not the Germans, not who lived there, not nobody but we. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">So there I will have to tell you first a story because this is a good one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">There was a man on the pool side sitting all completely dressed up to his everything on him and was sitting there alone and looking ahead of him and doing nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">And all the rest was enjoying the rest and the sun. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">So it didn't take too long that my friends were pushing me to go and talk to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">It turned out that he was Ralph Kutz from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">He had <span class="BUILDING">gas stations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">When he had to leave his wife <span class="BUILDING">home</span> they had their son the day before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">He was allowed to go to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to see them once and right after that they got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and went over, shipped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">So he didn't have another chance to see his wife and child but that one, that little son of his. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">And he was crying on our shoulder and we were crying on his shoulder which he felt wonderful about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">He never had sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">His mother always wanted to have daughters and never had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">And as we became more and more friends during the summer he kept coming practically daily to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">He came to ask first of all to try to make a Friday night for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">So he brought everything from the PX. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">He brought from the candles fromthe _ everything you name it, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">The soup in the big can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">And we had holiday and we were crying into hishandkerchief so he had to buy handkerchiefs and handkerchiefs and handkerchiefs because we needed lots of handkerchiefs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">And we became so close friends that he was asking me and my camp sister who was in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with me that we should go to be his sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">Go to live with his mother and he will guarantee he will marry us off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">It was awful hard for him to understand that we still hope to see our husbands so we will go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and not straight to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">And then from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> I wrote him and I got married to Andy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">Probably not even then but right after that when I was already pregnant and yes and I asked him if they had any of the baby things left over after that first baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">I will very appreciate because there's practically nothing available here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">Then I didn't hear of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">I knew that in November he went back, he gave address and what not and that's where we wrote. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">And we also sent a picture my girlfriend and me two of us a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">But that was later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">Because that ended everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">The package what came in was this large. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">I was seven months pregnant when that arrived one morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">It was some 80 pounds, huge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">There was one piece on the top of it what was a huge piece which was kind of christening outfit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">All the rest was packed in a <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">And the <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> 's paper was put on the top of it and they wished well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">They sent me a robe, they sent me slippers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">And we sent this picture to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">And by then he wrote of another baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">They have the second one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">So Andy and I where we started to physically be in better shape we bought something but we thought it's a nice gift item and we had mailed two of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">One to his mother, and one to his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">Not ever since then I got a word from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">Either they got hurt that I want to pay back what they did or God knows what now I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">Or the wife became jealous because seeing our pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">Now weturned around from what Ralph had seen and I can very well imagine that she did not like that friendship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">And since we are not going to become his sisters, I got married and my girlfriend got married the same time, same day under the same __ and we did not go to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">But the man there on that pool side fully dressed because he's an Orthodox Jew he wouldn't get undressed.</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="1559">and asked our friends who lived there how to go out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">I still to this day I don't know how he knew, who mentioned that in front of him, or who else told him because we certainly did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">I couldn't imagine that I can hurt my child with pain like that I shall be telling all these what I was telling you or even more to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">I wanted to save him from that forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">I just couldn't bring myself to talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">The first timeI was talking about all that was in 1990 we were sitting in front of the <span class="INT_SPACE">operating room</span> and his father was operated on at <span class="BUILDING">Georgetown University Hospital</span> where I first talked to him about where I'd been. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">He came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> once earlier and said I belong to the second generation and they are encouraging us to ask you to give us oral history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">And I jumped up from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> where I was sitting I run out to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and he knew that he cannot ask me again about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">It's been much later in the ‘70s sometimes when I first was able to talk to non-Jewish people mentioning where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">I kind of it just came out of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">It was I don't know what I wanted to do with them if I wanted to scare them or what I wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">But I couldn't say that to anybody who was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">I just didn't want to talk about it at all to Jewish people for years and years and years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">And when they were talking about the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> my husband and I were both dead set against it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">I couldn’t see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">I still cannot understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">I still feel to a certain degree that this is guilt money from the American government and from the American Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">They all feel much easier to put the moneys into something than their hearts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">And we will be always different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">We cannot be understood by the Americans, and the Americans cannot be understood by us totally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">I still have that bitterness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">My -- I had a boss in the end of the ‘50s whose family also perished there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">And says to me Suzanne you will have to tell me how my relatives perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">So at lunchtime when he was sitting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">switchboard</span> and I was brown- bagging my lunch and was eating at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> he said tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">And so I started to tell him that ?</span><span class="sentence" id="1584">Mr. Rosengarden? </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">I don't know I didn't know your relatives so I don't know how they, I only can tell you what was the average. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">And I started to tell him and in three or four minutes he stopped me he said Suzanne don't say that it hurts too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">And I thinkthis is what any American Jew feels. </span><span class="sentence" id="1588">I spoke to quite a few just lately who said they don't want to go down to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">They don't want to see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">And they don't know nothing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">There is a lady here who I appreciate very much as an intelligent, deep feeling, good person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">A few months ago in somehow it came to me that she was asking about how Andy lost his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">And I said well how, she had ?</span><span class="sentence" id="1594">Steve? </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">on her arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">She looked at me and I said don't you know that everyone who went there with child perished? </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">No, I didn't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">And I became so very, very angry on that that I wanted to organize a seminar here that a few people who I know were survivors should talk to these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1599">I don't want them to hear all the most awful things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1600">I'm ready to tell them some story which probably makes them even smile sometime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1601">But they should know some of the feelings we went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">They don't want to know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1603">So that's all I can tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1604">Iam not a good person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">I am still angry.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1623">QUESTION:  You had talked earlier about how devastated you were about what happened to your mother and this other person helped you, looked out for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">After that what kept you going? </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">What do you think kept you going through this terrible, terrible time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1626">ANSWER:  There's only one thing I can tell you, what I told the people around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">I was trying to keep them alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">I kept telling them that think about it as a badly administered | excursion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">We were through with it, we will get through with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">It's just ugly and we have to be in it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">But we will get out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1632">And I did believe that if you let yourself go, you cannot live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1633">And the only way to do it is if you keep yourself clean and clean and clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">Wash as much as you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">Clean as much as you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1636">That's the only thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">It's not eating, it's cleanliness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1638">Because once you get lice you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1639">In our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was the outskirts I mean the outer-lager of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> we had this little lady, the rabbi's wife, she kept on her head a turban constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1640">Never removed it, never washed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1641">It was full with lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1642">And we just decided that we won’t get in danger because of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1643">And we decided she was never out working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1644">She never came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1645">Somehow, I don't know how, she managed that she never had to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1646">And we decided in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that we are going to take <span class="BUILDING">home</span> some what’s the, it’s a fluid what you clean with, petrol. </span><span class="sentence" id="1647">Petrol from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and we will wash her head with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1648">And we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1649">And we threw away her turban and she was screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1650">And she thought about it and we got another turban for her and we washed her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1651">Now that's the only, only, only way you could stay alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1652">And what kept you alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1653">And of course I had my aunt there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1654">Not that I loved her so dearly,but she was still the sister of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1655">So you wanted to take care of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">You wanted to bring her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">And I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1658">QUESTION:  Did you form any close friendships with people, not your relatives, but new --
ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1659">There were two ladies, who I became very close friend of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1660">The one I mention to you as a lager-sister who got married the same day I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1661">And she lived in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> until she got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1662">And another one who was a her husband and family had a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miskolc</span> and she was -- she was a strange lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="1663">She was not well educated but she had such a smooth way of being friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1664">Probably she was too feminine to that I would today think about her that I want her for friend, and I would have rather second thought that probably she was lesbian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1665">She was that kind of lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="1666">But then she was very good to be a friend there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">We were carrying the bombs together and we were remembering old songs, old poems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1668">We had to use our praise, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1669">That was also very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">We were trying the —_s~ whatever we needed to remember things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1671">And she was good for that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1673">ANSWER:  That bitter almond. </span><span class="sentence" id="1674">There’s a drink which 1s made of an almond flavor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1675">I can't take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1676">And of course I never learned how to wash something clean white. </span><span class="sentence" id="1677">Everything becomes gray in my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1678">And I was washing there and all my fingers were bleeding but I couldn't make it white. </span><span class="sentence" id="1679">There are two things my mother never made me learn around the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> to wash an item. </span><span class="sentence" id="1680">She said for that you always will have somebody do it for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1681">How wrong she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1682">But everything else she wanted me to know how to give orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1683">She said you cannot give orders unless you knew how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1684">And she always expected me to just to be ready to give orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1685">Q: Do you get reparations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1686">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1687">I got a very little in the late 50's or early 60's. </span><span class="sentence" id="1688">A minimal amount was given and since then whenever I asked I was negated fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="1689">There was no words of something somebody was telling us that there is something being now given. </span><span class="sentence" id="1690">But I didn't even go to make a telephone call to ask about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1691">I'm not interested anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1692">It hurts too much when they say oh you don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1693">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="1694">Because again still the Germans are deciding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1695">And then there's always a group of Jews who are serving them very well, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1696">Just like they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> when the Germans came in and the Jews were congregations giving out names, giving out who is the rich out of them, you name it, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1697">They gave the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue buildings</span> for them to horde all the goods, the silvers, and the golds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1698">There always will be Jews who are serving the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1699">They usually will be Germans Jews though.</span></p>
