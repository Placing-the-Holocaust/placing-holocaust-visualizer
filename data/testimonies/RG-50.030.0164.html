<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  I'd like you tell me a few words about your childhood and to tell me something about your family when you were a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  My parents...my father was a guitar player, used to play in different <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">As a child I had to learn how to play the violin because I had to help my family, and my mother, my mother wasn't working and we only lived from what my dad used to bring <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so I also used to accompany my dad in <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> and play so we could support our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">When I was a little older, I left...1 didn't play with my dad any longer and I started playing with another younger chap and we played in <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And I played the violin.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  Where did you learn how to play violin and where did you go through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  Did you have any problems with children in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> or did you get along with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Around my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , everybody were our people. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">We used to play together and we were friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">We did really not have many problems as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">No, not at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Mr. Moise, tell me a little bit about what happened with you and with your family when the war started? </span><span class="sentence" id="17">What did the war mean for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  The beginning of the war...first of all, I could no longer make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">All the <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> closed down and I had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I could play. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I had to work to find different jobs, jobs which I didn't really know how to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">For instance, to work in a all kinds of agricultural work that I was not really qualified for, but I could at least make a living and I think till the war crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">The troops went on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> during the beginning of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">In the beginning of 1942 and by that time a few more <span class="BUILDING">taverns</span> opened up and I could at that time still find a few jobs playing the violin, so at that time I could still make a few bucks that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  When did you get married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  I got married in the beginning of February 1942, after my parents died. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">My dad died in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">My mother died right afterwards in January '42, a year later. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I was left alone with my sister and I had to go make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I didn't know what to do with my little sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I used to leave her with the neighbors but still when I took her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , she told me that they had beaten her up, they didn't feed her even if I did pay for her keep and they kept her for a night or several nights, I used to pay them to keep her until I returned from my work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  How old was the little girl?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  She was six years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Maybe five, six. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And she used to complain about it...they're beating me up, they didn't feed me, they scream at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And the neighbors told me that since I was eighteen years old, look for a girl, get married, so your wife would take care of your and you should care for your sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">There's no other solution. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">For sure you will not be able to get by yourself because your brothers are gone but you have no relatives to help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Nobody will help you, so get married and then your wife will take care of you and of your sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So in the beginning of February I found some really nice people who are the parents of my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Somebody took me there and we agreed and we got married and indeed when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , at that time we didn't have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radiators</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">It was a private <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">We used to heat it with wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I used to put the lights on, and I used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and find food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , a little heat. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">My sister was taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Somebody was there to take care of my sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  What happened afterwards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  So later I used to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I used to make a living because I had a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where I lived with my wife and my sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  Just keep talking about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  Shall I tell you directly about the war?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  And who accompanied you from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">commissary</span> and to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  The police. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">The police. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">At the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was also guarded by the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Probably it must have been pre-arranged because there were policemen when we came into the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Maybe it was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or a former <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ...I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So anyway, all night long until in the morning, they kept bringing in people from Iasi, gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">At a certain point they used to call our name and take us to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> and they used to take information...ask us information about our address, the parents, where I was born...so anyway they filled up all kinds of forms. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">There were many many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And we stayed there maybe about two days, until they finished the forms for all the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">After everything was done, they formed small groups and they took us to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> in . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">There there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> waiting for us, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> , empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">They were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We had to climb into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We were too many of us in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">At least we were very crowded which found our little <span class="NPIP">place</span> and we stayed in these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> maybe another day, one night, in the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> until they brought other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> from other parts of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , also a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> full of gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">They attached those newly arrived <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> to ours and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> left. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Whenever train stops we were allowed to get out just for our basic needs. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">They would occasionally open the <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">We could get off, just for a little time and we kept going until we crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River</span> , but it took a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Then we crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River</span> and even then they would open the <span class="DLF">door</span> at times so we could go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Maybe they gave us some water too...and then we crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River</span> and we arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Whenever the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would stop, we arrived at the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we could see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> (ph), not close by but far away, at least different uh suburbs of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">On the left, so that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was on the right on a <span class="DLF">secondary rail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">In front of us were some military people, some soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">The soldiers were not doing anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">They did not have any kind of military exercises. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">They just stayed there doing nothing and there were some <span class="DLF">ditches</span> near them, and the soldiers, they...we stayed in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and we stayed there from morning...I don't know exactly what time, but we stayed there until evening, maybe three, four, five in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">The soldiers did not leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">They received food. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">We saw that because there was a right in front. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">They just stayed without doing anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">As soon as the mechanic engineer of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> gave the signal for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to leave, we boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again and we saw that the soldiers left as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  Who used to guard the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  The soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They were soldiers, dressed in khaki uniforms.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  What happened later?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  We went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I don't remember all the names of the <span class="BUILDING">train stations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">After <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> we were closed into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We couldn't see any names. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">When we arrived at ; there we all had...many of us had to get out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we had to march in a column to the small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that would go, not . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Probably it continued to . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It was not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that could climb <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> there, but they brought some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> and they took some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> , some old women and children, and put them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> , but not many of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Most of us had to walk and we walked and we walked from morning till late, late at night, maybe until around one in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We marched on without any food, any water, just a few stops along the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And so we walked maybe till one, one thirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We used to stop...then we stopped on the right and on the left sides of the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and we rested until morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Maybe they were afraid that since it was dark, we would run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">So we slept along side the <span class="DLF">road</span> and in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> until morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">In the morning we started again, and we marched and marched and around two in the afternoon we arrived at this <span class="DLF">farm</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Petrosky</span> (ph)...
QUESTION:  I would like to ask you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Tell me how were the conditions during the march?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  Was it police or gendarmes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  They were gendarmes or military people. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">They were dressed in costumes (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="123">There were many, many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Sometimes you'd rest and there were many who would come from behind, from the back of the column. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">How shall I say...they would rush to come so they could rest for a longer time because those who were at the beginning, at the head of the column, would rest a little longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">The ones in the back, until they arrive to sit down, then we had to start all over again, so all these people from the back would come to sit with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">They told us there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> with a rifle behind us, so we guarded on the right, on the left by these sentinels but there was an armed cart behind us, and we arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Petrosky</span> , so...
QUESTION:  Excuse me all the time interrupting you, but on this <span class="DLF">road</span> , you are thirsty, you are hungry...
ANSWER:  Don't even mention that. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We were just about bursting. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">It was September which is very hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">The sun was burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We would go by <span class="DLF">wells</span> , by running water, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">brooks</span> , <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> ...we were not allowed to stop to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We were not allowed to drink anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Not even a drop of water till we arrived in and no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">No food. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Petrosky</span> and there when we arrived, there was a full of water from where the cattle would drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">We filled ourselves on this <span class="DLF">well</span> and drank some water. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">We were left out there in the <span class="DLF">field</span> and we no longer saw any soldiers or no one whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">We were just left alone without any guards, no one to talk to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  What did they tell you before they left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">They just left, left us there alone without telling us anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We just stayed on this <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">On the right there was a <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> or a <span class="DLF">stone mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">There were some <span class="DLF">pits</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">How should I call them...pits, you know, <span class="DLF">stone pits</span> , no longer in use, so all we could see was the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you see, open <span class="DLF">pits</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And we just stayed there on the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">When it rained, we would go down the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And we just stayed there on the <span class="DLF">fields</span> until November. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Some people already started to die off.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  From starvation and diseases. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">The food, two hundred grams of flour, oats flour...
QUESTION:  How were we given this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  They singled out somebody to represent each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , a group of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , a delegate who would represent <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> or another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">They would go this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> nearby and they would bring the flour back and he divided it. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We had a box, a tin box like...but the flour was not really processed. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">It was rough. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So he said that each person would get about two hundred grams, which was a full cup of that tin, two hundred grams per person. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">A family that had five people, who'd get five cans _____ and you couldn't really protest. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">You couldn't do much with this flour and occasionally you'd get two or three potatoes too. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">A cup of porridge and potatoes, and that's how we survived, until it being fall, there were <span class="DLF">fields</span> ...they had harvested the <span class="DLF">fields</span> but on the <span class="DLF">field</span> were left some cobs of corn, a few kernels of wheat, and we'd go and pick them up, but we were afraid because if they caught you, nobody...we were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">We would come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So very few of us dared to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So they'd rather die with the family than go out to pick up these leftovers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  Why wouldn't they come back from the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , if they'd go pick them up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  There were these delegates I would call them who were going on these horse-pulled <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggies</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">They were armed. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">They would patrol and if they found you on the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , they would shoot you, or they would take you and you'd never come back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  Were they Romanians or Ukrainians?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  They were not Romanians. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">They were not Romanians, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  And they were in civilian or uniform?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  No, civilian. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And meanwhile as we stayed in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , we were very upset, hungry, full of diseases. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Three men arrived, three young men, and they gathered us there and told us that they came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">They came to send you back to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">We came as a delegation...we have an authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">We received an order from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> to send you back to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , but if you want to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> does not have any money so you must pay your own expenses back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transnistria</span> to whatever your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> is. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Can you imagine that. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Anybody gives the shirts off their back or anything just to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">We didn't have much but whatever we had, we put together and gave it to these young guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">They had some marks with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Whoever had marks or golden earrings from women, wedding bands or maybe nice blankets or whatever special or valuable we had, we gave to these young men. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">They took everything and made a list, and they said wait, that the official delegate and we will come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">We'll go to pay for the transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">We'll come back to pick you up, and you will leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">You will go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , each of you to your own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">You can imagine how happy we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">We waited and waited and waited and never saw them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Not to today. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">They saw everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">They saw how many we were, just about there, and they took the last penny we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">They took the last hope which you just sold for a piece of bread or a potato. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">There was we sold anything for, but anyway...we stayed at this <span class="DLF">farm</span> with our two hundred grams of this flour and nothing else...nothing, nothing else, and occasionally we got these two potatoes per person, and we stayed there until November. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">In late November, other people came and took us to .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  What did they do there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  We found out later they emptied this , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">There were some very good <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> built of stone, good <span class="DLF">roof</span> , good <span class="DLF">fences</span> , very good quality <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> but empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">There was no food in there, no fire, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">When the people evacuated, they took everything with them, so they took us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">There were <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> with two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , with three <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and they packed us in these <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">They were so full that you couldn't even move around. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">All you had <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> is to stretch out to sleep and a little <span class="DLF">path</span> to go out to the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">There were so many ofus __. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And this representative, this delegate who was old and probably he knew more about these things, started to give us this flour again, two grams per head and we stayed there, hoping to be repatriated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> so we stayed there till maybe until February, March, 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And again somebody came to say the order came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> that you go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> , that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were waiting at , at . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">They are waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Again it's cold weather. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Everybody let's go. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">We hardly had anything else with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Everything that we had we sold for potatoes, for bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">We had really nothing, so during the night they took us and we started again marching about two days to return to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">There, you can imagine what happened on these two days on the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">It was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">The children were naked, without shoes, without food. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">In the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , the guards surrounded us. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Where are you going? </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Why did you come back? </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Well, we heard this and this. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Nothing is true. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">There were old people who said well, if we have to go back, we'll just die on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">It's cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">We are hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Then they thought about sending us to .In we...these people arrived at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> of the gendarmes and somebody, probably the mayor...I don't know who...then said why did you run away from . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">You had <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> there, and you ran away, because we don't have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to put you up. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">All the people who leave here from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> who are here, we don't know where to put you up. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Go back...or we don't know what to do with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">One of the people I remember of the <span class="NPIP">places</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> which was just being built, was still in construction. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">It was being , no <span class="DLF">windows</span> , just the <span class="DLF">outer walls</span> , no <span class="DLF">doors</span> , no <span class="DLF">roof</span> , just ground on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , bare ground, and that's where they took us. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">But this would be our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">We have no other <span class="NPIP">place</span> to put you in. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">We were even happy with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">At least we were protected from . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">They showed us, somebody from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , are going to find some straws. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">We put them in the <span class="NPIP">window places</span> and in the <span class="NPIP">door places</span> and on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> to protect ourselves, so we built this protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And each of us took a little <span class="NPIP">place</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">We already knew how to do this, and we stayed there also with this two hundred gram of flour. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">It was not...probably was a practice everywhere, even in the larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">That is what they distributed probably everywhere, because . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">We would have liked to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">We ask to have some jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">In , | went to some fishermen to see if I could work with them, to make a little living. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">I was just idle. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I wanted to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Others wanted to work, not really for money but to work for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Anyway, no, we couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">No, nobody gave us any work. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Nobody talked to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">They didn't ask us who we were and even there people started dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">In the morning when you would wake up, you saw your neighbor dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And the guy who distributed the rations, the flour, must have heard something and ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">He took his wife and in the morning when we were waiting for our flour, nobody bring it. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">He ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">When we heard that...when, you know, when you are so desperate and you are in a situation and somebody who 1s a little smarter...at least we thought he was smarter...when he leaves you, we lost all hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">We just thought that this guy who had been more capable than anyone ran away, then we thought that we were really gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">It is the end of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">We stayed a little longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">We chose another chief who'd find the flour, but people really starting to die, many of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">My wife told me that, you know, I was a strong man. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">If I had stayed there longer, I might die too , so my wife told me like this...go, run away, run, even if you don't succeed, you'll die somewhere but...

ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">My sister was near my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">They were just dressed in very light clothes that they brought from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">They had her shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">She was barefoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">We were in wretched conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">We hadn't cut our hair...I was thin, close to...so she tells me, I don't want to see you. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Go, and if God willing you come out alive...(crying)...take care of me and of your sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">We borrowed from a woman some slippers made of rags and they were two sizes smaller than my size, so they didn't even fit but I was happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I tied them on my feet with some rope. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">My heel was kind of hanging out but anyway I put some rags around my feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I took my violin with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I bid farewell (pause - crying)...so I bid farewell to my sister and they left there and I thought that it's probably the last time I'm going to see them again, that I'll never see them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">I knew what I was going to leave them because I knew where I was going to go, but I didn't know whether I'd get there or if they would survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I cut through some <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">You had to make some detours, and I arrived at a <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . _ </span><span class="sentence" id="299">already. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Back at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> _ there was no longer like before. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">How shall I say...empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I mean there were many, many people, many soldiers and they didn't notice me when I arrived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I was with another guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Nobody really noticed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">It was dark too and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was there already. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> probably came from ____or somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">This <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> had some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> and also some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> for, you know, third class...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">people's cars</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I had my violin with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I didn't leave it there, and the other fellow had a guitar. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">We boarded the long, long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We got on. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">We stayed there in a little <span class="NPIP">corner</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> left and we left with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">We went and went. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">They didn't open the <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Nobody asked us anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">We just kept to ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">At a certain point, 1t was maybe after midnight already, the <span class="DLF">door</span> opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">There was no light, not even in the <span class="BUILDING">train stations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">It was complete darkness. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">The <span class="DLF">door</span> opens to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and some...they start loading some bags with wheat, with corn... don't know what they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">They just loaded <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> freight with these bags and then farm workers who had loaded the bags, got on too, and they just sat on the bags in the darkness eating . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">We were like in the corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">In the morning when dawn came and they saw us...hey, this is...down with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So they must have been Russians, but probably they were afraid too. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Who knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Down with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I took my violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">He took his guitar. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">We got off the <span

id="331">I just have this sounded the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in my ear...and we went quickly to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">There were women who were going to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> and they had all kinds of goods to sell there. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">They knew who we were and they hid us in near behind their baskets and we stayed there until <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">In the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> , we got off. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">We looked left. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">We looked right. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Nobody was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Just a soldier, a guard at the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Near that <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , there is like a <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span> or something, maybe a <span

and near the <span class="DLF">gate</span> was this guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">We saw the guy, had I think a mark or some money, gave it to the guard in his hands, and we entered into this <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">There were several sculptures there, some statues. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I don't know who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">We...anyway, some statues. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And we kind of hid behind those. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">There were some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> and we just hid there and my fellow said, you stay here and I'll go in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Let's see where we can go. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Maybe I can find a Romanian railroad worker from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> because <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Romanian trains</span> would arrive to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Maybe I'll find a Romanian. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Let's see what we can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">If we managed to get all the way here, maybe we can get away from here, because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> if they saw you in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , they would arrest you, we know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">QUESTION:  What happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">ANSWER:  The week before, one guy ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Also a guy from ———_s~who was a violinist, a young man without any family. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">He was by himself or who knows...maybe his family was someplace else, but he was alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">He ran away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Maybe he knew that somebody in where he was from...I told you that...from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of or and so maybe a long time ago had somebody who had worked with this Romanian who was the owner of a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> in the <span class="DLF">Hotel Passage</span> (ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">The street King Michael the First, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">So this man, what did he do. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">He dressed this violinist a little better. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">He was kind of light hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">He was not that obvious that he was dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">He had some documents with the logo of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , and everyday in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> he tried to find a musician to take into the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , to the <span class="INT_SPACE">restaurant</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">He wanted a Romanian musician and he was looking for them in a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , because most of the musicians who were playing in the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> were Romanians. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">So they would send him to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> to find these people who ran away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , to see if he could put together small orchestra, and luckily my colleague found this fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">We kind of knew each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">He asked would you go with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">We have no time to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Do you want to come? </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And , you used to know . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Let's take . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Let's go. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">We got onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> and we went to the <span class="DLF">Hotel Passage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Nobody knew me. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">The owner didn't know me, but this chap from was already there for a while, gave me a key, gave us aroom. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">That night we didn't play because we were really...looked terrible and this was a good <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , a big <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , so the next day the old man who had distributed the food before, to us the flour, was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">I saw him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">So we met there. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">It was a small orchestra. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">There was a trumpet player, also picked up in the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> , and I found a comb. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I combed my hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I managed to pull myself together, and the next day I asked for an iron from the girls who were working there at the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I cleaned myself up, but my head...hair it was just long. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Anyway, the next night, that's how I played, with my feet in rags, unshaven. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I don't...in this <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , I don't now remember how much they paid us, how many marks we got every evening, because they paid us right after the show. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And so I made a few marks that night and the owner gave me some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I played the second night the same and I put together some money and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">bazaar</span> and I bought some shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I bought a shirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I went to a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> , a <span class="INT_SPACE">public bath</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I went to a barber. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I still remember today what the barber said, that he found some bugs in my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Of course who could have washed himself for weeks __, sol remember today how I was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barber's seat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">The barber must have told to his colleague...parasite...parasite. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I realized that he must have found a bug in my hair, but anyway he didn't kick me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">He cut my hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I took a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I shaved and by now I had my _. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Thad a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep but I didn't have any peace in my soul because I knew where I left my wife and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I used to cry all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">The girls who worked in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> saw me cry all the time, but I didn't tell anybody where I came from, only the people who were around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">One evening...so here, here in the...we played Romanian folk music at this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Many people who came to eat, they were Romanians who were coming back from the front, pilots, officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And I still play Romanian songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">When they heard the pilots, when they heard Romanian music, the Transnistria government department . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">There were Romanians there too in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">They were working for the government, young men who would come in the evening and take me to their <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> after I'd played, and I'd go with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">They would take an accordion player, a guitarist, and we would go with them and play for them a little longer, and they'd bring us back. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">But in my soul I was not happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I know I had food. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , but I wasn't peaceful. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">One evening, there was a big banquet, a dinner, and who gave it? </span><span class="sentence" id="415">A colonel, a Romanian one with his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">He was there, and hearing that there's Romanian folk music at this <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , he...that's where he decided to have the dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">We played. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I didn't drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I was a young man, but who knows what I did that evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">They fed us too. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I had two or three glasses of wine. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I started crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And I had this boldness that I said I just can't continue on like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I have everything I need here...food, drink, money, whatever money, but canI do anything __ this evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Can I do

QUESTION:  We're on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , on the way to , yes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  Well, I couldn't hide anymore because I was caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">The guy who was checking the tickets and a gendarme, a military man...I don't know what ____ he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">He was in a military uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">He was not an officer but a lower...maybe a major. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Ah, he says...I've been watching you. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I've been looking for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Odessa</span> I've been trying to find you in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and finally found you. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">We got arrested, both of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And between these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger cars</span> ...before those <span class="DLF">doors</span> some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> especially for prisoners that they were transports. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">There were thieves and other criminals, and they were transporting in a special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">They took us to put us in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">My companion was older. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">He had already done his military service. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">He told me, , get your money out and let's give it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">So, Mr. Radu (ph), I was left with nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Everything I took out...1 don't know my companion had anything left, but I tell you, I was so afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Everything that I had saved to save my family, I gave to this soldier and we put it in the pockets of the soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">He didn't say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">He didn't take us to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> but he left us...he let us stay on in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger car</span> on the <span class="DLF">corridor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">He pretended to talk to us, until we arrived in .In he kind of disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I don't know whether...I seem to remember he kind of took an oath or promise...I don't know...anyway we got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we crossed the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">The <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> were open or these <span class="BUILDING">pubs</span> , these <span class="BUILDING">taverns</span> , in and right away, we just crossed the <span class="DLF">street</span> to go into one of these <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">We found the instruments. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">We took them and we went into the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">We were...there was nobody in the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">The owner asked us, did you come from the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , because probably the other owner had ordered the Romanian to send him some musicians. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">He said don't you want to play for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Why not, we say. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">He takes out a piece of white paper, a blank sheet, and he writes up a contract between the two of us, and here we leave our instruments there. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I had quite an extraordinary violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">It was worth ten times more than the advance he gave us. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">So we left the instruments there, but we wanted to have some money with us so we left the instruments there. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">We said we'll go to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and wait for the people who are coming from Iasi to play and we will start playing that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">He gave us an advance but obviously the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> owner knew what quality violin I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Anyway, we went to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and this we were waiting and hiding until a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">We got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="517">No problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">There were <span

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because they were really checking the documents at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">We went into the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> and we stayed there near a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Nobody asked us anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">We were there like two patrons, standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">When the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> signaled departure, we got out of the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">It was the <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">We got back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and right away close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">We arrived in the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">My companion got off and the gendarme or border officer...I don't know who...grabbed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">My companion still had some of the money that from the advance and gave hima hundred __, made of a metal coin, monies which...anyway put a hundred __ to this chap and he let us go. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And I went to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I stayed there about two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Then I went to my former <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="535">You can't imagine when her mother saw me, my mother-in-law saw me, that I came without her daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">You can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">She fainted. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I promise that I'll go back and bring her back. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Anyway, she really didn't look with good eyes at me, like almost accusing me that I left her daughter and ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I told her that I came here so I could go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I told her who brought me here, although this _ didn't lift a finger for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">He didn't tell me maybe if I hadn't had any money, we would have even been arrested on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Anyway, we stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Everybody was looking at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Ah, you ran away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">In my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> there was a sergeant. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">How to...now they call them...a police sergeant, yes, in charge of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">The policeman, he knew everybody of course, and he wanted to catch me. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">That was his ambition. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">As soon as I heard he would arrive on duty, I'd run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And of course not long afterwards he caught me. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">It was already almost the end of '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="553"><span class="COUNTRY">France</span> were already broken in two, broken, and about two days...he said I'll let you about two days free and in two days you come back with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">If you run away I'll catch you. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">What did I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="556">My companion and I talked about it, and we said let's go back from where we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">He said, well, if we'll go, we'll just die there. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">What are we going to do there. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">We'll die. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">So we left for the ___. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">There we went into a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">We played a little bit more. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Meanwhile, this was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">My father-in-law went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">He was serving in the army, and he came...he had gone in

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="568">She had gone to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> I think, but he couldn't bring them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">He couldn't get them out because the girls' last name was the mother's maiden name, but the children did not carry the same last name, so he couldn't take them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">He was told to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> and to bring the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And you bring me the

<p><span class="sentence" id="575">QUESTION:  Tell me again so I understand...your father-in-law was serving in the Romanian army...
ANSWER:  He was to bring the two daughters, my wife and my sister-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">He went in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">He went there all armed. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">He took them some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">He took them some clothes, spare clothes, but he couldn't bring them out because he didn't have the same last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">He left them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Even if he had brought only one daughter...the older one...she would have survived because she was ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Then he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> to get the papers done. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">He went to ministries, to the army regiment, trying to do the forms, but he got ill.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="585">QUESTION:  Who got ill?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">ANSWER:  In the meanwhile my wife's sister became really ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">When the father went back the second time...I heard all of this...I wasn't there any longer...anyway I was no longer with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">When the father went back for the second time to pick them up, the sister was almost on her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">death bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">She had clothing now. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">He wanted to take the two daughters back. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">The older daughter couldn't resist any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">She took him back to the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> where she was living, left her there, and continued the way back with my wife and my little sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="593">QUESTION:  So let's go back to the __...
ANSWER:  In I played in a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , so in the meanwhile I had heard that my wife was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> but she will tell you how they came back also because they didn't have any papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">They ran away too. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Meanwhile I sent a letter to Iasi. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">When the letter arrived there, probably somebody read it and went to the police and said so and so didn't run away back to where he had to but he 1s in__, and one evening as I was playing in a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , three policemen or maybe two...it was maybe about eight, eight thirty in the evening...came all armed with the guns in their hands and told me to lay down my violin, during the program, while I was playing, and to stay still, not to put my hands in the pockets, to...and he was ready to handcuff me and my companion. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">You can imagine that having been there for a while, some people knew me in the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="598">The patrons knew me and they thought that maybe I was a thief, so I told the policeman why do you not handcuff me. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I'm an honest man. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">If you want to arrest me, arrest me, but without handcuffing me. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I can declare in front of you that if I'm going to try to escape or do anything against the law, you can shoot me. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">They agreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">They took me to the <span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">They locked me up, me and my companion. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Somebody from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> had been sent there to arrest me, these people from the police in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> had sent to arrest me for having run away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transnistria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">It was already the end of '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I arrived at the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">My mother-in-law hired a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">They said he's not a thief. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">He never stole anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">He didn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">in a police. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">See if he's not guilty, why detain him just because he's a gypsy, because he's a little dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Is that why you keep him? </span><span class="sentence" id="616">He didn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Maybe it's good for the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> or what? </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Why are you taking him to his death? </span><span class="sentence" id="619">So many young people died in vain without doing anything wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">So then probably the others were coming from the east, so they let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> but I was still not very much in peace because I was afraid anytime I'd say anything to anyone, they would again have me arrested by the police, because they said I was not Romanian. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">My <span class="NPIP">place</span> was in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> .
