<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION: Good afternoon, Renata, it's nice to have you here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER: Hello.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION: Can you tell me the name that you were born with and where you were born and when?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER: I was born Renate Laqueur and I was born on November 3, 1919, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brieg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Today that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> is <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , because it’s <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> and it’s near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I was shipped from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> three weeks old to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> because my father emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in 1919. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">So, this is why I'm more Dutch than German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION: Can you tell me about your early childhood and about your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER: My early childhood, let’s say, was of course in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I grew up in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My father and mother were both German and had their parents still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">We used to visit my grandmother in the summers because my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brieg</span> was a jewel of a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">It was a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with a beautiful <span class="DLF">garden</span> and a <span class="DLF">tennis court</span> and a <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> and in...in the twenties my mother's father was a...what do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He was making paper stuff, let’s say, like folders and writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">There's a word for it, I forget what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Anyway, he made his money in this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , or <span class="BUILDING">firm</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brieg</span> and she had the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">https://collections.ushmm.org My father was an intellectual. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">He had studied medicine and was mainly interested at that point in medicine and pharmacology. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">He never practiced medicine but was a Pharmacologist Endocrinologist and the interesting thing about this is that in the early twenties he starts in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to work for <span class="BUILDING">slaughter houses</span> because he wants the hormonal products of horses and cows because they begin the first hormone preparation in his <span class="BUILDING">laboratory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">He was first in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and ended up as the Dean of the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> in the thirties and forties. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Anyway, he... In his <span class="BUILDING">laboratory</span> they discovered testosterone. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So, he is one of the first hormone researchers and I grew up when you asked me about childhood, that my father would put Ponds Cold Cream on one cheek and another hormone cream on the other cheek to see which one worked better. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I think it was the Ponds. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">O.K. Early childhood, what more do you want to know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION: Brothers and sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER: Let me just quickly tell you about my mother because my mother was the artist in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">She sang. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">She painted. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">She was a terrific painter and terrific singer also a good looking woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Titian kind of reddish hair and lousy taste in everything except in art and music.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION: What do you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER: Lousy taste because she wouldn't throw out a thing and she would buy crap because she was stingy. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So, we didn't grow up in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> full of beautiful objects. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">We grew up with whatever was available. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Never had a decent new bought dress in my youth because that's the way they were brought up. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">You get hand me downs. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We were five children. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">There was an older sister https://collections.ushmm.org and older brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Me and my younger sister, so five. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I think one of the reasons why I got very orderly and very much into beautiful things, whatever, was a reaction to this kind of wild <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">But intellectually I think I owe both my parents the interest in literature, art, medicine, anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Anything except politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Politics did not play a role. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Religion was a very strange situation because my father and mother were both Jewish racially,but had never, ever been in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Even in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , so my father was born 1880. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">My mother was born 1883. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I've personally never been in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> except when I travel and if I'm in a group or if I'm in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> then the guide goes and shows me a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION: Were you conscious of the background of being Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER: I was conscious of this background and made more conscious of it by a sheer fluke. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">The <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> are not like here, private or public. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Every <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was public. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">You went to <span class="BUILDING">public kindergarten</span> , public lower grade, <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span> , whatever and then <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> is <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">To go into a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> you had to go at that time into a certain <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which prepared you for the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">If you went into a trade, there was another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">But if you had...If you didn't want to go to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , I couldn't make it to the <span class="BUILDING">university school</span> , I was too stupid. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I jumped from what they call a <span class="BUILDING">girl's school</span> into the second class of the <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I wasn't all that stupid I was just in protest. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">What made me very interested in https://collections.ushmm.org religion, I was 11 or 12 and I had to go, let's say, into the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where you either go to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> to stay in a <span class="BUILDING">trade school</span> or you could get a girl's education. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">At that time it was just nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And, I was a biker. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Like all Dutch kids, you were born on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> and I biked and I was careless. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And they wanted to put me in a certain <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which was right around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> because then I wouldn't bike so far and come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with a broken leg or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I got put into that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">It was a so called <span class="BUILDING">Hervormd Lyceum</span> which is not only Lutheran but it is the <span class="BUILDING">Reformed Lutheran church</span> , so the most Calvinistic sect of the <span class="BUILDING">Lutheran church</span> you can be in. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">That was my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , because it was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Then the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> moved out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and I was in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anyway, but there comes my religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">My religious background was <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> , Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">It was prayer every morning and so and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And it had some Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I wonder whether they were there because it was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I think they were there because it was a very good <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And so, this is where the Christian background comes from. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">The other thing, there is a habit in my family which is very German that came Christmas around, number one we had a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Number two the kids were supposed to recite the Christmas story under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Christmas tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">The oldest kid first and by the time it reached me and my sister, it must have been close to the middle 30s, Hitler was there already because I was born in '19. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So this was the Christian background. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Jews were never mentioned except after '33. '</span><span class="sentence" id="77">33 the first immigrants came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> fleeing Hitler and my father immediately got into committees, helped and was on refugees committees. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We had refugees all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and we were aware of it, how lucky we were that we did not grow up in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> but in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I had also problems in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because they knew https://collections.ushmm.org that my parents were Germans and the Dutch kids hated Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">They had nicknames for them like in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> the Bosches and we called them the Moffen. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I was always the child of a moff father, which was a German father. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">The problem was that he was a professor, that he lectured at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> and that he was so ungifted with language that he never learned decent Dutch so that the students finally said, “Professor Laqueur do us a favor, talk in German because we can't understand you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So, he lectured in German, but wrote in German, English, whatever they wrote in at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I think they all still wrote in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Nobody wrote in English, in medical text. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Dutch, you didn't write because nobody could read it, but they wrote German. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">They changed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Science was German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION: Tell me about your brothers and sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER: Brothers and sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">The oldest sister was a woman, was a girl and she died after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Nobody knows about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I never mention her in the diary. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">She was over 40. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">She was born in 1906 so if the war was from 1943 to '45 she was over 40 or close to 40 and anybody who got typhus died over 40 because of the high consistent fever for 15 to 16 days and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">She lived outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> for part of her married life. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">She was married to a doctor in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and then came my second brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">My second brother, Peter, studied medicine and biochemistry and also got into endocrinology. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">He immigrated to <span class="REGION">South America</span> just before 1940, in 1939 because there was a branch of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> which made the hormones, Organon, which was part of Hoffman La-Roche. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So, there was a combination of pharmaceutical, endocrinology pharmacology on that side. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">https://collections.ushmm.org My brother, Peter, was an M.D. and Ph.D. and in <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">He emigrated later on after the war in 1946 to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and switched to psychiatry because of the drugs. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">The third brother was five years older than I. He did study medicine, but flunked out because he had the feeling, you know, you studied medicine because your father and your brother studied medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And he became a businessman, first photography and film in the 1930. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Went to the Berlin Olympiad to film. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I just saw on PBS the other day and I realized that Hein my brother was there for the Olympiad just to film. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">He was born in ‘14 so he was 22, 24. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And the younger sister, Lilo, 1s the one who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">She was born in 1922. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">All the other kids went to normal <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">They went to <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Nobody went to this Lutheran Calvinistic outfit where I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">None of them was as Christian as I was, because I saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I have to pray and I also tried to become a Catholic but that's a different story. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I had a Catholic boyfriend, but never Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So, Lilo married in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> a German refugee who was in international insurance, marine insurance with whom she immigrated in 1947 to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and she lived in <span class="REGION">West Westchester</span> and had three children and is today retired in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">She's a registered nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Again, medicine, there's always medicine somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">That's the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Now, my mother died in 1959 and my father died in 1967! </span><span class="sentence" id="123">in a very strange situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">He was with ' Renata misspoke here; her father died in 1947 not 1967. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">https://collections.ushmm.org his girlfriend in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and he was somewhere in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zermatt</span> near the very high <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and the Swiss Post Auto, you know, one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">busses</span> squeezed a woman who was running against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And he, as a physician, was called in and while he was administering help to this woman, he died of a heart attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">He had a bad heart, bad kidneys, bad heart, so this is the story of my father and there were write ups all over the New York Times, all over Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Ernst Laqueur died while he was trying to help somebody not to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">A question...
QUESTION: What was dinnertime like at your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with all these kids and your parents, what kind of a ...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER: That’s an interesting question. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">First let me tell you about the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">The food was always too much and too heavy. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Everybody was heavy. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">My people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> told me I want to be -- what do you want to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I said, “I want to be what I should be.” </span><span class="sentence" id="137">She said, “You cut everything you eat in half.”* </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I never went on a diet. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I lost what I had to lose and stayed that way for the rest of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Father disciplined because children were brought up not to talk unless they were asked questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Children were there to be looked at, but not to be heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">We were very well brought up. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We also had nannies. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We had a nanny, we had a cook, we had whatever and the nanny was, in many ways, more important than the mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">The mother was there when you were sick and when you were in trouble with your father, she would mediate. ? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">RL: “My doctors asked me, ‘What do you want to be.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I said, ‘I want to be what I should be.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="148">My doctor said...” https://collections.ushmm.org My mother was called, surprisingly, an avalanche which rolls up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">She was that forceful. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">She ran the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in many ways and my father was the guy behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> , always on the phone, always public relations. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I learned public relations from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Public relations before the word existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Team work, working with people was my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">My mother was an individualist and totally you do what you feel like as long as you don't run into trouble with the law, and that's it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION: Was she warm?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER: Was she what? </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Yes, very warm, but also very egocentric. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">If she was warm, you were warm., </span><span class="sentence" id="159">but if she was cold and she didn't understand you, she wanted you warm, and it wasn't that easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">The sense of humor strangely enough was my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">He had a kind of a understated...he couldn't have survived with that woman next to him if he wouldn't have had a kind of certain distance and a kind of an ironization of his own position.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION: Did you think they were in love with each other?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER: No, and I think this has been one of the traumatic things. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I never talked about that because to me it's so natural that I always knew he had girlfriends, but I also knew that the girl friends were not sexual and this is something which I never understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Girlfriends were achievements. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">They were either just -- I hope this doesn't go anywhere because this is purely personal -- they were either very beautiful or very famous or both or they needed him because he could provide whatever they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">It wasn’t persecution. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">It was a very complex relationship because I think sexually he didn't function. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I found that out by talking to one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I mean, I was the one who became very...and there was another thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I had tremendous https://collections.ushmm.org problems as a teenager and as a young woman because my father was afraid of temperament. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Afraid of passion, afraid of sexual involvement and he warned me, he said you're dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I was dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Today I'm gray. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">You look like a gypsy and you look aggressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I didn't even know what he was talking about but I understood much later that this was his fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">He loved me and he said, “You will never need to do anything except get married.” </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I think I started at the ripe old age between 40 and 51 to prove that I could do other things but get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">But when you ask me, “Did they love each other?” </span><span class="sentence" id="180">They may have been in love for a very short time, but again to give you the 19th century, when he married my mother, who was, of course, a virgin when he married her in 1905, he said, “If you don't have a son or a daughter in a year, it's over.” </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So, in other words, he wanted to propagate and I don't know -- I don't know whether these stories are true but this is what I remember in my family and there are other things that I remember which are not showing love. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">You're so long together, you stick it out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION: Were you close to any of your brothers and sisters?</span></p>

QUESTION: So, that must have been a very difficult situation in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="693">ANSWER: Yes, but we didn't know what they were leaving for. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">They were leaving very often, very optimistic because they were going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">There were no transports yet of old people, sick people. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">No, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">This was also, if I remember it well, I have to be careful now because I'm beginning to wonder whether I know it from what I read or what I really went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">To my mind, ‘til July 1943, there were no transportation yet of the people from <span class="BUILDING">mental institutions</span> or the old people or -- there were always Straf transports, which is punishment and we wondered what happened to those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Because we didn't know whether these guys were put to work let's say in the "mines" in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">We knew that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">We knew about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">We knew about the <span class="DLF">mines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">We knew about the <span class="BUILDING">chemical factories</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="704">We knew a little about <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">We knew mainly about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Don't forget <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Something which I also found out with the dissertation, no real, what do you call it, annihilation, last solution with gas was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708">They're all in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Not in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , not in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="710">They were built east of where I was born, in <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="711">I always wonder why. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Did they really think it would make the difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">They would get points. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">It's interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Anyway, where were we? </span><span class="sentence" id="716">The five months. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Somewhere if I can improvise, there was nothing quite as bad as the fear of being arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Once you were arrested, you were rolling with the punches. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Because what you imagine is all from my experiences 1s almost worse, you can't imagine things which happened later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I didn't know I would live among the dead and the sick and the hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I didn't know what hunger was. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I didn't know https://collections.ushmm.org what dehumanization was. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">You can't imagine.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="733">ANSWER: Yes, I immediately made friends and friends who later on were sent on. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">When I had left I know that they were -- they

id="741">I only know of certain circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I think the whole thing about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> to me is everything I wrote in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> are facts. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Everything I did before and after are part of a mechanism where I somewhere struggled to stay above it, not get involved again. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Talking about friends, talking about family, talking about pain or illness, about whatever, but I can tell you one thing, it all came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Under anesthesia and when I had cancer and I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sloan-Kettering</span> , 1992, https://collections.ushmm.org they find colon cancer, invasion of the lymph nodes, chemotherapy, the works at Sloan- Kettering. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">I'm again dreaming and fighting being strapped, being tethered to a

months they stopped it because I had too many side effects. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">But I tell you, this is something that goes so deep that I fight anytime when I need anesthesia whatever, even at the dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Since the war, I will not go under unless they absolutely hit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Because I'm out of control. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I need control to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And that goes very deep because if you ask me about friends, love, decency, everything stops because I went through so much which I didn't like what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Among other things I ate Paul's bread, Paul's ration. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">The guy was six foot three and I'm just a little person in comparison and I ate his bread and I did things which are not -- it's sheer survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">One thing I never done and I'm very proud of it, I've never done any prostitution. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">I had occasion, but I didn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Not because of moral thing, because I told myself that's stupid. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Because you do it with one you have to do , it with a couple of other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">So, I have no moral convictions and I came out totally an amoral person. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">It went so far that Paul said in 1945 when we were back <span

class="sentence" id="768">I said, “Who's paying whom anyway?” </span><span class="sentence" id="769">But whatever, I learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">I learned because if you live in a

way. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">But I'm very bitter. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">I'm very bitter about things and especially when people complain and when people say, “Oh, but if Hitler wouldn't have been there and if this and this and this wouldn't have happened and if I wouldn't have come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and maybe I should have done this...” I say,
