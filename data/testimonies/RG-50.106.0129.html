<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Well, they got the affidavit from Uncle Jassie in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">The -- the hard part was that my grandparents wouldn’t come. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And so they left them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and my two aunts and my mother, they had to say goodbye to their mother and father, and that was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And my mother really never got over it, I don’t think Ceeta ever got over it either. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">They went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and we have letters from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where they’re living in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and letters that we sent and packages that we sent were opened up and -- by the censors and money and food was taken out, so that they would get a little bit of what we had sent, but not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And that happened through 1940 -- °39 - ’40 - ’41, then ’42 we had no more correspondence, they died.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  Yes, we said goodbye to our friends who lived in the <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And of course my close relatives, very fortunately were able to come with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Uncle Ben, who was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , my Aunt Esther bribed a Gestapo and they let him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Her story is that Hitler was willing for Jews to leave if they could get out somehow, and we -- she went ahead and got the papers and we -- as we said, a -- a vacation to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , but our intention was never to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  Were there any last minute glitches before you could leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  No, other than saying goodbye to my grandparents and having them go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , which was the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> that they went.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  What did you most regret leaving behind, for you personally?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  Having to leave my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and the people that I knew in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">That was all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  When did you leave your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Do you know the date?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  Perhaps January, 1939, cause I feel that we were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> in February, and took a few weeks, we had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and make arrangements for my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">They did get an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but --

<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  By <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  I was seven years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  When you get -- when you got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , how long were you there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  We were there a few weeks, until we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Oronoco</span> and a -- my cousin says that after we were dropped off in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Oronoco</span> that the next time the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Oronoco</span> sailed, 1t was torpedoed. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So I don’t know if we have any record -- we don’t have any records of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Oronoco</span> , I thought maybe the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> might.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  Do you know what registry it [indecipherable] under?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  No, no, just the name, that stuck with me.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  -- we’ll go back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">You mentioned saying goodbye and then leaving and going on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Did you have any problems at all actually leaving <span class="REGION">German territory</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  Not that I recall.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  I asked you if you knew what registry the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> had, was it German registry, or was it other than German registry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  Well, it had a Spanish name, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Oronoco</span> is a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> in <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I don’t know if that had anything to do with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  When did you realize that you were no longer in German control?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  When I was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And there, life was somewhat normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">My parents and everybody got very seasick, but I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So I continued eating and running around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Can you describe the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> a little bit to me? </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Tell me how large it was, at least how large it seemed to you as a seven year old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  Yeah, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">It seemed like a very large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and we ate at a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining room table</span> like you would, I don’t know like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cruise liner</span> , but to me it was a large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and we had <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to run around on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> and my brother and I played on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Oh well, my Aunt Ceeta, the younger of the three sisters that were coming over, because it was such a rough voyage her baby could not keep any food down and died on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And I remember this, he was buried at <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , and my Aunt Ceeta never got over that. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">That was a trauma that stayed with her all her life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  Was the child sick before the voyage?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  No, child was alright, but he was s -- 1t was a boy, six weeks old, couldn’t hold the food down. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So became, I suppose seasick like the rest of the people and died from dehydration.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  Can you tell me what the cr -- the crossing was like for the adults? </span><span class="sentence" id="157">From your perspective, what could you see the adults going through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Well, they were worried about what life would be like, they would talk about the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">My mother and my aunts started studying English, since that was our destination, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So they were studying even onboard, when they would sit out on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">They had their English-German dictionary and they would try to converse with each other in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And then of course there was the problem of learning Spanish, which I don’t think they studied until they got over to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So a lot of the time they were talking about how we would make a living -- how they would make a living and how they would get along with the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">That was the main topic of conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  Besides your family [indecipherable] who were the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passengers</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  I mentioned that there were some friends of my family that were left off in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , so they were refugees like us. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Seems to me that they -- it was a boatload of refugees, people who were fleeing from Europe because they knew it was bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  How long was the crossing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  Seems to me it was two weeks, but they had to stop the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> because of some problems, mechanical problems, so we were on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And then that was repaired, so it took about two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  And besides running around the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> with your brother, what did you do during those two weeks during the day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  I do remember now we brought some books, so I was reading and that was in German, cause I was trying to learn a little English also, but that -- I didn’t learn too much there. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I learned more when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Played with my cousins because we were all very close together. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">My father and my uncle were brothers and my mother and my aunt were sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So two mothers, two women married to two brothers -- two sisters married two brothers, so my relationship with my cousins were double, very close, almost like brothers and sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I was the only girl, everybody else was a boy, so I had a very close relationship with Aunt Esther because she always wanted a girl.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  Tell me about your arrival in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">What was that like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  We arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Battista</span> was very good to the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Seems like Cubans didn’t have any feelings of anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">They did put us in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to hold us until we could get settled in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and treated us very nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">There was food morning, noon and night and they treated us to something that was their delicacy, but we didn’t like it, was fried bananas. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And we stayed there a few days and my Uncle Jassie, the one who signed the papers, he was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> , and I understand now he sent money to us every month, to mine -- all three families, so that we could survive in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">The story I got from my father was that he immediately went to work, which he did, and earned money so that we could be supported. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">But he had help. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">But he did go to work, went to work on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Carried around the package that he was selling from <span class="DLF">door</span> to <span class="DLF">door</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  No, they seemed to know that -- what the reason was and they allowed us to stay there without any hassles. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">In fact, some of the people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that we made friends with stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> until Castro came in, because they began to make a good life, right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">So that we had some friends that stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">QUESTION:  Tell me about starting <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> and where you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  Well, it was near my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because I -- I could walk to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And of course it was very strange because I wasn’t speaking anything at all, I couldn’t understand anything that was going on, so I kept quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And then, after a couple of months I was able to begin to speak a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And the children were nice, you know, you could play on the <span class="DLF">playground</span> without talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And then I picked up some words, and began to have some friends with them, especially that little girl who lived near the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And she was in same class I was in, so we had friends in -- I had a friend in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I had a friend at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> besides my brother and my cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">We were always close, my brother Max, Manny and Jackie. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">They -- they remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> , I moved up here to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION:  Were there any other refugees in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">ANSWER:  Yes, there were three or four other children, who might have been -- I -- I think they were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> with us, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And they had the same problems I did trying to learn to understand what the teacher is saying because they spoke only in Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And somehow we picked up the language, I think more from the children than from anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And then we were able to use our knowledge to get some of the work done, but never as good as the children who were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">QUESTION:  In what ways was your life in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> what you had expected it would be and what ways was it very different?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">ANSWER:  Well, they didn’t seem to have any winter, it was warm all the time, whereas in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , of course, it was a different kind of climate, we were cold in the winter and hot in the summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And so we wore less clothing and Batista, who was the dictator at the time, he was -- I think he thought of the Jews as a middle class, because he didn’t give us any problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">If anything I think the Cuban government helped us get settled into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And there were some agencies that provided us with food at the beginning, until we got settled.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">QUESTION:  Aside from the refugees, people who perhaps came on your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , were there other Jews around in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">ANSWER:  Yes, there were some Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">They were of European extraction, though. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Some of them had come there earlier, 10 years earlier than we did and they had established themselves and were doing well economically, so that we did meet some of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  Was there a -- any kind of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in your -- in your area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  There was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , but I don’t remember going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , so I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">We may have and we may not, I just can’t remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">QUESTION:  What Jewish traditions could you continue to observe in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  Oh, well my mother kept kosher, and we observed the Shabbas in -- in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so that I couldn’t go out to play on sat -- I could go out to play, but I couldn’t go to the movies or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">So 1t was the food and observing the Sabbath.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  What about holidays?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">ANSWER:  We celebrated them with my family that came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And we lived together. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">There were several <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> in this <span class="BUILDING">complex</span> and so we all lived near each other, because I would play in my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and then run over to my c -- c -- to Ceeta and Uncle Ben’s <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and to Esther and Herschel’s <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So we were very close in that it seemed almost open air like. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I think the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were kept open most of the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">QUESTION:  Was your mother able to get kosher meat and other foods?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">ANSWER:  As far as I know she was, so there must have been a <span class="BUILDING">kosher butcher shop</span> .</span></p>

QUESTION:  -- the S.S. Saint Louis, and I wanted to continue along that <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">The other refugees that you met, were they people who had just been on your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , or did you meet anybody who had come in any other way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  Some of them were people we had made friends with on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and there was one family we met who had come there in probably 1931 or even earlier, and he had a s -- he and his family had established themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And their children were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , so even though -- they were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , but he was a man who knew early on things were not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So it must have been like, maybe late 20’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So we were friends with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Other than that, I can’t remember who else we were friends with.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">QUESTION:  So all the refugees that you knew, you knew from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I don’t know if we tried, but my mother knew it would be hard for me just to learn Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And then, we were also trying to learn a little English. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So she didn’t put me in <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">QUESTION:  You mentioned several times that you were still getting letters from Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Can you be a little bit more specific and tell me what was in the letters that you were receiving while you -- if you can remember, while you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> [indecipherable] what you were hearing in those first months after [indecipherable |
ANSWER:  Yes, life was very hard for my grandparents in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">They were very close to each other and they took care of each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">My grandmother was always -- had always been sick and we were sending packages over to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the censors would take out money and food so that finally when my grandparents got a package, it had been opened up and only small amount of what we sent was -- was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">They always talked about the fact that they weren’t hearing enough from my Uncle Beryl, who was established in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> , that he wasn’t writing enough, whereas my -- Bertha and Esther and Ceeta, my mother, my two aunts who were with us in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> wrote to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> a lot and sent a lot of packages over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And we heard from them in 1939, 1940, 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">In 1942 they -- that stopped, we didn’t hear -- of course [indecipherable] already.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">QUESTION:  Were there any additional attempts to get them out of Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  My grandparents didn’t want to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">They were afraid there would be no <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">They thought they were too -- they were probably my age which -- the age I am now, and yet they thought they were too old to travel across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I don’t know why -- well, Aunt Ella felt a very si -- as all of the sisters did, a very strong connection to their parents and she stayed with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">So that was the reason, I think, that she didn’t come, cause she was devoted to her parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">QUESTION:  Where were you -- if you remember the details -- where were you when you realized that the war had begun and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">ANSWER:  I -- when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> we heard that Hitler had gone into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , which was a great deal of discussion in my <span class="BUILDING">household</span> about what would be happening to the parents since Hitler was marching into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And we were very worried for them, concerned that they would lose their lives, which eventually they did, cause we never heard from them after 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So we were -- a lot of talk about what -- what could we do and it -- I don’t know, just seemed at that point we couldn’t do anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">QUESTION:  You heard about it in your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Did you hear anything about the war in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Oh, we had a radio, so I heard a lot of things on the radio, we heard a lot of information on the radio, but I don’t remember discussing it in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">QUESTION:  Did your parents ever explain what was going on in Europe to you, or did you just hear them speaking with other adults?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">ANSWER:  Mostly it was what I overheard them talking about with each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">QUESTION:  You mentioned the letters that you were getting. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Other than the letters, did you have any idea what was happening to the Jews in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">ANSWER:  Yes, when we -- of course, Esther knew, and Bertha, my mother, that when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , that things were happening to Jewish people, Jewish people were being arrested, we saw that. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">My uncle was arrested, sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and my, of course, the teacher left. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">So we knew things were happening then. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">We didn’t know the extent of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">We didn’t know about the millions of people who were going to get killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">We just knew that Jews were in trouble, and so we had to get out, even though it was a terrific decision on their part to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that they had known and to move halfway around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">QUESTION:  You also mentioned that you heard about the war on the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Do you happen to remember the radio reports and if they were objective, or if there was some kind of bias one way or the other?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  I don’t know, I just remember they saying that Hitler was marching into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and that things were terrible for the Jews and for the Polish people, because they were being, I believe, bombed by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">So that as far as I knew, it was an accurate account of what was happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">QUESTION:  At any time during your stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , did you personally experience any anti-Semitism?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="347">ANSWER:  About a year and a half.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">QUESTION:  And how did you manage to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">ANSWER:  Well, the quota for Jews coming into <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , we were then included in that quota, I don’t remember what the quota was. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ceeta</span> and Uncle Ben went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I think we landed in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and we stayed in mi -- in the <span class="REGION">Miami area</span> , northwest section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ceeta</span> and Uncle Ben took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> because her -- their brother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> and had established himself in business, he ran a five and 10 cent store. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">So that -- and that was where their uncle was, the man who had provided us with the papers to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">If we couldn’t make a living, he was going to -- he was going to help us live.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">QUESTION:  Do you remember the trip from <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">For some reason I can’t remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I just remember coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">QUESTION:  Remember your first impressions of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">ANSWER:  We got a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the northwest section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> and my mother and father and myself and my brother, my aunt and my uncle and my cousins lived together in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And they were very busy going away to work, and nobody had time to cut the grass. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">There was an old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in the <span class="DLF">driveway</span> , we played cops and robbers there. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And it was a Christian area and the teachers were very religious, there was a lot of Jesus and Christmas songs and there was some anti-Semitism from the children towards me. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Some -- one of the boys gave me sign of the finger cause I was Jew girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">We stayed there for awhile and then moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami Beach</span> , which was filled with Jewish people so we didn’t have that much anti-Semitism after I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">QUESTION:  How long were you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> before you went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami Beach</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">ANSWER:  Let’s see. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">We were probably in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> for about two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I remember they put me back in the first grade, even though I was at this time about nine, because that was the policy, that if you didn’t speak the language, they put you back. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Finally my mother, who was quite retiring and shy, but she did go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , she said, my daughter is nine years old, she really belongs in another grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">So they put me up to third grade, and then I progressed from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> for two years, then I went to -- we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami Beach</span> , lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">We lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">QUESTION:  Let’s stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> just a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">You were already in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> when a lot of things had been changed in the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Well, I was here when Pearl Harbor, when they dropped -- when the Japanese dropped the bomb on Pearl Harbor, so we were glad then that Roosevelt had <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> go into the war with the allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">That was a big turning point for us, we felt that that was one way -- we even hoped that my grandparents and aunt would survive somehow, because now the Americans were going to help us defeat Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">So was a joyous occasion when we learned that <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was going into the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  After Pearl Harbor, did you experience any anti-foreign sentiment, or any increase in anti- Semitic feelings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  Oh let’s see. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">That would still be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> and it was some anti-Semitism fr -- shown from the people, but there were organizations there also because they wanted to help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">My teacher asked me to come out into the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> and she said would I would want a Thanksgiving basket. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">So I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and asked my mother and my mother said no, we didn’t need it, we had enough meat of our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">But they were looking to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">They knew we were refugees, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">So there were people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> who were trying to help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">But some of the children got -- were anti-Semitic and they got that from their parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="389">QUESTION:  Did any of the children ask you about your previous experiences in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">ANSWER:  No, they didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">QUESTION:  When you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> , were you and your relatives the only Jews around?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Somehow we got into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> that was the -- so it was just the four -- the four adults and the four children living together in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we were the only Jews in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="394">It was northwest section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> which at the time was a Christian area. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">There were Jews living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> , but not the <span class="REGION">area</span> where -- where we got the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , where we rented the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">QUESTION:  While you’re in this <span class="BUILDING">rental house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> , what Jewish traditions did you still retain?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">ANSWER:  We were able to keep up the tradition at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , as we had done in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">We celebrated the holidays in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And since we had -- were fortunate enough to come out as a family -- we had the two families and always celebrated together. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Mostly it was Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Hanukah was not such a big deal as it is now. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I don’t remember going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Probably didn’t start that til <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami Beach</span> , which was a few years later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">QUESTION:  Were there any specific problems other than the ones that you mentioned, you know, learning the language and you know, being put back in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Did you have any other problems adjusting to life in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">ANSWER:  Well, I felt strange, different, because I was -- wasn’t speaking English the way the other boys and girls were speaking, so I tended to keep quiet until I was talked to, and then I would answer haltingly, because at that time I really wasn’t conversant in English, I was just learning a few words and phrases. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So I felt s -- like a stranger in the <span class="REGION">Miami area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And that took probably the whole two years I was there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">QUESTION:  And how were the adults progressing with respect to making a living and getting used to the culture and language?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  Interestingly enough my father and uncle went out and went to the <span class="BUILDING">wholesale houses</span> , got some dry goods and started selling it from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="411">They even had opened up a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in -- not too far from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="412">But that didn’t work out, they couldn’t make enough money on the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> so they closed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">But they continued making a living going from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And as I said my Granduncle Jassie had sent money in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> so that our income at that time was supplemented by him. ... </span><span class="sentence" id="415">We didn’t suffer too much in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> , I mean the -- we were able to -- to live from day to day until things got a little easier.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">QUESTION:  Tell me about the move from mia -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami Beach</span> and how that affected your life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  Well we moved from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to -- my father and my uncle didn’t get along too well living together. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">They had some pretty bad fights living close quarters like that with the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Then we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami Beach</span> and we each lived in separate <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> 1n separate <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> and that worked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And there again my father and my uncle did the same thing, they went out to -- well, they had connections already in the <span class="BUILDING">wholesale houses</span> , bought -- then they bought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , each of them had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> so they could drive around the <span class="REGION">greater Miami area</span> , cause they went back to business in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> , just a ride across the <span class="DLF">causeway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And I started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in South Beach elementary school and things got easier for me because I had learned the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">There was no anti-Semitism in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami Beach</span> because a lot of the people were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And there we did join a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Beth Jacob synagogue</span> and I went to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And there we were able to live the Orthodox life that we had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marktberg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on Saturday and my brother even led the children’s service. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">He had learned the Hebrew well enough that he could do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And we made friends in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was close -- the South Beach elementary school, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was close enough to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , we would just walk back and forth and see our friends in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and then play with them after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  With the move, and now living in a community where there were more Jews, did any of these children ask you about your experiences in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">ANSWER:  No, the children didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">The teachers did. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">They were interested in what I had experienced. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And so I would tell them about it, but the children weren’t interested in my background. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And at that time I was able to communicate with them so that I wasn’t -- I must have still spoken with an accent, but it didn’t seem to affect the relationship I had with them, we were just friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And they accepted me as I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And then we were all Jewish, so that helped.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">QUESTION:  What did the teachers ask you, and what did you answer them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">ANSWER:  Why -- well, they knew why I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , how it was over in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and I told them about Kristallnacht and having to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , having to leave my grandparents and they were very interested in that part of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Later on [indecipherable] when I was in eighth grade I helped my parents -- I knew the language by then so well that I helped my parents study for the citizenship, and -- I went over the questions with them, which was hard for my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">My mother could do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Questions, you know, about American history. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">But then, of course, I was learning -- at that point I was learning about American history, and one of the teachers even asked me to write a report on my experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">So I did, and I read it to the class, and then on the intercom. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">An-And that way the children knew, because they wanted them to know what was going on over in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">But the children themselves weren’t that concerned about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">They were interested in surviving themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">QUESTION:  After you read your paper, did -- nobody asked you anything? </span><span class="sentence" id="447">None of the other children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">ANSWER:  Yes, of course, after I read the paper on the intercom people came up to me and said, how long have you been here and what was it like. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">So then they did show interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">But the first step was the teacher asking me to write about it, to talk about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION:  At the time you were writing and reading your work, what was going on in the world at that point in time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER:  Let’s see [indecipherable] the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I think by then the war had ended, so that I was reliving some of the history that people had gone through that these children and -- and these teachers didn’t have -- really weren't involved in very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I mean, luckily they were able to go on with their own life. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Course there were young men who were dying over there, but most of the people just went on with their life in -- 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami Beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">There was no big concern except war bonds and some rationing, things like that were going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami Beach</span> the soldiers were being trained for the American army, so we would hear them marching through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami Beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">That was during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So I must have written the composition towards the end of the war, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And we did invite soldiers over to have Passover with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">So we were able to do that, to share whatever we -- my father made, with other people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  During the war years, how closely did you follow the news of what was happening in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">ANSWER:  Again, it was through the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">We would sit -- all of us would sit around the radio and listen, especially when President Roosevelt talked, so that we could hear his fireside chats, and he would tell us about what was happening in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And the radio -- and the news, we would listen to the news, we were very much concerned about what was happening in Europe, how Hitler was going through the <span class="REGION">European countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">We were very upset and concerned about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">All through the ray -- mostly through the radio, I don’t even remember the newspaper so much, just listening to the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">That was our connection with the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="469">QUESTION:  Did you ever hear any anti-Semitic statements on the radio?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">ANSWER:  No, I did not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">QUESTION:  After you moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> , did you have any contact with any other refugees in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami Beach</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">ANSWER:  I -- no. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">There were -- no, the friend al -- I don’t know if we made any friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> those two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">It was all business and going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami Beach</span> then we made friends with people who had lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami Beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">They were not refugees, they were Americans, people who come -- lived in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">QUESTION:  Was there anything about the way the Americans were responding to the war that surprised you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  It was surprising that people here could go on so easily with their life when there was so much destruction going on over there, going on with their lives here. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">But then in a way so did we. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">We were lucky and we started living. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">The only connection we had was the letters to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and back. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">That’s what made us aware of how terrible things had progressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">QUESTION:  Do you remember any of the details of those letters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">ANSWER:  They were always happy to hear that we were doing well in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Didn’t hear much from Uncle Beryl and der -- my mother’s brother was Jassie, Uncle Jassie, didn’t hear much from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">They -- we wrote that things were hard here to get started. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">They wrote back that everybody in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> from Europe gets started as a shoeshine boy but then works themselves up into big business, so that it would -- since we had to travel halfway around the world they said that we could -- that they figured we would do alright and we’re just lucky to be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And they were getting along okay, day to day. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Not enough food. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">If somebody left a little bit of food over they told them, of course, as we did over here, eat it up because -- well there you didn't know if you were going to get any more food because things were being -- w-were really tough in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">So they wrote about their hardships and they were always happy to hear from us, about the progress we were making.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">QUESTION:  Did you get the sense from those letters that they were holding back and not telling you everything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Because they were kind of -- somewhat happy that w -- they were getting along day to day, and I suppose not to worry us, not to worry my mother and my aunts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">QUESTION:  What else stands out in your mind about those years when you were in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was at war with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">ANSWER:  We were so worried about what was happening to the people in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">We never really knew after 1942, so that was a constant worry about what was happening to the parents, what was happening to my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And that was a lot of the things that we were talking about around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , concern for the relatives who had -- couldn’t get out, or had decided not to get out and then at this point couldn’t get out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">QUESTION:  Where were you when you found out the war was over?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">ANSWER:  I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami Beach</span> and just [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And at that point then we started contacting the Red Cross, but they never could find out what happened to my parents -- my grandparents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">QUESTION:  Were you at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> when you heard about the end of the war, or were you at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">ANSWER:  I believe I was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">We were jumping for joy. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I remember hopping up and down, saying it’s ov -- finally over. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And my mother and -- my father wasn’t <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- my mother and my brother and I were hugging and kissing and happy that it was finally over, hopefully that we could be -- find some of those relatives who had left but who had not left with us, but we could never do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION:  When did you begin to realize the full extent of the genocide?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">ANSWER:  It was after the war that we started realizing that so many people had died in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> that we were just astounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I mean, we thought perhaps they’d be arrested and kept for a few years, but never that they -- anybody was put into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> and killed like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">So it was about 1946 - 1947 that we began to realize the extent of what had been happening over there and how fortunate we had been to get away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="511">QUESTION:  And how did you learn about all the -- the deaths over in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">ANSWER:  When we contacted the American Red Cross and as far as I know they never could trace what happened to my family, so we just assumed that they died. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">We don’t know exactly how.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">QUESTION:  Do you remember how the American media reported the news of the genocide?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">ANSWER:  They -- they talked on the radio about Jews having been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I don’t remember that I -- I knew any numbers, like what you heard later on about six million Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I just knew that a lot of Jews were being killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">QUESTION:  We’re going to pause so I can change tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Ruth Alper. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">This is tape two, side A. And we were talking about how you came to realize the full extent of the genocide, and I’d like to continue with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I had asked you how the news was being relayed to the American population. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I’d like you to continue to speak about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">ANSWER:  All right, we heard a lot of it on the radio and we did go to the movies and we would see the newsreels and see what had happened and it was horrifying to see the actual pictures of the cons- concentration camp people who had been just down to a shell of a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">So that at that point after the war, we realized more how horrible and how horrific the whole thing had become. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And we never did find out what happened to my grandparents and my Aunt Ella.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">QUESTION:  How did the American population sitting next to you watching the newsreel, how did they react to this news?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">ANSWER:  They were also horrified when they saw what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">They were just -- it was unbelievable, the slaughter and the inhumanity that had occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">So a lot of the people that we were friends with -- and they were Jewish, but they had been American Jews so they didn’t have to go through what we went through, but they just thought it was the worst thing that they had ever seen in their whole life and they’Il probably never see anything so horrendous again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">QUESTION:  Did you ever get a sense from the non-Jewish American population how they were reacting to this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">ANSWER:  They were -- they were also horrified, but it hadn’t affected them as badly because many of our Jewish friends had family who had gone through some of these times, so they were more inclined to feel the horror that had occurred, whereas some of our American friend who were not Jewish heard about it, but it wasn’t as hurtful as it was to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">QUESTION:  Did any of your loved ones or former neighbors or friends, any of them survive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">ANSWER:  Well, the friends that we saw in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , who left the Oronoco in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , we never heard from them again, so as far as we know they were sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and died there. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I don’t know of any survivors after that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">QUESTION:  Did you follow the Nuremberg trials?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">ANSWER:  Yes, I felt that 1t was important for those Nazis who had incurred this wrath on us that they should be punished for what they had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">So that I felt the Nuremberg trials were justified and I felt that they were something that brought it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> more to Americans than we had known before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">QUESTION:  Did you feel there was justice at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  Yes, I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">QUESTION:  Did you follow the debate on the partition of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">We were very anxious that those Jewish people who were trying to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> were having problems on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> , so that we could identify with that because we had been on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> also. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Luckily we were able to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , but we were really concerned that those people who were leaving a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holocaust area</span> would again meet such determination not to be able to come into a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where they might be able to have some freedom of expression and perhaps no anti-Semitism because it was ga -- we were hoping that it would become a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">QUESTION:  Have you ever considered moving, you or your parents, your family, ever considered moving to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">ANSWER:  No, and we had my Uncle Ben’s family, who had go -- his brother had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> early on, before Ben. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Ben said he never considered going there because he had a -- he was a tailor and he was working in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , he didn’t see any reason to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">That was in the early 1930’s, then later on when we all left, well that was -- he was imprisoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">There went the -- his income and whatever there ha -- whatever reason he had for staying in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was absolutely gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="549">QUESTION:  Do you remember the Eichmann trial?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">ANSWER:  Yes, I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And I felt the Israelis were right to convict Eichmann of these terrible crimes that had been committed against humanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I felt that he had gotten what he deserved, even though they were all saying they were just following orders, there is a time when people have to consider that they are murdering women and children and men who had no other reason for being killed except for the fact that they were Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">QUESTION:  Can you recall the reaction of some of the Americans around you to some of these events like the Nuremberg trials and [indecipherable] and then even the nur -- the Eichmann trial [indecipherable] 1n American media. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">If you -- if you could kind of tell me how it was presented and how it was received by the American public?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  Well, the people that I knew felt that these trials were justified because they had also heard about the horrors that had gone on so that they felt that these trials were necessary, that the state Israel was necessary and they even felt that if it hadn’t been for the Holocaust there might not have been a state of Israel. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">But people were feeling so guilty about what had happened that it was time that the Jews were able to develop a homeland of their own so that if God forbid this ever happened again, perhaps then people would go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to be somewhat safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And the people that I knew felt that the Germans needed to be executed themselves as a result of what they had done during the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">QUESTION:  The Eichmann trial came in the early 60’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Was there any sense that you could detect from Americans that perhaps the war is over [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  I detected that with some of the -- th-they’re trying to get some Nazis who are living in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> and in <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">So I have ha -- I got that sense from some of the Americans that I knew that it was old history, these are old men, they shouldn’t be bothered any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">But we felt that it had to be because they had lived through that time and they knew exactly what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">They all knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">QUESTION:  Tell me about the education that you were ultimately able to get in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">ANSWER:  Well, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">South Beach</span> elementary school. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Then Ivan Fisher Junior High and then my <span class="BUILDING">senior high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Then I went to <span class="BUILDING">University of Miami</span> where I met my husband, who was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And I got my Bachelor’s degree there. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And we got married, lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> for awhile, then my husband got a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Towson</span> , <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> and taught at <span class="BUILDING">Towson University</span> , which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , and I moved with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I had taught in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> , I taught <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I took off for about seven years to raise my children til they went to second and third grade and then I went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , taught <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , got a Master’s and credits beyond that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">QUESTION:  Where did you get your Master’s degree?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER: <span class="BUILDING"> Towson University</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">QUESTION:  And how many children do you have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">ANSWER:  I have two children, a boy and a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">They’re both married and they have two children, boy and a girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  What did you tell your children about your childhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  I told them that I had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and my trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">The one who is very interested in this now 1s Rebecca, the 11 year old granddaughter, who goes to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Potomac</span> , <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> and they’re doing a good job there about educating the children on the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">So she -- and she interviewed me just two days ago, also had a list of questions for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And then I gave her one of the sterling silver pieces of sterling that my mother had brought over so she could bring it to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> and share with the class.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="581">QUESTION:  In what ways do you think your experiences in your childhood have affected the way that you raised your own children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">ANSWER:  I wa -- well, on a personal point of view, my mother was ahead of her time in that she knew psychology before psychology was in -- she felt that positive reinforcement was very important in bringing up children. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">So my brother and I both feel confident about ourselves, and I tried to do that for my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">So that’s a personal point of view, that I brought them up in a positive way. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">They did know my history as they were growing up, I never hid that. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I did feel that I didn’t suffer as much as my mother and my aunts, but I told them about what ha -- about my background.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">QUESTION:  Do you speak publicly about your experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">ANSWER:  No, I have not done that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">QUESTION:  Have you ever been interviewed before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">ANSWER:  No, I haven’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">QUESTION:  Why are you willing to do an interview now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">ANSWER:  I was persuaded by Amy Rubin at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I explained to her that I didn’t feel that I had suffered like other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I wasn’t sure that my story was as important, and Amy Rubin said that that was -- it was a legitimate reason for being interviewed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">QUESTION:  Do you belong to any survivor groups?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="597">QUESTION:  Have you ever returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="598">ANSWER:  I did return to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but I didn’t go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marktberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I went on a trip to s -- to hear opera and to see some of the other coun -- parts of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I did feel uncomfortable with people my age because I always wondered, what were you doing during the war, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Who was putting us to the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and all that horror.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">QUESTION:  How did the Germans react to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">ANSWER:  I -- I didn’t tell them about my past, so as far as they were concerned, I was just a tourist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">QUESTION:  What have we not discussed in this interview that you would still like to -- to talk about with respect to your experiences as a result of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">ANSWER:  Well, the important thing was the trip over from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , the fact that Aunt Ceeta lost her baby, never told her boys who were born in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> that they had a brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">The fact that my mother never got over the fact that she had to say goodbye to her mother and father on the <span class="DLF">dock</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">She always had that in the back of her mind and as a result of that, she had some mental problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Esther did not, her sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I think it was as a result of that but maybe she would have had it anyway, but it -- you know, she was just devastated and felt guilty that she left, went on with her life and left her mother and father to die in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And then my Aunt Ceeta we -- on her tape she said that she couldn't talk about it either, going over it, so she said, and we said -- and we parted, is what she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">So the loss of my grandparents and my aunt and uncle are the things that I feel the most.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="612">QUESTION:  Is there anything about you and your experience that your family and friends don’t know that you would perhaps like them to know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">ANSWER:  We, over the years have made many friends with people who are not Jewish, especially the professors at <span class="BUILDING">Towson University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">There were only a few Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">So once I -- we became friends on an intellectual and a social basis, I would bring up the fact, number one, that I was Jewish, so that they could see that Jewish people are people of quality also, and then I would tell -- oh, I remember sitting -- I wou -- when I taught <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at <span class="BUILDING">Franklin elementary school</span> , which was in <span class="REGION">northern Baltimore county</span> , sitting around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and talking about my Aunt Ceeta losing the baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And these were people who did not know too many Jewish people, there was an <span class="REGION">area</span> at that time who didn’t have Jewish people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And everybody around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">faculty table</span> just stopped and listened. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And I felt I wanted them to know that was me, so they could have a little understanding of what some people had gone through.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="619">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you’d like to add before we conclude?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="620">ANSWER:  Well now that we’ve done the interview I’m glad I was interviewed and I hope this helps to keep the history of the Holocaust alive so that it will never happen again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">QUESTION:  Well, thank you for doing the interview today, and this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ruth Alper. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">End of Tape Two, Side A Conclusion of Interview </span>
