<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Can you tell me your full name and when and where you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Leonard Zawacki and I was born on January the 20, 1916 in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grujand(ph</span> ) which at that time was under the German occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Tell me a little tiny bit about your childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Well, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and I finished, graduated from the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> which we called <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , and after the graduation I enlisted into the School of Foreign Trade in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And in 1938 I was called up to the Polish Army and as a graduate of <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> I only had to serve one year, and you served in <span class="BUILDING">cadet officers school</span> , reserve cadet officers school, which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And I was supposed to be released in October 1939 and as you probably know the war started on September 1, '39 and I took part in the fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I was assigned to a unit of antitank artillery and I took part in the defense of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and on September 27 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> surrendered, and I was taken as a prisoner of war and taken out first, out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> on the 28 of September to the west, and near a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prostejov</span> where we were kept, you know, thousands of soldiers in an open <span class="DLF">field</span> and meadows and then divided in four groups; south, north, east and west, and since I came from the north I went to the north group, and we were loaded then on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and taken to the north, and we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Torun</span> , which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> some 40 miles south of my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , and there we were taken and unloaded and then taken to the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistul</span> 
ANSWER:  We came, arrived at the western part of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula River</span> and the two <span class="DLF">bridges</span> which were across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span> were both damaged, and we had to walk single file to across the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And there we were again assembled and we were supposed to go to the <span class="BUILDING">citadel</span> where they told us that we were only go to stay overnight and the next morning they were going to release us. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Of course, I realized that this was a lie, as most of the things they told us, and I, myself, separated myself from -- I asked the guard if I could go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> because we were near the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Torun</span> and he said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and I didn't return to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">He saw me going away and he said, where are you going? </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And I said, well, my troops assemble at the other part of the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and I have to -- and I think he realized that I was running away but he let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">So I went to the other <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , and there quite accidently I met my cousin, who never did serve in the Armed Forces, but he was in a uniform, a soldiers uniform and we got together, and somehow he was able to secure some blank forms which were given to people who considered themselves of German origin, and they were issued these passes and he had the blank forms. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">So we filled them out with our names and signed some fictitious names to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Of course, we didn't have any stamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Anyway, we boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and we arrived around midnight in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , and at the <span class="DLF">exit</span> all the passes were checked and there were the SS people and the SR people and the Armed Forces people, and when they looked at our passes they told us to step aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We stepped aside and then they gathered us. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I think there were 11 of us or so and they said, well, again you have to go to the <span class="BUILDING">citadel</span> overnight and then in the morning we going to release you. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Of course, we knew better than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So they marched us from the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , and my cousin was an owner of a <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> and we had to pass near the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> , and he told the guard -- we were in the last row and he told, he looked, still my name on the -- my firm name, and why do you want me to go to the <span class="BUILDING">citadel</span> for the night if I could sleep at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And he said, all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Go ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And then I told him, well, it's my cousin, can I stay with him there too? </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And he said already, go. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And we went and that's how we got away from being prisoner of war and spending the rest of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So I stayed overnight and the next morning I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and--
QUESTION:  Let's back up. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Why do you think he did that? </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Why do you think he let you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Well, I suppose because first of all we spoke German to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">We both did speak German and we more or less pleaded and -- I don't know who the man was. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Maybe he was a local man. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Maybe he knew us or at least he knew my cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Anyway, it seems that well he had some kind of feeling that he let us go. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I don't know and I don't know who he was or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">But anyway, he did let us go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  And one other question was that whole period -- what was it like? </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Was it very disorganized?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Well no, no, it was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">The Germans were not disorganized. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">It was very -- the terror was right from the first day, the Germans came, they started terrorizing people. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Matter of fact, some of my relatives who belonged to organizations which the German thought were unfriendly to them, they were arrested right on the spot and taken into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and shot on the spot and all trace disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So the terror was there right from the first day of occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And why he did this I couldn't tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Well, I can go further, and that was when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">It was in October in '39, and I think after three weeks I was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Not myself, with some other friends of mine, students. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I was arrested by the local Germans who formed special units, protective units. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">They called -- the German name was and they wore armbands, green armbands and with black lettering saying and they were looking Germans because my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had approximately 10 percent of the German population, and I was arrested just when we were visiting a friend and as we walked out of his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> they were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> and they arrested us, two of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Matter of fact, I knew one of the German. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">He was a young man also, attending the yimnasium(ph) in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">There were two . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">There were two <span class="BUILDING">yimnasium(ph</span> ), you know <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> , <span class="BUILDING">German high schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">One was in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and the other one was in <span class="REGION">southern Poland</span> in <span class="REGION">Silesi</span> 
ANSWER:  I don't know exactly which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> but I think it was Bitum(ph) and, so he was, you know, a student at the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and became this and, he arrested us and we were taken to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> as hostages. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">We were kept in a huge <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> and there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">It was only straw on the sides of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on which we for the night spread, and we had to lay on this straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We had no blankets or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">We were allowed, after a few days, we were allowed to contact our parents and our families and they could deliver to us food, because they didn't supply any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I stayed there for three weeks and only because a friend of mine who knew -- who had a German friend who was associated with some German organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Matter of fact, he studied journalism in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and, after he finished his studies he became a member of the propaganda ministry propaganda ministry, and his parents lived in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and he was visiting at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And my parents asked him if he could get in touch with this friend of his, whether he can get me released. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So they did one night. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I think at midnight they called me into a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where there was three Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">There was one in charge of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hostage camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">He was a local veterinarian doctor, German. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Then some other person which I didn't know and this friend of his, of my friend whom I knew only from sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And they interrogated me and, you know, what I was doing and what I intend to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And I said, well, I don't know, the war -- they said, we're going to release you but under the condition that you have to leave these <span class="REGION">territories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">These <span class="REGION">territories</span> which we lived, you know, were the western and <span class="REGION">north territories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We are right away incorporated right in into the German Reich. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">They considered these <span class="REGION">lands</span> as purely German. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So they said you cannot live here. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">You have to go to the part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> which was not incorporated into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> but which was formed as what they call it, General Government, and government general of this <span class="REGION">territory</span> was Hans Frank(ph) who was later on, you know, at the Nuremberg Trials was convicted, you know, to death and was hung. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And the <span class="REGION">territory</span> encompassed both <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kokov(ph</span> ) and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">It was the center of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they said, you cannot stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And then this veterinarian -- I remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">It was Grahams(ph) and he said, how long do you need to liquidate your things here? </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I said, well, three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">He said, you're crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">You don't need three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We want you out of here in a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So I said, of course, I agreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I would even go in one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And so they told me -- they released me. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I walked out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and this friend of my friend, his name was Lukow, I forgot his first name, he was a doctor of journalism. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Anyway, he walked out with me and he started speaking, and because he spoke Polish and he started speaking to me in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">He said, look, it's only, you know, you don't have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">You can stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">This Dr. Grahams(ph) said you have to but I can tell you you don't have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">You can stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And so I thanked him very much and I when back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , and the next morning I was supposed to be released and the next morning came and nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">They called some other names of other people released but not my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So I went to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and told the guard and said that my name was, shows supposed to be called. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And he went back to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and after a while they did call my name and I was released. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">But while I was there in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> one day they called ten names of ten hostages, and they took -- they were taken away and then they were publicly shot in the <span class="DLF">town square</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Today there's a monument remembering this, you know, they were innocent people that didn't do anything wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I knew some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">For no reason whatsoever they were shot publicly. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And after I was released, I think I didn't even wait a week, and again was my cousin because his property was taken away, you know, the fellow who had the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">It was confiscated and a German owner was put in his <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and he didn't feel secure and we both left and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And of course, I didn't have much means, you know, of supporting myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">My cousin being in the business, you know, had some savings and we lived together in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> for time being. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">In the meantime, he was trying to recover his property which he eventually didn't recover but they permitted him to go back, and he could run it because, you know, he knew how to run the business, and apparently the owner or the, what they called troyhander (ph) it means a man of who was, can't find the proper name of it, but anyway, somebody who was taking his, you know, and running the business apparently didn't do a good job, and he was eventually able to get the job back, not as an owner but as a manager, and he went back and I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">In the meantime, I did join, you know, the underground movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">It started -- the first organization was called Zydowska Organizacja Bojow
ANSWER:  ZWZ was the abbreviation, which later became the Home Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">The Army of Kroiova(ph), which was the army which was supported by the legitimate government, which was at that time was already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and I was arrested on the 31 of October 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">At that time --
QUESTION:  Before you go to that -- how did you find out about the underground movement? </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Tell me a little bit more about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  Well, I had a friend -- a friend who his name was Tobulsky(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="108">That's also was one reason why I was arrested, and he was also from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grujand</span> and, he was involved in an organization which was formed by one also a student in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> which he joined. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I didn't join because I wasn't there already, and they joined this organization and he wasn't caught, but the principal of the organization was caught, and he was tried and then convicted, you know, and sentenced to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And he was executed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poz</span> -- which was another quite a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which was incorporated in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And the executioned at that time was my -- he was -- they chopped you know his head off with an axe. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">He was axed, and this friend of mine, since he escaped and he came to the General Government to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , was tried in that and he was also sentenced to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And he already had connections with the underground and he contacted me and we got together, and he had -- he knew a captain of the Polish Armed Forces, prewar, who was member of the organization, and he swore me in as a member. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And I myself, don't think that I was arrested for that because I don't think they knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But they knew that I knew this friend of mine and since he had a sentence, a death sentence hanging over his head. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Apparently, they were following him because when they arrested me they came to my -- they arrested me at three o'clock in the morning on October 31, 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I was asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">bachelor's apartment</span> , one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , and in the night, you know, I heard tremendous knocking at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , kicking at <span class="DLF">door</span> , and I looked through the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I saw three people. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And one was in a Gestapo uniform and the other two were in civilian clothes and they were shouting to open the <span class="DLF">door</span> immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they pushed me aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">They came with drawn revolvers and they push me aside, and one went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and one went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and the other to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and they were looking around. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">They were looking for they said leaflets you know and for arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Well, they didn't find it either because I didn't keep anything at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Anyway, then they started asking me questions and one question was that your friend was here with you yesterday. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And they -- apparently he changed his name and he failed to tell me about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I knew him only by his new name, and so when they asked me was Tobulksy (ph) you know that was his assumed name, I said no, so they hit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">You know, you can see it here on the movies you know with the hand across there. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Hit me right in my temple and I fell to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and as I fell to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , they started, the three of them started kicking me and I said -- I remember the only person who visited me was this young Tobulsky and I told them his real name. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Apparently, they knew this and they stopped beating me, I got up, and after a while they had a small conference between the three of them and then they came back and said, you better get dressed and you will go with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So I got dressed and then they took me out, and the two of them held me by the cuffs of my jacket and they walked on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And this one in the uniform drew his revolver and walked behind me, and he told me, don't try anything because I'm going to shoot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So they took me down through the <span class="DLF">street</span> and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> waiting, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> -- they only drove <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> -- and they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and as they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> I saw another friend of mine sitting there, and he said, oh, you know each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And I said, yes, I do, and they told me to get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And one of the SS sat between the two of us and their chauffeur. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">They drove me to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , <span class="BUILDING">prison Pawiak</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and then approximately, already ten people from other prisoners, and they were registered and then taken -- I was taken to a single <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and there was no -- it was only a small bulb. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">There was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">There was no <span class="DLF">window</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">It was a <span class="INT_SPACE">dirt floor</span> , and the <span class="DLF">walls</span> were dripping with water, and there was only a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> which you used as a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And when I came there I didn't really know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">After a while a guard came and took me out and into the <span class="DLF">yard</span> and to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I had to undress and my clothes were disinfected and I had to <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And then after the clothes came back, my suit and so on, was all trampled they took me -- the guard took me to the first -- no, <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and took me to a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I don't remember the number of the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Anyway, the <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> were small. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">They were maybe seven feet wide and ten feet long, and there were already nine prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Which means, there were ten of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">There was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">We had to lie on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Again, there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> whatsoever except the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> where we could relieve ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We were only taken in the morning to the <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> where we could wash a little, and I think in the afternoon once and in the evening, and the rest we had to spend in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">At that time there were Polish guards, you know, prewar Polish guards as were as Germans, SS people, and some of the Polish guards were very friendly and pleasant and helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Some were not so helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Anyway, one of the guards in my -- I don't know how he found out -- but he found out that I do speak German, and one day he asked me -- apparently he was living in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which was Jewish-owned <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and it was requisitioned by the government and the Germans and apparently, whoever took over from the Germans wanted to increase his rent and he asked me, he said, on the salary which they pay me, I won't be able to pay the rent for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And he asked me if I could write a -- how do you say -- an application to the authorities, you know, whereby they wouldn't increase his rent. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">He took me to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and I did write the letter, and after a few weeks he got a reply. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And they didn't increase -- not only didn't they increase. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Matter of fact, they reduced his rent. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So he was very appreciative and he said what can I do for you, and of course, I wanted to tell him, let me go free from the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , but he said, what I can do for you, I can take you out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Since you do speak German you can be an interpreter, and he took me to another part of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> to another <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> which was served only by German guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And there I became an interpreter to this German guard, and of course, my life was a little easier because I was with four other prisoners in one <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> and we also had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I didn't have to sleep on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And two of the prisoners, who lived also in this <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , they worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">prison kitchen</span> and as such they were able to -- well, they had more food but they were not allowed -- they couldn't and they were afraid to bring any food, but what they did bring they brought always in the evening to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , whole pot of coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And the coffee was so sweet. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">They probably put pounds of sugar in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So we drank this coffee, this sweet coffee, which was not real coffee because the Germans, they wouldn't give the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">It was such a good coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Anyway, it looked like coffee and the sugar of course was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So I felt I could move free because they didn't close the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , and whenever the guard needed me to translate. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And so I did translate and in the meantime, I was taking for interrogation. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">You were interrogated in the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the Gestapo which was in the central part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and you were taken there by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And the guards were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> as well, as motorcycle guards as well as going behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and when you came to the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> , which were now located in the prewar Polish Educational Ministry, and one of the wings was converted. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">The <span class="REGION">southern wing</span> was converted into <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> where the prisoners, before they went for interrogation, were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">There were ten individual <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> and four, I believe four, common <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> and the common <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> , we -- the prisoners called them <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trams</span> because they were single <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> on each side of the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , and in the middle there was a <span class="DLF">walking path</span> and you had to sit facing the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and you were not allowed to look around or you couldn't talk to you, and the guard was behind you and if he heard you talk or move your head, he came and hit you over the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And you sat there motionless. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">You didn't get any food or anything to drink, and they called when the interrogating officer called. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">A guard came and took you up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I was taken to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there were this interrogating officer who was now in uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">When he arrested me, he was one arresting, he was in civilian clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">He was an officer of the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And there was a typist, a girl and interpreter. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Since he knew -- the interrogating officer knew that I spoke German -- he was very rude matter of fact, to the interpreter. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">He told him get lost, you know, he speaks German, so we don't need you here. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And then he started interrogating, questioning. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Actually, they didn't have anything, you know, which they could hang on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">They didn't find any leaflet. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">They didn't find anything and I didn't admit that I was a member of the resistance movement and they didn't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">The only thing they were about was a friend of mine and again, as I told them when they first arrested me. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And so it was typed and then the typed report was given to me for reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I read it through and then I had to sign it. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I did sign it. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Frankly, it was not incriminating to me at all except that I knew this fellow, and then he called the guard and the guard took me again down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> into this common <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> and I had to sit until all the prisoners were interrogated. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Sometimes, the interrogation went deep into the night and sometimes until the next morning of the other prisoners, and you had to sit there until they took you back or they loaded you back into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and then they took you to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So I was taken in the late afternoon back to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">In the meantime, you missed your food. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">You didn't get any food in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">The food was meager as it was but anyway, I still didn't get anything that day to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I can tell you one incident when I was awakened in the middle of the night by a Gestapo man. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">They came to our ward and they woke me up, and I had to interpret and they called 20 names out of different <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And these were hostages and I think some of them knew what the fate which they faced. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Most of them were very well educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Some were professors of the <span class="BUILDING">Warsaw University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Some were engineers and only one, I remember, was a criminal prisoner, and all of them behaved with tremendous dignity. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">They didn't plead or beg or anything except this criminal prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">He fell to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and begged to the SS man, kissed his boots, you know that, to spare him. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Of course, they wouldn't have anything of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And I had to interpret and they were taken, and they were taken <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and shot as hostages. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So thats the one experience I had in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I spent five months in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="BUILDING">Pawiak prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">During that time I had a girlfriend whom I left who of course, was not arrested -- and somehow she managed to send me a parcel, and how I knew that the parcel was from her because I couldn't communicate. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">You couldn't write any letters or anything like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">You could only send letters if a guard would take them on the sly, but otherwise there was no, no possibility of communicating. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">But I know that this what 1s from my girlfriend because she send me also a small pillow, and I recognized the pillow that it was from her, and she sent me some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">But the food was always shared with others and before it came to you it was -- the parcel was very skimpy -- but anyway, it was a sign that somebody did think about you. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And as I said, I was five months and on April the 4, 1941, in the afternoon the whole <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> population was called out in into the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , and there were already <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> set up and the Gestapo people were there with lists and they called the names of different prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And once your name was called you had to go to a different part of the <span class="DLF">yard</span> and stand, and my name was called too and I had to go, and those prisoners whose names were not called were then taken back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">The prisoner -- I think the capacity of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> was around 800 prisoners but there were approximately over 2000 or even more. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And they were preparing a transport and the transport was over a thousand prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">So after we -- the prisoners whose names were not called went back into the <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> , then they issued us I think -- I don't remember exactly but I think half a loaf of bread -- and we knew that we were going into transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Of course, we didn't know where but the word already was spreading in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> that there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> by the name, Polish name, Oswiecim, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And everybody dreaded it because the word was that it was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> , and we all prayed that we are not going to that camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">In the evening the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">SS with SS guards and also <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Warsaw municipal buses</span> arrived, and we were loaded into these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And we were loaded with shouts and with beatings. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">It was, you know, the SS people with bats, you know, and with bull whips, beating us, and we had to run into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> and then taken to the western part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">western railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">There again were on the <span class="DLF">ramp</span> , we were loaded into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Again, with beatings and shouts, dogs, and I don't remember how many prisoners to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> but there was <span class="INT_SPACE">standing room</span> only and again, there was no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">The only thing was a big drum which served as a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , and then probably around midnight they locked the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Of course, we didn't know where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Anyway, the next morning we arrived somewhere at a <span class="DLF">siding</span> , and we heard some voices, shouts, and barking, dogs barking, and then the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were opened and with shouts we were driven out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">You had to jump out. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">There was no <span class="DLF">ramp</span> , and we were put into formation in rows of five prisoners and twenty rows to -- .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">QUESTION:  Tell me what you remember about the forming of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> and did you see anything when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> got formed, and did you see people get rounded up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  Yes, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> was started sometime in 1940 and, you know, prewar there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">Jewish quarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">There was no ghetto. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">People could go freely but most of the Jews concentrated you know, in one <span class="REGION">section</span> and it was called the <span class="DLF">Main Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">There was Naleverky(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Matter of fact, the <span class="BUILDING">prison Pawiak</span> was right in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed, I think, I don't know exactly what month, but in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And at that time Jews -- there were orders given that all Jews, you know, had to go and register to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Now, many Jews didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">They also were by law had to wear armbands with the Star of David, and I don't think they in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> they didn't wear any Star of David on their jackets, but they had to have an armband with a Star of David. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">A blue Star of David as far as I remember and now those who didn't wear it, you know, could hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They just didn't wear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Now It's true that some of them were betrayed and they went to- they had to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">But the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> now there were <span class="DLF">gates</span> and you couldn't go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Nobody could. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">I think you had to have a special permit. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , for instance, there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trams</span> , you know, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcars</span> going through it but they were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">They were, for instance, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar trucks</span> separated one part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> from the other one, and in order from one <span class="NPIP">part</span> to go to it, there were <span class="DLF">bridges</span> built just provisional <span class="DLF">bridges</span> made out of wood, <span class="DLF">wooden bridges</span> where the Jews could go through one <span class="NPIP">part</span> to another <span class="NPIP">part</span> , and I think they could move around in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> freely. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">So that as much as I remember about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  Tell me about this man doctor, Dr. Eichner(ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I livedinahouse on __ Street, No. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">13, and this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> belonged to a Jewish owner, and I think if I remember correctly was his name was Volonov(ph) and he ran a lottery in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was confiscated, and there were on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , there were many other <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> which were all confiscated, and this Dr. Eichner(ph) who was a lawyer lived in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which I rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a friend of mine, a Polish couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I, myself, think that the owner of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was Jewish but he didn't declare himself, and he mostly lived with his parents who lived outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and he stayed there, but we rented one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And one day I was in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> standing there, and a fellow came across, you know, turning his walking stick and accidently hit this <span class="DLF">windowsill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">It was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> of Dr. Eichner's <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">It was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">As he twirled, but quite accidently, and he walked <span class="NPIP">inside</span> because he was a friend of the lady and, you know, where I lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">So when he walked in, and the doctor came to the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">The <span class="DLF">window</span> was open. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">It was in the summer, and he saw me standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">He said, what happened here? </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And he was quite rude, and I told him, and I told him in German that a fellow was walking here, twirling and accidentally hitting his <span class="DLF">windowsill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And so he calmed down, and then another day I was -- I met him in the <span class="DLF">walkway</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he stopped me and he said, tell me how come that you speak German so well. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I said, well, I learned in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I visited --, I also had some relatives in the free state of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Danzig</span> , which was mostly, you know, where you had to speak German and that's how I learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And he said, what are you doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I said, I'm not doing anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I was a student. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">The <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">The <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">You couldn't learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I said I don't have any. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Well, he said, why don't you come to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and I'll see what I can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I said, all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So in few days I went to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and he said, since the German authorities -- he was a German and he came from the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> which was in <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> , he tried to speak Polish and he learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">He tried to learn Polish, and when I came to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> he said, the German authorities gave me six <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span> on this <span class="DLF">street</span> -- because he lived he had his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> there and he lived there as well, for administration, and he said, well, my practice doesn't permit me to spend much time on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">He said, somebody has to administer these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">The administration, what it meant to collect the rent and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">If there were any repairs, to have the repairs done. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I was already a member of the resistance and I didn't want to be accused of collaborating with the Germans or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So I went to my organization and I told them that I was offered this job. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">What do they think? </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Whether it is okay for me to take? </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Because I mean I had to live and I didn't have any other means. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">So they said yes, that is okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">You can administer. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So I took the job and I administered these six <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and there was the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I lived there and the next few <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And later on the doctor got in touch with me and he said, you know what, he said, the German authorities want me to take under administration 10,000 houses of Jewish, confiscated Jewish property because most -- well, most, I don't know whether most, but many of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were owned -- <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> were owned by Jews -- and he said they were all confiscated and they had to be administered and he said, what do you think? </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Shall I under take? </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And I said, well, I didn't think about him that he couldn't do it, but 1t would give jobs to many Poles who could do it and have a job and means to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So I said, yes, why not. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">He said, do you think I will get these people to -- and I said, I'm sure you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">You will have to advertise and you will get many people to try and help you administer these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , which he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">He did advertise. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Matter of fact, my brother-in-law was a lawyer himself but he was in the prisoner of war camp, but some of his friends knew me and met me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And matter of fact, they came to me, whether I couldn't help them get these jobs and they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">They did get, and the 10,000 Jewish property was administered mostly by Pole, and Dr. Eichner had to have a big staff and he employed one lawyer, also a Polish lawyer who had to do all the hiring and all the -- and Dr. Eichner also had a girlfriend who was Polish, and after my arrest -- I left later on -- learned that he was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">He was executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Now, there were rumors that the Gestapo, because he was so friendly towards Poles, that he was executed by them. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Other version is that he was executed by the resistance because he had, you know, he had Polish girlfriends. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Also, he was a married man but his wife didn't live with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">His wife remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">So I don't know what the truth 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I wasn't there so I don't know exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I met this one girlfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">It was quite on accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">When I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> in 1945, I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> and I came to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and as I, as I walked into the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> I saw this girl, there. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I recognized her right away and I said, what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And they told me the story about Eichner and I said, how did you get out? </span><span class="sentence" id="314">She was actually Ukrainian, or he made her Ukrainian. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">He gave her a Ukrainian pass, because to be Polish and he associating with Polish girls was not in the best interest of his, and it didn't look very nicely with the German authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">So he made her Ukrainian. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Actually, her father I think was a white Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">He was a white Russian and he was running away from the Communist, and when I met her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , her parents were with her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> and how they got out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , because during the war, you know, as it was -- <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was one of the axis members.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="322">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">The rent money went to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">He was getting 10 percent of the take. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Say if there was 2000 zwate (ph) he got 200. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">You know, it was 10 percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">The 10 percent we split 50/50. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">In other words, he gave me 5 percent and he took 5 percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">That was the deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">That was the deal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">QUESTION:  Where did the rest of the money go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">ANSWER:  Oh, to the German authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Yes, I had to put it in a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I had to put it in a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> and from this <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> I only deposited 90 percent and the 10 percent went split between 50/50 -- 5 percent to me and 5 percent to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">That was my money. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">That's how it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">But after he got the other 10,000 <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , I don't know how it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">The <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> thing, I don't know what the deal was. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">This was private because he lived on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were all on this one <span class="DLF">street</span> , you know, where he lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  You mean it was a private deal between him and the German authorities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">ANSWER:  I suppose so, yes, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">The other deals with 10,000 <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , that was probably a separate deal, a different deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And how it was worked I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  Why don't we begin with -- if you could just give me the date, and the unopening of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and just start at that point and describe to me what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">ANSWER:  Well, when they opened the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> it was now April the 5, 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">We were driven out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and put in rows of five and twenty rows of five made a hundred prisoners, and the next hundred and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And then we were surrounded by the guards and with the dogs and marched. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">We marched maybe 15, 20 minutes and then we came to a <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Of course, we still didn't know where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">We came to a <span class="DLF">gate</span> and on top of the <span class="DLF">gate</span> there was a sign which read " ", which means, "Work will make you free". </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And on the side later on we found out it was the <span class="BUILDING">guardhouse</span> on the side, there was a sign which read <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">KL Auschwitz</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="353">KL" stands for concentration-slager (ph) <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and then of course, we knew we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , the place we dreaded most. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And they opened the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , we marched in and we were met by some, as I said, sinister looking characters, you know, in navy caps, something like marines, I mean sailors ware and navy blue jackets and stripe trousers with high boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Later on we found out that this was the German Elderstedt(ph) which means he was camp senior and he was a German criminal prisoner and his name was number one. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">His name as I mentioned before was Bruno Brounee(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="357">He wore a yellow armband with black lettering on which is it says, ---Elderstedt, and then there was some other, you know, prisoners in striped uniforms with armbands. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Some had block elderstedt which means block senior, and we were marched to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">There we had to undress and we were shaved all over our bodies including our heads, and then we had to go into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> which was full of some chemicals, disinfectants, we had to submerge in it, and then from there we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> and we had to wash, and when we came out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> , we had to put our civilian clothes, because when we came from the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> we were still 1n civilian clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">We had to -- 1t was packed in a bag, in a paper bag with our number. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Of course, we didn't have the number then but after the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> then we were issued prison uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">We got long underwear, striped, you know, blue and white stripes but very, very narrow underwear, and then we received striped, one-inch white striped, white and blue trousers and jackets and a cap, also striped. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Then we were issued to swatches of white cloth with a number. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">My number was 13390 and two red triangles. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">A red triangle indicated that we were political prisoners, and these, these numbers and the triangles we later on had to sew on our jackets on the left hand side of the jacket, the triangle first, and underneath the number and on the right hand side of the trouser leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Again, the triangle at the top and the number at the bottom, and the numbers were assigned also to the our civilian clothes which we had to pack in a bag which was then stored in a special <span class="INT_SPACE">storage rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And then again, we were put -- I don't know, with a 100 or 50 or what, and we were taken over by a block elderstedt, it means a block senior. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And the block senior walked us to the <span class="DLF">block</span> and we were assigned to <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I remember my block assignment was number seven, and at that time the numbering changed constantly because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was in constant construction. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">You know, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was the former <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> of a Polish artillery unit, prewar artillery unit, and this sight was chosen, you know, for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And this block number seven was a one-story <span class="BUILDING">brick building</span> and the block elder, his name was -- well, I don't know his name but he was called "Bloody Alloys". </span><span class="sentence" id="372">His first name was Alloys, "Bloody Alloys". </span><span class="sentence" id="373">He wore also a red triangle and he came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sacknow(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="374">He was a German apparently, a German Communist but he was the most brutal person one can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">To kill for him, a prisoner didn't mean anything and that's why he was called "Bloody Alloys", and we were taken to this <span class="DLF">block</span> and I was assigned to -- there were only four <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> on this <span class="DLF">block</span> and this huge <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , I don't know the size, but probably maybe 50 feet by 20 or so, a huge <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and in charge of each <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was a room elder, and most of them were already Polish prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">The block elder were all Germans and I was assigned to this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and he was a Polish fellow, I forgot his name, and we had -- there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">There was only in one part of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there was a pile of straw and next to it were few blankets and in the night the straw was spread over the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and we had to lie there, one next to another in many rows, and we had the blankets one blanket maybe for three prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And in the morning we were- well, the day started, you know, at dawn to dusk, and even before the dawn we had to get up and we had to run out of the <span class="DLF">block</span> in front of the <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">There were small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span> , wooden pails of water and everybody had to wash in this water. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">You know, maybe 10, 20 prisoners washed in the same water. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">You just splashed your -- there was no means of cleaning your teeth or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And then you got in the morning, you got half a liter of some liquid which they called either coffee or te
ANSWER:  It looked, maybe it had the color of coffee or the color of tea but it was some substitute. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">That's all you got in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Then you went to work and there were three roll calls at that time I came, three roll calls of the prisoners a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">One was in the morning and one was at noontime and one was in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">After the morning tea you went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Those like myself, when I first came, were assigned of course, to the worst possible jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">You know, you had to dig for the foundations. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I myself had to carry the wheelbarrows full of earth some 300 yards away. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And all the work had to be done on the double, and you had to run with it, and while you were running with this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelbarrow</span> you were shouted at and beaten and then you had to come back and get another load. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And again, you know, and the foremens they were mostly all Germans at that time and they beat you for no reason whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And of course, doing such exhaustive work, you just couldn't do it you know for long. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">At one time I was also assigned to a <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> where I had to chop wood and saw wood and you were exposed to the elements, whether rain or shine you know, snow or not, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">You just had to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Now, at noontime we did get a liter of soup and the soup was watery soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Mostly, I remember for a long time we had nothing but turnip soup and very seldom did you see a piece of potato and not to mention meat or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And in the evening we received one third of a loaf of bread, dark bread, and we received a small cube of margarine, you know, the size which you get in the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">We also got a slice maybe a quarter of an inch wide slice of sausage, you know, second quality sausage and a teaspoon of substitute marmalade and also this coffee or tea or whatever they called, and that was our food for the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I don't know how many calories it was, but it was starvation, rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And I myself always ate the bread and I never saved it for the morning because many times, prisoners who did save, their bread was stolen and then they didn't have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So I ate mine in the evening and didn't leave anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Never ate any - didn't have any bread in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And now, the punishment, if they caught you stealing other prisoners bread and you were caught, it was a death sentence. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">You were killed, you know, either the room elder or the block elder told a Kapo because when you went to work, you went under different, you know, the Kapos were in charge of you and they told that this fellow stole bread from another prisoner he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">They brought him back from work, you know, dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">That was an unwritten rule in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> you never stole from another prisoner because you deprived him of his livelihood. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So --
QUESTION:  Tell me about the different triangles?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">ANSWER:  Oh yes, there were six main colors of triangles indicating the different kind of prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">As I said the red was the political prisoners and most of the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Then there was a triangle, a red triangle on top of a yellow triangle but reversed so that it formed the Star of David. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">This was the designation of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">There were Jews, you know, at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">At the beginning there were in small numbers but there were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Then there was a green triangle indicated the criminal prisoner and they were mostly, mostly Germans, and then there was a black triangle which indicated an antisocial element, like in cases of woman and, you know, prostitutes and men, pimps and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Then there was a pink triangle which indicated homosexuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Then there was a lavender color which indicated bible scientists, you know, those who were opposed to war, pacifists and so on, Jehovah witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">They were this lavender, purple color. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">They were most, I would say, decently treated of all the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">So this was the main six different colors of triangles. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">With the Jews it was the Star of David, two triangles, you know, reversed on the yellow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">QUESTION:  And the Jews were right with you at beginning?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">We all were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">We all were on one <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">There was no difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Later on when the big numbers of Jews started coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , actually to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">They were mostly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Now, maybe I should tell you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">You know how what constituted <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , really? </span><span class="sentence" id="430"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> there were three main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="431">One was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz One</span> , which was the camp it was called Stamlager(ph) or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maztda(ph) camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Then there was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz Two</span> , which I would say a mile and a half away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz One</span> , and this was a huge <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="433">The capacity of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz One</span> where I was was probably 30,000, maybe over 30,000 prisoners but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau camp</span> was built to hold 200,000 prisoners, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> also had a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">womens camp</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">mens camp</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">gypsies camp</span> because there were gypsies, were all wooden <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Actually, they were horse barracks for the German Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">There were no <span class="DLF">windows</span> in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">woman camp</span> were brick <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and it was only one-story <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and I visited. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I was able to visit it once and the conditions there were appalling, absolutely appalling The mud was more than ankle deep, you know, and the poor women. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">You know, they wore wooden shoes and they came, opened here, actually slippers, like wooden slippers. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">They lost them, you know, they were losing them in the mud. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">They couldn't get them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">It was just -- the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , they were just unbelievable, you know, filth. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">It's still standing now. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I mean, I visited the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> a few times since I, you know, after the war and it's still standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Birkenau mens camp 1s not because it was all wooden and somebody set fire to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Only the <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> are standing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">QUESTION:  How did you happen to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">womens camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">ANSWER:  I worked in the workshops and I was -- later on, you know, I went to work as a carpenter. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I mean, I was no carpenter but they took me later on to work in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in the carpentry. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Later on I was you could say I was promoted and I became the chief clerk of all workshops, which consisted of the electricians, you know, locksmiths, carters, joiners, glassers, roofers, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">All the trades were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">So I became the chief clerk of this and later on I became also -- they transferred me from the <span class="BUILDING">workshop</span> itself to the central <span class="BUILDING">construction offices</span> , which where, they employed architects, engineers, draftsman and I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">The workshops had their own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Matter of fact, I was sitting with an SS man and a civilian German, and as such I was able to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because I asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I wanted to see the conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">The different craftsmen had to go to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> if there repairs to be made. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">For instance, if something went wrong with the electricity or something needed to be done by the joiners or by the carpenters. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I was able, once there was a need to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , I asked -- well, I didn't ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">The fellow in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> another clerk, a friend of mine with whom I escaped, he made out a pass and he put my name and I went with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And the SS who took us, because you couldn't go there without a guard, didn't care which prisoner he took, whether I was a real craftsman or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">That was how I was able to go and I saw the conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">That's the only one time I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">But there were many other people like carpenters, electricians and so on and who went daily, and they were telling, you know, about conditions that were. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">So that's how I was able to go there and see. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Now, let's see, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Now, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was in constant, in constant <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , so when I first came I was on <span class="BUILDING">Block 7</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">This <span class="DLF">block</span> later on was raised and another story was put up on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">So later on it became Number 14 and later on it became number, <span class="BUILDING">Block Number 22</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And there were 28 <span class="DLF">blocks</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">mother camp</span> , 28 blocks, and they went from | to on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , to 11. </span><span class="sentence" id="469"><span class="BUILDING">Block 11</span> was called the <span class="DLF">death block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">It was the <span class="DLF">bunker block</span> and there was a <span class="DLF">yard</span> and there was a <span class="DLF">wall</span> , <span class="DLF">death wall</span> against in which prisoners were shot in the back of the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> , there were <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> , standing <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> where four people. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">The <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> was three feet by three feet and there was only a <span class="DLF">door</span> at the bottom of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">The prisoners had to crawl in and stand up and four of the prisoner in this small - were locked up for the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I think there were six of such standing <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Mostly, they were put there without any food and then only the bodies were pulled out from there and burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And there were other <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> and other instruments of torture where people went - anybody who went to <span class="BUILDING">Block 11</span> seldom came out alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Now, the woman come at one time - it was actually in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">You know the 11 <span class="DLF">blocks</span> which were on the eastern side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> were all partitioned, with barbwire, and this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">womens camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And then the conditions there for the women were quite quite decent, but it didn’t last long because they were only put there until they build a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And once this was built, then they went back there. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Also after invasion of the Russian on June 22, 1941, I don’t know exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I think either it was in October or November, the part of 9 <span class="DLF">blocks</span> was separated again by barbwire and the <span class="DLF">gate</span> was put on and on this <span class="DLF">gate</span> they wrote that a prisoner of war camp and the Russian prisoners were brought there. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And there were approximately 11,000 of them and out of the 11,000 by, I think, December of that year only maybe a thousand survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">The rest were all dead and most of them were dead by starvation and by typhus and by beatings. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And the bodies of these Russian prisoners were stuck six feet high because there was no - they didn’t have the capacity to burn the bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">The one <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> which was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz One</span> was the smallest of all the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> and it just couldn’t burn the bodies, you know, fast enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">There was also a <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> - next to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was a small <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> where people were gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Of course, the biggest <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz Two</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">There were this <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was designated as Number | and then there were Number 2, 3, 4 and 5 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , and there the capacity was much greater, much greater, especially the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">They had the capacity of 2000 or even more prisoners or people could be gassed 1n one sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And there were four of them so it’s approximately 10,000 people could be gassed in, well, matter of few hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">The gassing was not the problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">The problem was the disposing of the bodies because the capacity of the ovens were quite limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">That’s why many of the bodies were burned in <span class="DLF">ditches</span> or they were burned on stacks and disposed this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Now, since we were about gassing, the first gassing actually took place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschqitz camp</span> itself and it was the gassing of some 600 Russian prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">We - and some Polish prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">One day, it was of course after the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> by Hitler, I think it was approximately on, in September, I think, September of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">We were all called back from our <span class="BUILDING">workplaces</span> to the camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Maybe I should also explain how the compound itself was only for the prisoners to go for the night to sleep, and the compound - as I said in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz One</span> was 28 blocks and it was surrounded by two rows of barbedwire, electrified barbwire and by <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> with guards with machine guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">On the <span class="REGION">east side</span> , east and south side there was also maybe 15 high - maybe not 15 - maybe 10 feet high <span class="DLF">concrete wall</span> because next to the east was a <span class="DLF">road</span> , <span class="DLF">public road</span> , which of course, they didn’t want anybody to see the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and from the south. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And I lost my thought now - yes - so we were all brought back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> one afternoon, and we had to go on the <span class="DLF">blocks</span> and they told us that we, nobody can go to the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and look out the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Anybody who will be caught will be killed and the guards were all over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and we didn’t know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">We found out later on the next days because the pallbearers told us, you know, there were prisoners who had to remove the bodies and apparently, 600 Russian prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And I don’t know, I think they were all officers and most of them probably were all political commisars [ph] and they were taken to <span class="BUILDING">Block 11</span> , the <span class="DLF">death block</span> , and they were put into the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> were sealed off. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">There were half <span class="DLF">windows</span> and the half <span class="DLF">windows</span> were covered with dirt in order to make them gas tight and they were gassed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And in the night the bodies were removed by the pallbearers and taken to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> Number | in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and they were burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And from the pallbearers we learned that they were Russian officers or soldiers, and among them there were also some 200 Polish prisoners that were gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">So that was the first gassing, as I, which was performed. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Later on, there were gassings in the small <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and I once was witness, I mean, not to the gassing itself because nobody - only the prisoners who worked - but the <span class="DLF">block</span> I was on was Number 22 later on, which was the nearest to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">You couldn’t see the whole of the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Only part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">You could only see the <span class="DLF">foreyard</span> , you know, to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">There was a <span class="DLF">gate</span> and then there was a small <span class="DLF">yard</span> and to this from our <span class="DLF">windows</span> where we were at the far end of this <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">I saw myself a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> arrive and back out to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> to the small <span class="DLF">yard</span> and Jews had to - only men - they arrive from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and were put into the <span class="DLF">yard</span> and there they had to undress. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Now, how do I know they were Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Because, because they were Hasidic Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">They wore special dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">You know, mostly black, black hats and most of them had beards. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Later on, we also found out from the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> people who had to burn the bodies that there were Jews from the Polish city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bendzin</span> , which was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syvicia</span> [ph] not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and these people had to undress and they disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I couldn’t see that, but they all went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> there and they were gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Now, as I worked in the carpentry a time and then in the <span class="BUILDING">workshops</span> you know I had to take orders and the orders came to me, and I had to distribute the orders to the different <span class="BUILDING">workshops</span> , you know whether it was an order for the locksmiths or an order for the carpenters or for the glassers or for the electricians and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Well, there were orders coming, for instance, for gas-tight <span class="DLF">doors</span> and there were drawings, you know, how the <span class="DLF">doors</span> should look. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">What it should look like, and the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were approximately three inches, maybe three and a half inches thick, and they were - were insulated <span class="NPIP">inside</span> with some gas proof material. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I don’t know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I think it was wool, some wool, and then the edges, the edges of the <span class="DLF">door</span> , they were this way, and the edges were then felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">You know, how do you say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">QUESTION:  Padded?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And in the middle of the <span class="DLF">door</span> was a visor open, you know, with glass from both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Because as I said, the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were three, three and a half inches thick. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And there were two bolts and through this - and then the way when they gave the order read, Fear for “Zander ber hablen der Juden” [ph]. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">It means for special treatment of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">There never was. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I never came across where they talked about Final Solution. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">They always referred to it as “Zander ber hablen der Juden”’ [ph], the special treatment of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Of course, we knew it was the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Final Solution. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So these <span class="DLF">doors</span> - somebody today tries to say that it didn’t exist, so why did you need gas-tight <span class="DLF">doors</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Anyway, anybody who wants to deny this, either ignore it or - Now -
QUESTION:  How many of those <span class="DLF">doors</span> were there? </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Were there many?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">ANSWER:  Quite a few because the first <span class="DLF">door</span> was done for the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> for the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and then there were the other ones were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I don’t know how many altogether, but at least, as far as I know, probably were at least five. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Five <span class="DLF">doors</span> and I’m now sorry because when I when back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> - I had to keep a register, a big book where I had to register every order which came in had to be registered and it was my job, and I, when I went back I’m sure had I seen it right away I would have taken it with me, and then from there you would be able to find out how many <span class="DLF">doors</span> there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">But I remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Matter of fact, if I had drawing board or something I could draw exactly you know what the <span class="DLF">door</span> looked like because I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I remember it so well. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">So, but now maybe you want to ask --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Why don’t I ask you - you mentioned an incident about Russian POWs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I wanted to say yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I was witness because at that time I became a clerk on the <span class="DLF">block</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">QUESTION:  And it was <span class="BUILDING">Block 25</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">ANSWER:  25A was right next to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">camp kitchen</span> , and at that time there was a small <span class="DLF">yard</span> in front of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and one day and it was in the morning, you know, when all the commanders went to work and only on the <span class="DLF">blocks</span> were the block elder and the people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> you know and the clerk, and we saw through the <span class="DLF">window</span> , because it was on the second, yes the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> , we were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> , that the SS brought out <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> , and there were some papers on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">We knew something was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Later on, they brought maybe 100, I don’t know exactly, 100 men. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Now, they were stripped to the waist but you could see from the trousers that they were soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">As I said, later on we did find out that they were Russian soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">It as also after the invasion, after the June 22, 1941, I think it was in August, and they, they were registered or questioned or whatever the SS - nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Again, we couldn’t go, you couldn’t be conspicuous and look through the <span class="DLF">window</span> , you know, with your nose next to the pane. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">You couldn’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">You could only do it from afar. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">They were taking some evidence of them and later on they were taken to a <span class="DLF">sand pit</span> which was behind the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Already outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span> near the <span class="BUILDING">guardhouse</span> there was a <span class="DLF">sand pit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">The sand was used you know for construction. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">They were taken out and the SS, only the SS, and the most vicious way they were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">They were killed by -- and this I saw with my own eyes - they were killed by being hit by spades as they split their heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">They were told to lie down and they put the handles of the spades on over their throat and they stood on each end of it and they suffocated them. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And they were put on the edge of the <span class="DLF">pit</span> and then kicked in the groin and they fell down, and they took big stones and they through them. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Of course, I couldn’t see because they were down in the <span class="DLF">pit</span> but I saw the SS throwing the big stones on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">They they did - there was a small narrow-gauged <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> which they loaded the sand to be taken to the <span class="DLF">construction site</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">They loaded this with the sand then they told the prisoners to lie down next to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">These <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> were, they could turn over and then they turned over and the whole load of sand was put, and they buried them alive, and that I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And that was the most horrible thing I ever saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Now, I couldn’t tell and nobody really knew, at that time, they probably killed half of these hundred men before noon. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Then of course, they had to go to lunch, the SS, and after lunch they killed the rest of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">They were all killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">They were not shot or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">They were murdered in the most brutal way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">QUESTION:  By a small handful of SS or - how many SS were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="581">ANSWER:  I couldn’t tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I just don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Not too many SS men. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Not too many. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And we learned or we heard that they were also commisars you know and some of them, at least to me, some of them looked, had Semitic features. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">So maybe they were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Because the viciousness which they displayed, the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Just, you can’t imagine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">QUESTION:  You told another incident where you mentioned a pretty heroic act by Father Colby?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Father Colby, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I was on the <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="594">It was in quite soon when I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Of course, I didn’t know Father Colby then. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I didn’t know from Adam. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Nobody really knew who you were. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">You were all - unless you had close friends you know whom you knew from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> before you went to - otherwise, you didn’t know who your next neighbor was or so unless you got friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Anyway, a prisoner escaped and at that time there was a collective responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">If a prisoner escaped and say he escaped from say, work unit, or he was stationed on this <span class="DLF">block</span> , then they were taking hostages, you know, mostly 10 or 20 hostages for the escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And in this instance, the prisoner escaped and the camp commandant - not the camp commandant - the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> what is the different? </span><span class="sentence" id="602">He was the camp only of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Not the top commandant. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">His name was Fritcher [?] </span><span class="sentence" id="605">and he came, you know, after the roll call in the evening, came through - because this prisoner was stationed on our <span class="DLF">block</span> , on this <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And he came to select the ten hostages, and he went one row through, you know, we had to stand in ten rows. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">When one row through another and I don’t know what decided him but he picked out, he said, you step out. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">He looked you in the eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">He looked in my eye and passed me up and looked in somebody else’s eyes and you know anyway, he selected ten at that time, ten prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And one of the selected prisoner was a Polish sergeant in the army who was married and he had children, and he was lamenting that he’ ll never will see his children or his wife, and at that moment a man stepped out and said that he would like to take his <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you know, to save him. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And the commandant agreed and this fellow went back into the row and survived and the other man died of starvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And later on, we found out - of course, at that time I didn’t know it was Father Colby who was later on canonized and I think he’s now, you know maybe he’s already a Saint, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And the fellow whose <span class="NPIP">place</span> he took, his name was Guy Ovneczech [ph] and he survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I don’t know whether he’s still alive or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">This was, that was the incident and I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Yes, I do remember it vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Well, you know when first of all, when we came, this commandant was Fritcher. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">When we arrived he also had a big speech to us all and it was translated by a translator and of course, he spoke in German and he said, “‘you are here for the duration of the war.” </span><span class="sentence" id="619">That’s what he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And the next sentence he said, “The only way out of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> is with the smoke through the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="621">So once he said this, we all felt that the whole world collapsed you know around us because there was no really - it was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">There was no really escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">The only escape was through the smoke of the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> and of course, for many Jews that was the only way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">QUESTION:  In any of the work that you did, did anyone do any sabotage or any resistance?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">ANSWER:  Well, not that I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">No - nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I can tell you this, the terror was extreme. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">We lived in constant fear and because you never were sure you know what the next moment can bring, that was, to me anyway, it was the biggest - the uncertainty. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">The uncertainty in the life. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , you know you could have been safe in your work because you worked and the SS man in charge may have been quite decent you know treating you, but once you came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , you didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there was so called political department you know which was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp’s</span> Gestapo, and you didn’t know what they had in mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">If you, for instance, if you, the worst thing 1s when you went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Say you were sick and you were emaciated. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">They took you to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> because they didn’t want to waste food on you anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I tell you the ways of killing people. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">There were the mass killings. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Well, the gassing was the biggest one. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Then there was the injection where they injected you, you know in the heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">They injected you with with phenol, you know, chemical which causes instant death. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Then there were of course, the execution by shooting you know you were shot in the back of your head at the <span class="DLF">death wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">But before the <span class="DLF">death wall</span> was built, the shootings were executions by firing squads and it was done in the, again in the <span class="DLF">sand pits</span> and <span class="DLF">gravel pits</span> you know outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and many times at the evening roll call when we stood at the roll call, the prisoners were taken out of the <span class="DLF">death block</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Block 11</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">At one time it was Number 13, but the numbers were constantly were changing. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">But they had bound their hands with wires in the back of them and they walked through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to the <span class="DLF">pit</span> , <span class="DLF">gravel pit</span> behind the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and then they were shot by firing squads. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">That was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Later on, they were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I don’t know for what reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Maybe it was they wasted too much time. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">They were shot just against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> in the <span class="DLF">death yard</span> against the <span class="DLF">death wall</span> , and they were shot from a small caliber rifle and they were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Always, one of the prisoners took the victims who had to be shot by the arms, you know one on left arm and right arm and led them towards the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , and the SS man who, the executioner came from the back and shot the fist one and then the other one, and then they were thrown on the <span class="DLF">piles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Matter of fact, this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> was soaked with blood two meters deep because it was - afterwards, when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was liberated they dug it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">They had to dig two meters deep to get the blood out of this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And how many were shot? </span><span class="sentence" id="653">The one, the one person it was Hapchar [ph]. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I think his first name was Gearhart. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">He was also the Report Fuhrer and he was also the executioner, and you could see him at the time when I was the clerk on the <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="656">You saw him with his rifle under his arm walking to the <span class="BUILDING">Block 11</span> which meant that there would be execution, and the executions were almost daily, daily, every day, one way or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Either, well later on, the gassing was every day and there were shootings were every day and the injections were given almost daily, and you could see him going. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">In other words, one knew that there would be execution, and the small caliber rifle was used because it didn’t make too much sound. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">It wasn’t very loud and apparently it must have been very effective. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And there were others who did the executions. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">There was another Report Fuhrer, his name was Kadook [ph]. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Matter of fact, he was -- . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Now apparently, he got into trouble with the authorities and he was later on sent to - that’s what I hear - now, this is only from hearing, I have no knowledge otherwise - that apparently his family, his wife and two children were bombed and killed in bombing raids, and he apparently got friendly with a Jewess in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau camp</span> and he was found out, and then he was sent to fight the Partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Because of his great services which he rendered to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German camp</span> he was not executed or anything but he was sent to fight the Partisans in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">So that’s what we heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And this other - Kadook was first caught and he was tried in <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> , he was sentenced to death but then it was commuted to life, and afterwards he was given - because there were other things which they try him in <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> , and he was taken to <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> and tried again. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And I think the trial went for many, many years, and there were many witnesses called from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and I don’t know whether he 1s free or whether he 1s still in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I think that was one of the last trials that was conducted. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">End of Tape #2 Tape #3
QUESTION:  Tell me what it meant to be one of the older prisoners in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Tell me about life expectancy in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="672">ANSWER:  Well, life expectancy of a prisoner, of a new arrival was between two to three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">It depended of course, upon the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">If you had a very heavy and of course, new arrivals always got worst jobs, the heaviest jobs, like digging on the foundations and carrying bricks and very heavy duties. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">On the food which we received they couldn’t exist longer than two three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">So if you were lucky, like I suppose I was, that I did you know meet a friend of mine who was already established prisoner, because he came with the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and was able to get a job as a groom to the SS horses, officer’s horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And therefore, he was able to share some of the food which the horses recetved, which was more than the prisoners did, like potatos and carrots, and even sugar even though the sugar was discolored, they had means of cleaning it, they could survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And because of them I was able to survive because they introduced me to the carpentry, master of carpentry and I was able to get and work in the <span class="BUILDING">carpentry shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">But other people who were unable and who had to work these hard, you know, labors just couldn’t possible survive more than two, three months, and those who were emaciated were called Muslim man and the were - they lost all will to life and they walked you know like in a daze and you could - with one finger you could push them and they fell over and never got up. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">It was a terrible sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And one of my friends - matter of fact, we came together, who was arrested with me - he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">He didn’t survive, and I met him once and I couldn’t do anything for to help him. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">He died. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">He became a Muslim man and perished.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">QUESTION:  So, if you had lived for a long time you gained respect?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">The respect was in the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">The German guards respected anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Well, respected - they had a certain respect because they saw that anybody was able to survive three months, and say and longer, then he must be a person of strong character and strong will and good physical condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">So they did they had certain respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I would say, yes they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And of course, there was among prisoners - when you were an old prisoner you were also trusted. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">That if you survived the first few months, that you must be of good character and be able to conduct yourself in a manner. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Now, there were, of course, some prisoners who did survive because of their brutality. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Not only all were German criminal prisoners who were in charge, you know Kapos and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Later on matter of fact, I think when the German war machine was slowing down and they called up some of the German prisoners, the German prisoners were called up to the German Army and they apparently formed some special units. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">So the Kapos later on and the block elders became, they were eighter Polish or Czech or - there were also some Jewish in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="698">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> there were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Now, some behaved honorably and some didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">There were, like one of the prisoners in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I camp who did the injections you know killing, was a Polish prisoner who did this. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">His name was Pineschhk [ph]. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Everybody knew about it but nobody could do - what happened, he was transferred later on to another camp and then he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">So these were the unwritten rules you know of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="704">That you better behave yourself because eventually somebody will get you. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And there was another prisoner, who 1s also tried and I told about this Kadook [ph] Report Fuhrer - he was a block elder in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz One</span> and later on he became a block leader in the punishment company. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Because there was a company where you went as a punishment and you seldom came out once you went to this company. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And he behaved badly and he was arrested in <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> and tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I don’t know what the result was, whether he’s free now or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">So there were, you know, there were many prisoners - and there were many informers among the prisoners, and there were not only German informers there were Polish informers. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">It was a fight for survival and some did it by honest means and others couldn’t care less how they achieved this. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">So --, but I would say anybody who survived for a long time was trusted, and that’s how, for instance, we could arranged our escape from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because we knew all the prisoners and we trusted them and when they trusted us, and we more or less knew who the informers were. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Once you were that long in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> you knew whom to avoid and whom not. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Whom you could trust and whom you could speak and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Could I tell you that I contracted typhus?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">QUESTION:  Yes, but I think we should - let’s do typhus and then go on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">ANSWER:  One time - well, typhus was always but there was an epidemic in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">There was a great epidemic of typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">It was the spotted fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I contracted it and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , what they called the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">It was so bad that later on, you know, we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> and there they were three-tier <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">There were also three-tier <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> and they were approximately three feet wide and on them, many times, three prisoners, three sick people had to lie. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And, two this way and one in the legs, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">So it was terrible, and I contracted it too and I was for 16 days in high fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I never apparently - my constitution was quite good and I didn’t lose consciousness, but I didn’t eat through the whole 16 days and all I did get was hot water, boiled water to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And then I was for the next three weeks in convalescence, and then I was released one afternoon, but I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Maybe I had a friend, doctor whom I knew and the friend doctor, it was Dr. Tyfeld [ph] he - after I got out and was in convalescence, he gave me two injections of glucose. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">That’s the only medication I did get, to strengthen me. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And then, as I said, one afternoon I was released, and the reason for it I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Maybe the doctor knew something or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">I was released in the afternoon and I was so happy that I was now out of the - and I tried to run and I didn’t realize how weak I was and I couldn’t lift my feet, and I fell nght on my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And then I went on the <span class="DLF">block</span> and the next morning around, I think, six o’clock in the morning or seven o’clock, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and all the patients, whether in convalescence or sick were loaded on these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and taken to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and they were all gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And they were not all Jewish, you know Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">There were Christians and Poles, and Czechs, many different nationalities, and they were all dead and all taken and gassed, and I avoided it just by well some 12, 13 hours, you know I avoided being gassed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">QUESTION:  You don’t know if somebody saved you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">ANSWER:  I don’t know, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Maybe the doctor knew and they released me. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I was the only one released and I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">But I suppose it was fate or somebody just knew something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">QUESTION:  Sometime around late in 1943, I think it was that you decided, even though escape was impossible, that you would look into that. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Tell me what happened, how it led into that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="741">ANSWER:  Well, you know, I was thinking about escaping. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">As a matter of fact, the first day I was arrested when I was taken to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and we were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">entrance hall</span> , I already thought then that I just walk out because I did speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I thought maybe I be able to talk myself out and I wanted to go to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">But I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">I didn’t know enough, you know, how the workings of it were. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">But then when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> at the beginning, I didn’t think it because, you know, you were so hungry and you just couldn’t gather your thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">All you were thinking about how to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">But later on when I, more or less, became acquainted and I got together with a friend of mine and we were thinking about escaping, and we did have a plan and we did prepare for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And of course, the preparations were you had to do it with and had to involve many people and trust many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Now, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there were some crafts which couldn’t be performed by prisoners because they were specialties things which had to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And therefore, they did employ outside people from the Polish workers, and these workers were more or less free to mingle you know with the prisoners and some people did mingle with them and were able to talk and exchange information from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and some of them were even able to send letters to their family from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Some were caught and if the civilian person was caught, then they were brought to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or they were executed right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">So they were taking great chances. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">But anyway, so we did - one of the fellows made the contact, there were four of us who planned to escape, and we wanted to escape as civilian workers and we did prepare, you know, the passes. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">They were of course forged and our photographs were drawings you know and then taken - the photographs by a lens and somebody in a box. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">Somebody brought a lens and we made a photograph of this drawings. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Not of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Couldn’t be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And then that’s what we put on the passes and then the civilians also brought <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , and what they did, they came on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> in this <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="760">It was in not carpentry. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">It was in the joiners. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">There were small <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they could be hidden you know, in the joiners, and they left them and they brought four because four of us wanted to escape, and they brought four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="763">They also brought four civilian clothes and they also - we were able to prepare toupees, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">They were very crudely made. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I don’t know who made them, but anyway there were, and then we decided that we going to go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">At that time when we planned, you know, there was no more collective responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">In other words, nobody would have suffered because of our escape and that’s what - we didn’t want anybody to be starved to death because we escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">We didn’t think in those terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">We thought that if we do, we didn’t want anybody to suffer for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">So when the day came that we escaped, we wanted to go with the other workers and could mingle and go in one group and then show the passes. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And I’m sure the guards wouldn’t check each pass separately, you know closely, and when the day and the time to quit, which was the worker had to leave by five o’clock, we went to the <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="772">It was a <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> where we changed the clothes, into the civilian, and this one fellow who actually made all the contacts with the civilians because he was in a position to do it, he just didn’t show up in the <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> to change. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">So then one of my friends you know changed back into the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and went to see what is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And then he came and he was shaking life a leaf and he just couldn’t contain himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">He was mumbling. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">He said, I’m sorry I can’t make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">He said, I cannot do it, I just can’t take the risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">So then we had to abandon it. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And we again changed into our prison garb, and now we were afraid about him, whether he is not going to you know to tell on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And we had to, well - we could have, if we wanted we could have eliminated him by - because of the lies, we could have infected him with typhus you know and he knew it and if he once he went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , you know, the doctors were all Polish or Jewish and Czechs or what and they were friends of ours, they would have taken care of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">But he promised us, he cannot do it but he 1s not going to do any harm to us if we want to go in a different way. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">He said to trust him and we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">We did trust him and we had to change our plans, and then apparently, apparently somebody must have known that we were planning to escape, and then the other group came and they approached us with - we wouldn’t go in a different way, and the different way was to acquire SS uniforms and take prisoners out to work outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And that’s how we started planning, and some of the people who were involved had connections. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">One of the prisoners had connections with the people, because everywhere I worked were prisoners, everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Only the top authorities were the Germans, but otherwise, the inside organization of it was all, in the prisoners hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">There were all in the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> , everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">The whole evidence, everything, was kept by the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Doctors, you know, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">So we decided that we do escape as SS guards and take four prisoners out to work, outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And since my friend and myself spoke quite decent German, we were picked to be the SS people. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">And then some of the friends who were involved had friends who worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">storage rooms</span> where they stored the SS uniforms and they were able to smuggle out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">storage rooms</span> one pair of trousers and then second pair of trousers, and then one jacket and another one, then a cap, then second cap, then the belt, then second belt, and this was brought in and it was stored, you know, my friends who was supposed to change in the SS uniform with me who had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">He was a carver and a sculptor and he had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> , and he was not bothered by anybody, by the SS, because he worked for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">He sculpted things for them for which they sometimes give him some bread and some sausage and, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And they took these things and probably sold it or kept it, sent it to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="796">So we stored it in his small <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> , and then when the time came to escape, then we transferred it to the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Actually, it was not only a <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> but it was all the building materials were stored, in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="798">It was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bowhov</span> [?] </span><span class="sentence" id="799">and in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where the lumber was kept there were three friends of ours and they hid the uniforms there. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And these uniforms, they then put the insignia because we didn’t want to go out as just ordinary SS men. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">We wanted to go as NCOs in order that we were able to carry sidearms. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Of course, any SS man who was taking out people to work <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , you know, had to be armed. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Not only armed, had to have a special permit, but I’Il come back later to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">The arms of course, was an impossibility for us to obtain, but we again, had friends who worked in the saddlery that, you know, workshops, and we were able to obtain two holsters for which we then made dummy pistols out of wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Now, one of our friends knew somebody in the saddlery and he approached him with a concocted story that the chief of the carpenters and workshops, who was an SS man by the name of Ifred Shiner [ph] had his birthday coming up, and his holster was rather shabby, and whether he wouldn’t make a new holster for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">The fellow said, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Of course, everything was done for a piece of bread or piece of sausage if you could obtain it. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And he said, yes he will do it, but what size is the pistol? </span><span class="sentence" id="809">We said, well, we can’t ask him to give us the pistol so that you can make the holster we said the normal size, just make one. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">So he said Okay, but don’t blame me if it doesn’t fit. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">But of course that was the whole idea, that it wouldn’t fit because we needed two. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">So no matter what he do it wouldn’t be the right size. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">So he made this one holster, and we told him no, I’m sorry, it is too small. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Will you make a larger one? </span><span class="sentence" id="815">Again, for a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">So he made another one and then we had the two holsters, and as I said, for the two holsters, we sculptured and made dummy out of wood, dummy pistols. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">The pistol’s holsters were open in the back and of course, you could see, you know, whether there were a real pistol or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">But since <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , especially in the winter, was rather damp place - <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was a damp place, so the SS always wrapped the back of the pistol in a dark cloth, black cloth, you know, piece of cloth so that you couldn’t see from the back whether it was a real pistol or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">So we did the same thing and nobody knew whether there was a real pistol or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">Then the SS needed a pass to take prisoners out to work and the passes were issued by the issuing SS officer, and they were of different color for different days and again, one of our fellows who were escaping with us knew a fellow prisoner who worked in the <span class="BUILDING">printing office</span> and the printer gave him some blank forms in different colors. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Now, the day we wanted to escape which was, matter of fact, 1t will be in six days. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">It will be the 50" anniversary, on the 28 of September, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And when we came to issue this blanks - the colors was pale blue - and we looked through our blanks and we didn’t have a pale blue. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">The nearest to it was pale green and we said well we’ll take the pale green. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">We take a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">So I knew who the issuing officer was and I did it in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Of course, we needed a stamp. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">The stamp - again, the sculptor, the carver, he carved it out, the stamp out of a very soft wood and he made a very good facsimile of it, and I tested it on a piece of paper in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on an ink pad and it came a very good facsimile. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">So then I did fill out on the 28"" I did fill out this pass and I signed, forged the name of the issuing officer who was the SS ? </span><span class="sentence" id="830">De Fuhrer, Miller, signed his name, put the stamp, and in order that the stamp wouldn’t be recognized, you know, I smudged it a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And then the prisoners themselves needed a permit from the workshop SS man and this was no problem because one of the escapees was a Clerk in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> there, and he had blanks and he issued the blanks that four prisoners, glassers are going to work in this <span class="NPIP">spot</span> and he signed this SS man, forged his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">So we had these two pieces of passes which we needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">Then we obtained, because if we failed, we obtained some cyanide poison. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">We obtained it from the <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">camp pharmacy</span> , which again, was run by prisoners, and the prisoners who did run it was named Marion Dolinski [ph] and he was a very nice fellow and he gave us cyanide in the form of powder, which we put, wrapped in pieces of paper and each one of us had it with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">So then, now, before that we already had contact with the underground, and we had the contact with the underground through a Polish girl who worked as a SS civilian cleaning woman in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> of the national labor social - NSDRP, I don’t know what the - that’s the acronym of the German Nazi party - and through her we contacted with the underground and the resistance movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And how we did contact her is that again, she was instructed to do some damage, either to the plumbing or to the electricity or something that broke down and that the workers had to come and to correct it. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And of course, whenever we needed something and there was a call, then this fellow who worked in the <span class="BUILDING">workshop office</span> always assigned somebody, either himself to do it with another mechanic to go there or I went there, and he made the contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">We exchanged the information with the girl and she took it to the - so with her we decided that we escape on the 28 of September 1944 and that - how do you say, the word you know, the recognition?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="839">QUESTION:  Password?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="840">ANSWER:  Password will be a Polish carol, which the fellow who is going to meet us was supposed to whistle. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And the carol, Polish carol name was “ ? “ </span><span class="sentence" id="842">which means “They came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bethlehem</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="843">So then everything was ready for us to go, and since we didn’t have the proper color pass we said that we will try to avoid going through the <span class="DLF">gates</span> where the passes would be checked. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And we already surveyed it beforehand, that there to the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> to which we had to go to do to put the panes in you know, the panes, the glasspanes in, was there was a shortcut which led under the <span class="BUILDING">tower</span> of a guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And many workers pass this way many times and they were never stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">So we said that we will try to do the same things, and we had a lookout for us, a fellow prisoner, a very good friend of us who was looking at the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and he was supposed to give us the sign you know whether it’s okay or not okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Anyway, so when the day came and we decided to escape at noontime, it was the time when the SS, most of them went to the <span class="BUILDING">mess hall</span> you know, for lunch and there wouldn’t be too much of them moving around. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">Because we had quite a distance to walk to meet our prisoners, you know, whom we were taking out to work and they were quite a distance away. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">So when the day came at noontime, at one o’clock it so happened that the SS man who was in charge of me and the workshops came to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and he wanted something urgently done and it took sometime and I was delayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Eventually, he did leave and he went to lunch, and then I was able to leave and I went to meet my friend, the other one who was supposed to change into the SS clothes, and we went to the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Because in the meantime, we transferred it to the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> , the uniforms, we went there and these people were quite worried that we were late, and they thought matter of fact that we won’t show up at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">But anyway we did come, and we changed into the uniforms you know and they inspected us. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">They were supposed to then, after we were successful in escaping, they would burn our prison uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">They inspected us and they looked out of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> whether the <span class="DLF">air</span> was clear and they told us yes, and we walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And as I said, we had to walk approximately some, almost half a mile and it was dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">It was really dangerous because we were afraid that we could meet some SS people who would recognize us. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">So it happened that we were lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">We didn’t meet many prisoners who had to salute us the prescribed way and where they had to take off their cap and, you know, look at us, and one of the fellows recognized me because I met him later on, 1945, in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and he said that I looked very pale. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Well, anyway so we came to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were supposed to meet these prisoners whom we were taking out to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">We told them to pick up their tools, the glass, and shouted the way the SS shouted at prisoners to pick up, and they picked up the glass and we walked towards the <span class="BUILDING">tower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And there our lookout gave us the sign that everything is clear, that we can go and we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">We went it was a narrow pass leading under the <span class="BUILDING">tower</span> and the guard on the <span class="BUILDING">tower</span> with the machine gun, seeing our insignia, you know, shouted Hail Hitler to us and we shouted back, Hail Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And we said, what a beautiful day it 1s, in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And he said, yes, it’s a nice day. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And we went, we passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">We had to come to the main <span class="DLF">road</span> and on the main <span class="DLF">road</span> as we were maybe some 50 or 40 yards away, there were always roving patrols would check, you know, the SS and the prisoners who worked <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the big chain of guards and as we were approaching this <span class="DLF">road</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> was an SS man, a Sergeant SS man on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and he was looking in our direction, and he was unable to make up his mind whether to stop and check us out or whether to go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Anyway, he almost stopped on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> and finally, he decided to go and he went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And we didn’t know what we would do, but between ourselves we said if he does check out and he finds out we have the wrong passes, we either have to kill him or take him with us and hoping he wouldn’t make to much noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Anyway, he did go on so we came to the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">As we came to the <span class="DLF">road</span> , going away from us was a whole company of SS going to the <span class="DLF">firing range</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="871">So they must have passed only a few minutes before we got there - so we crossed the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="872">We went into the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="873">There were new <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> being built for the SS and they had to be, you know, the panes had be put into the frames of the window frames. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">It’s not like here where the whole <span class="DLF">window</span> comes with glass and everything’s there, you just put first the frame and then you have to put the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="875">So we went into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> looked around. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Nobody was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">We went to the other side of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and looked around. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">Nobody there, and we walked because they were open <span class="DLF">fields</span> and the <span class="DLF">fields</span> led to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Soya</span> [ph] which floats near and through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz city</span> , the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="879">We came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> the vegetation was quite lush and in the brushes the glassers, you know, took off the heavy panes off their backs ad the other tools and we dumped it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And then we walked on the west side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> going south for some 150 yards and then went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="882">The level of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> was very low at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">We walked in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">river bed</span> for some 150 yards in order to lose the scent for the dogs once the search would start, then cross to the east side of the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> and walked along. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">As we walked further south there was a couple lying, young couple lying in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> and we knew that there was only a fellow was supposed to be - anyway we came there and we don’t hear any whistling of the carol, so we pass and suddenly we hear that somebody is walking or even running behind us and he’s trying whistling but no tune comes out. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">So we turned around and we then spoke in Polish what are you trying to whistle? </span><span class="sentence" id="886">and he said this “ “ and we said well, you’re our contact then. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">He said, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">He said, I couldn’t get a tune out. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">I was so nervous because you looked so impressive as SS men. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">I said, now, you were supposed to be my yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And he said, yes, but I was so lonely I said I better take a companion, the girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">So then they came with us and we walked further south, and they put us in very deep <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> and we - he said we have to wait here. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I’m going to see the commandant of the unit, of the Partisan unit and he will come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And he came after a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">He came and he brought us three grenades and two real pistols this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And then he said we can’t go any further until it become dark because some of the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> and the <span class="DLF">roads</span> are being watched by the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">So we waited in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> until 1t became dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">While we were sitting in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> we heard the siren go off in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="899">We probably at that time were maybe three, three miles, three and a half miles away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and once a siren went off we knew that we were discovered that we were missing and that the search would begin. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And when it became dark he took us and he led us through some pass and <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="901">I don’t know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">Anyway, we came to a <span class="BUILDING">farmer’s house</span> and there we were given very poor civilian clothes, very poor but Polish peasants didn’t have much themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">Anyway, we did shed our SS uniforms which they hid because for further use later on, and the prison garb was taken out and burned right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And we were given a bowl of soup and glass of Polish vodka, a small glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And then the same guide who picked us up came and walked us bypassing the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> further south to the foothills of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Carpathian Mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And we arrived there in the morning and there we were met by two Partisans, also former escapees from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and then taken back further in, deep in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and high in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the Partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">The Partisans were - approximately 100 people were there, and approximately 20 of them were former escapees from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">Well, there were approximately 667 attempts of escape from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and 270 were caught and executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">The execution was always by hanging, public hanging. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">397, you know, survived, but not much is know about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">Our group which escaped, we were six and I believe, I’m not sure but I believe it was the biggest group that ever escaped from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="912">And out of the six, three are - I’m sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">QUESTION:  It’s all right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">ANSWER:  Three are now deceased and of one there is no knowledge what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And the other one, the sculptor who was with me changed in the uniform, lives now in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> but he’s 81 and he recently had a stroke. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And I am 78, and live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ashland</span> , <span class="REGION">Oregon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="917">I’m sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="918">QUESTION:  Don’t be sorry at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">Now, you’re with the Partisans and so what did you do then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="920">ANSWER:  Well, when we came to the Partisans we, of course, didn’t know what the strength was of the Partisans and what the equipment and armament was, but we had plans that we thought maybe we could liberate, you know, some of the prisoners and liberate the whole camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">But we found out that we were too ill equipped and we wouldn’t have any chance, you know, of liberating. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Maybe because it may have been a big catastrophe. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">You couldn’t fight against 3 to 4,000 well-armed guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">It was a impossibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Besides that, even if we did succeed, what would you do with the thousand of prisoners? </span><span class="sentence" id="926">What would happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="927">How would you feed them? </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Where would they go? </span><span class="sentence" id="929">Where would they hide? </span><span class="sentence" id="930">It was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">But we did succeed in one instance where we freed two prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">We intercepted them while they were walking from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">They were taken by genuine guards and we gave them fictitious papers that they were wanted, these two prisoners were wanted in the political department, which was the camp Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And they released them and we signed the papers for them and they released them and they were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">But one of them - no, both - no one of them didn’t survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">He was killed later on and he was killed later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">There was a raid on one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where they were staying. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">Matter of fact, I was in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> the night before, in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with this friend of mine also who did escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">Now 1s still alive but who had the stroke in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="940">We were six together and they told us that too many of us here and why don’t you leave, and since we didn’t know what they wanted to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">So we did leave and the next morning the SS surrounded the whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">Three of them were killed and one, I think I did describe to you when I spoke before. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">He was taken alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And how he survived, he hid in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Actually, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> they kept potatoes, and when the potato 1s, when the old potatos get, they start sprouting and then they remove the sprouts and they put them in one, one corner of the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And the SS knew that there were four, four prisoners - I mean four Partisans - so then knew that they killed three of them and there must be a fourth one. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">So what they did, they were throwing grenades into the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> and this fellow took - once they threw the grenade he through it to the next <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> in the, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> and then they exploded. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And after the second one, grenade, he went into the the sprouts and he hid underneath there, and after while the SS came to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> because there was no movement, and they looked and they didn’t see anybody and they were saying, “He must be here, he must be here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And they looked and then finally one of the SS had an idea to look under this and they discovered him. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And then they bound his hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">Matter of fact, one of the SS man discovered him was from the political department and he knew him personally and he said, his name was Anton Vikrent [ph] and he said, “Ah, das bist du, Anton” [ph]. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">He said, “oh, it’s you, Anton.” </span><span class="sentence" id="953">And they did bound his hands behind his back and, and took him, put him on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was going, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">They put him with his back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">caboose</span> or whatever you call it and the SS were sitting on each side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And at one time he knew that if, if they going to cross the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> which might make a bump, he knew that he was very close to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and it was time to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">Anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">He loosened his hands in the back and, as it when through the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> he jumped out and jumped straight on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="958">He broke his collarbone and his face, you know, was one mess of blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">He picked himself up and he run straight on the <span class="DLF">road</span> before they stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="960">He was quite a long distance away. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">Anyway, he was running, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">He said I didn't look any way, left or right. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">I just run straight, and then he came to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="964">We had some safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> where the people would house us and he went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">And this lady of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , you know, took care of his wound and so on, and afterwards the search came. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Matter of fact, he -- she pretended that she is not well and she went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and he hid behind her in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , was lying behind her. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> winters are quite cold and they have andthe _ are quite thick, so when the SS came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , she pretended that she is very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">And matter of fact -- and the SS were very afraid of catching any disease or anything -- so they just glanced through and walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">So the next day I think I came back from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> back again and we took him to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="970">We had to take him on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="971">That's how he survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And he lives today in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edmonton</span> , Canad

QUESTION:  You were telling me about Thomas Savinsky(ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="996">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="997">QUESTION:  And you said that he actually plotted getting captured and brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="998">Tell me a little more about when that was and what you knew of him while you were there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="999">ANSWER:  Well, of course, I didn't know him before he was captured in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> before, but he was- he let himself be captured. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">There were round ups in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">I don't remember his number but I think it was 8 thousand something or 4 thousand --
QUESTION:  4859.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1002">ANSWER:  Was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">4859. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">I knew something around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">So he came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> voluntarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">We was -- he was a member of the underground in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">He was also a member of the ZWZ organization which later became the Home Army, and it was sponsored by the Polish government in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> in exile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">And he was an army officer, reserve officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">He was a Captain in the Polish Army and he was married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">I think his daughter is still alive, and we wanted to know and to report to the organization underground and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , to our government in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , you know, what was happening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And you know, if anybody wants to tell that they didn't know what was going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , it was not true because there were many couriers who went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">And of course, the Polish government in exile in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> shared the information with the British government and the British government shared the information with the American government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">So they knew what was going on, especially the annihilation of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">Not only the Jews but they were victims as well, the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">Maybe we were not gassed in mass as the Jews, but some of us were and some of us were executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And I don't know whether you know during the last war, lost 6 million people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">Out of the 6 million, 3 million were Jews, you know, Polish Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">But the other 3 million were all Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">Of course, they died 1n all different points of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">Some were soldiers that died in the <span class="DLF">battle field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">Others, you know, died in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , were taken to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Syberi</span> 
ANSWER:  200,000 died in the uprising, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">So all together, 3 million people, and the Germans were very indiscriminate in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">Anybody who opposed the German or who belonged to any organizations which were unfriendly in prewar Poland, too in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they were all captured and executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">Then all the intelligentia(ph) of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , they were destroyed indiscriminately, and the priests and many of them were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">So it was a great suffering for the Polish nation, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1026">QUESTION:  Well, tell me, you knew Thomas -- you knew him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and I want you to tell me a little bit about how you knew him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and also who else there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1027">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">I knew him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because he also worked in the carpentry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">First, he worked as a carpenter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">Again, he was no carpenter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">Matter of fact, he became -- he worked afterwards with the carpenters, you know, and he was no carpenter either, but we protected each other if we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">And he was -- he approached me but everything was very hush hush. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">There were, as I told you, there were informers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and at one time some of the organization, some of the members were taken and they were executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">I don't remember now how many. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">Some were -- they were taken to the bunker and then either starved to death or some of them were shot against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , you know, the <span class="DLF">death wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">If they found out about anybody plotting to escape -- there was an incident from the <span class="BUILDING">central construction office</span> where I worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">There were 12 members of the this commando who have engineers and surveyors who went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">Apparently, somebody betrayed them and they were publicly hanged in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> 12 of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">They built a special <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> , you know, was built on three posts and they had to stand up on, not boxes, but small -- how do you say, not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">You know, without the backing, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span>

ANSWER:  Of course, I don't know about that, whether he was a Georgian or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">He was very dark complexion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">He had a dark complexion and was a very good looking man and he was an informer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">He later on escaped from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">He also escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">He worked matter of fact, he became the Kapo of the central commando and he escaped with -- they went as surveyors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">He went as a surveyors with some other Jewish fellow and they escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">I never heard anything afterwards what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">Nobody knew what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">So -- but he betrayed the 12 and the 12 people died for him because he betrayed them.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1059">ANSWER:  I know that there was an uprising in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz Two</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> and it was -- but it was already after my escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">I went in the camp at that time and I know that they overpowered some of the guards and many of them got out but many of them were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">That I know.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1071">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">But we knew there was a plan to destroy the evidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">The whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was called Fuhrer . </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">He was a very cruel man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">You better watch out, and you didn't take -- if you didn't take your cap off in time, he would kill you right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">And I only know this from hearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">I didn't witness it myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">But he was able -- apparently he was taking the Jewish children by the feet and, you know, hitting with the head against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> or throwing them alive in the <span class="DLF">pits</span> , which where they burned the body and burning them alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">He was a monster of a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">He was a blond and he had a plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">He came with the proposal to the commandant they he knew how to destroy the evidence and what he wanted to do was to bomb, you know, and to get <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> and then machine guns and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , and of course, the German Command couldn't afford it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">It was already 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">They were losing end of '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">They were losing the war and they couldn't possibly commit big forces to destroy the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">So it fell flat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1086">QUESTION:  You knew about that plan in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1087">ANSWER:  Yes, we did know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">We knew that there was -- we knew that the Germans are not going to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">They would try to destroy the evidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">We knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">We didn't know of course, in what form and how it would be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">But we did know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1093">QUESTION:  Did you know why -- ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1094">ANSWER:  Because they did it in the prior, in the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> which were further east. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">They did destroy much of the evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1096">QUESTION:  And you heard about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1097">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1098">QUESTION:  And did you know what was going on in the war on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1099">ANSWER:  Yes, we did know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">I'll tell you how we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">How we did know, we had the electricians and the -- through the electricians they brought -- when a radio went on the blink, and the electricians never released a radio, and they never repaired it until they got another radio and they repaired it right away, and we listened to BBC and we had all the information. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">Matter of fact, in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> I had a big map of Europe and one of the prisoners, who also was a Clerk in one of the -- oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">It was a paner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">Somehow he got a map, somewhere, I don't know, of Europe and he brought it to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and he said, can I display it here? </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">I said, gee, I don't know why not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">What can happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">So he displayed it 1 my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">And in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> I was sitting, on the left hand side there was an SS man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">He was seldom in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Oh, he was not a bad man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">And on the right side sat a civilian German from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , now <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and I was sitting here, my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> here and the map was behind me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And many times the SS man, when he was in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> -- because he was a supply man, he was traveling all over Europe getting supplies for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was constantly being built, you know, enlarged -- so whenever he was in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and he looked at the map and he came to me always and he said -- they called me Leo, and he said, Leo, tell me where is the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">So I told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">I wasn't afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">I told him it's here, here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">We went to the map and I said, here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">Oh, it's impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">Oh, you crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">Our people say that it is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">And I say, well, you believe your people and I believe whatever you want, but I'm telling you that's what they say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">So they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">They knew that we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">We were organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">We were, and if it wasn't for the uncertain of life, 1t would be bearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">But you knew around you everything was all the gassing and the smell of it, and you knew what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">So -- but we -- the SS, later on in 1944, they knew that the war -- but of course, they couldn't say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">They couldn't say, but they knew it was crumbling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">Now, you know, and that the end -- and this particular SS man, his name was . </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">He came from <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> and he spoke some Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">These people spoke both Polish and German, and he was the purchaser. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">He was going around and apparently, what he said, that he took over a Jewish owned enterprise, you know, in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and he got to, you know, for nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">And what he was doing when he got purchases traveling over all Europe, it went first to his enterprise and then from there he sold it to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">So he was making money hand over fist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">He was very shrewd, sly shrewd. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">But he never, never did anything wrong to me or as far as I know to nobody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">There were many, many SS people who were from that part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was in <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> actually, and many of them were from that part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and they were all mostly all bilingual. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">And some of them had Polish names but they were Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">And I think -- especially the civilian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">The civilian from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">He was constricted, you know, he was sent here as a civilian because he couldn't serve in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">He had some -- he was lame in one leg and therefore, couldn't serve in the Armed Forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">But they assigned him here and he was very unhappy and he told me and I did -- he was a decent man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">I wrote through him to my family and he took the letters, and my family sent to his address and he brought the letters to me which were, you know, going without the censor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">And next to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> there was an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">The partitions were all glass partitions and we could see there were four <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> , and right next to mine was an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> where there were ten Jewish girls, and they were all bilingual or even more and all of them spoke excellent German, and they could take shorthand in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">And they were girls from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">One was from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">There were two German girls, one Polish girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">Matter of fact, the one Polish girl, they married -- they all got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">All the ten girls, they were evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">I escaped but they were evacuated later on and they survived, and the Polish girl survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">And later on she came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> is and I met her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and she met a Polish fellow -- also the name is Savinsky -- and they married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">She got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">He was a Polish lawyer and she married this lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">He died since and they had one child, a son. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">And whenever I am in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> now I still see her and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And the other girls, you know, they all survived and I corresponded with one for sometime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">She was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> but after a while I did stop writing to her and they did stop writing to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1160">QUESTION:  Did they live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> too and then come there from the morning to work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1161">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">These girls had a special <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">These <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> were not in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">Our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span> was separately, only men, only men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And these girls and there were other that worked in different <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">They had one <span class="DLF">block</span> , there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">But these girls and there were other who worked in different other <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> , they had one <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">There were blocks built where the SS lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">Some of the SS were quartered and they had one <span class="DLF">block</span> , and they lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">How they -- if they were surrounded by guards, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">I was never there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">And that's where they lived and they came every day in the morning to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">They were very, very smart girls, excellent typists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">And this one girl, because many times I had some typing for them to do, and this one girl she talked, you know, with me and typed a mile a minute and reading that and talking to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">I just couldn't believe how she did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">So they were excellent workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1177">QUESTION:  In that time period in the winter then, in the winter of '44 after you escaped and you were with the Partisans, in that time period in the early spring of '45 did you happen to see any death marches or did -- ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1178">ANSWER:  No, I didn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1179">QUESTION:  And did the Partisans know about them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1180">ANSWER:  No, we didn't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1181">QUESTION:  Didn't know the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were getting evacuated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1182">ANSWER:  Well, we suspected it but we don't know, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1183">QUESTION:  Now, I'm going to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">I just want you to, as if we haven't talked before, I want you to tell me a little bit about being the clerk, because we sort of covered that in the context of other stories and I think that was a really important job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">And I want you to tell me a little bit about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1186">ANSWER:  Well, as I said, the administration of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> is, the administration of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the top administration was SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">The commandant at one was Rudolf Hess, and afterwards they changed and everything was the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">The political department was, you know, chief of the political was and -- but in the political department, you know, the clerical work was done by the prisoners and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself, the <span class="BUILDING">compound</span> itself, all the evidence, all the registration was done, everything was done by prisoners, by prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">The roll call, the preparation of the roll call for the evening and the morning was done by prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">The SS were only, were taking the prepared things, you know, from the clerks of the different <span class="DLF">blocks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">The evidence, they took it and then they went to the Report Fuhrer in the front and they reported everything is okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">And then this Report Fuhrer in turn went to the camp commandant, all everything is accounted for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">If somebody died in the night, they had to come and be laid out, you know, for the roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">Dead or alive you had to be accounted for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">Now, in all the work like, for instance, in the workshops where I was there was only one SS man in charge of the carpentry and one SS man of the whole workshops, all the workshops. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">So all the other clerical work had to be done by the prisoners, and the SS relied upon it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">They relied. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">I mean of course, it was for us, it was easier because we had an easy job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">We were not exposed to the elements. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">We sat at a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">We didn't get any more bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">We didn't get any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">We didn't have any other privileges. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">Once we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , we were just again an ordinary prisoner, except that we were already old prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">We already knew other prisoners and other prisoners knew us and that was the only advantage that we had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1206">QUESTION:  Now, when prisoners got taken out to work the ratio was quite different with the SS, is that right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1207">ANSWER:  The ratio was -- if they went I don't know the name, guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">You see, let me put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">When we went in to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span> to work, I mean, to sleep, then the guards surrounding the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span> were those only on the <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> , right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">And then there was the <span class="BUILDING">guardhouse</span> and all the big chain of commands when we went to work were taken out and taken back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , you know, they were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">When we went out in the morning to work, then they, through the big chain of guards around on which <span class="REGION">territories</span> , some prisoners like myself, because I had to go with orders to different parts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">I could move freely but I couldn't go beyond the big chain of guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">Once you wanted to go beyond this, you had to be accompanied by an SS man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">In other words, you were out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> altogether. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">The ratio was so, one prisoner, one guard; two prisoners, one guard; but three prisoners, two guards and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">And so on it progressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">The more prisoners the more guards and the ratio was mostly one prisoner for two. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">Four prisoners, two guards and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">That's how it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">So -- but with the greater chain you could move freely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">Some prisoners could, some prisoners, but the whole administration relied very much on the prison work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">The Germans couldn't do it without, for instance, the architects and engineers who worked, the doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">There was a chief doctor SS doctor and there were chief engineers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">But most of the work, you know, the donkey work was done by the prisoners, by the engineers, architects, prisoners and they were Jewish, you know, engineers working and Polish and Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">There were no German prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">There were some draftsmen, yes, who were German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">There was one Polish prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">He was an engineer and apparently, he was so good and he was -- yes, I remember his name was . </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">He was an engineer, a civil engineer and he was from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> itself, prewar he live there, and he knew the <span class="REGION">territories</span> and he did all the -- how do you say, the draining and so on of turf because it was very damp. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">Matter of fact, they appreciated him so much they released him from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">They released him and he could work as a civilian engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">He had to report every morning, you know, to work but he could live outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but he was -- he had to be committed to work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and that's the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">And I think another one, a builder and he was also Polish and we was a construction engineer and he built most of the big -- and he was also released, but could work as a civilian and live outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">So that's two instance which I remember which took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">For instance, this fellow , this civil engineer, his brother was also in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp but</span> of course, he was not released and he was a chemical engineer and they wouldn't let him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">Now, there were -- I started talking about there were actually three big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">There was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz One</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz Two</span> , which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz Three</span> which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monowice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1238"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monowice</span> was east of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and it was -- there was two big complexes of <span class="BUILDING">synthetic rubber factories</span> and synthetic gas plants, and I remember when these were built, and I think they were not finished until 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">And the prisoners who worked there, they had to get up around when it was still dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">Then they had to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , if the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were running, they loaded them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">They didn't come back from work until late when it was dark, many times very dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">And then they got the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">Most of the workers were Jewish and many of them died by the thousands because of the hard labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">They were digging for the foundations and the meager rations and the long hours, it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">Nobody wanted to go to this commando, but I think there were thousands of prisoners who had to work and thousands of them were dying and so that, these were the three main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">Then there were set <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp subcamps</span> all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">There were subcamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">Some of them were even in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , in the <span class="DLF">mines</span> , <span class="DLF">coal mines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">Many prisoners worked in the <span class="DLF">coal mines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">There were times when I think close to 200,000 prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">Can you imagine, 200,000? </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">That's a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , 200,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">Those who were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> who got numbers and so on, there were approximately over 400,000 which were numbered and tattooed and, you know, the numbers tattooed, the tattooed number. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">At the beginning when I came we were not tattooed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">The orders came later on in 1942 when everybody had to be tattooed, and then we had to be tattooed and were tattooed and then inspected if w truly did carry out the orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">And the new arrivals after that day were tattooed right away at registration.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1257">QUESTION:  Did you work -- did you ever meet Rudolf Hess?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1258">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">Matter of fact, I did and I tell you how. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">I worked as a clerk in the carpentry and the Oberkapo of the carpentry was a German criminal but a very decent fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">His name was -- I forget his first name -- and I was the clerk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">Matter of fact, he put me in the clerkship there because I was an ordinary carpenter, but he knew of me that I spoke German and he couldn't get along with the clerk that was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">He was also a Polish fellow but he couldn't get along because this fellow the Oberkapo, he was an operator. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">He did things, you know, on the left as we say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">He did things, you know, had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> made for some of the SS for which he got some cigarettes and sometimes even liquor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">And so he did it and, you know, and this fellow in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> there the Pole apparently, they didn't agree and he wouldn't assign the wood to it, and so they through him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">And then he took me and I said, look, I don't know anything about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">I'm not a carpenter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">I don't know how to assign the wood, how much wood is necessary for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">He said, oh, never mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">You learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">And I said, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">So one day he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">He had a plate carved, you know, carved and beautiful work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">There were artists, you know, in the paners and we had artists who came from the Polish School of Academy of Arts, professors, beautiful work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">So this one plate was carved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">And he said, take this to the commandant's wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">You know, he was an operator. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">I said, I don't know whether she ordered it or -- anyway, he said, take it to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">So I said, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">So, to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> you could go through the back through the <span class="DLF">garden</span> because the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the commandant, Rudolf Hess, was right near the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and there was another <span class="BUILDING">guardhouse</span> nearby and you couldn't go on the <span class="DLF">road</span> to get to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but through the <span class="DLF">garden</span> you could get through if -- and so I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">I went through the <span class="DLF">garden</span> and as I walked to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> through the <span class="DLF">garden</span> , was Hess and he saw me and he stopped me, and he said, what are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">And I said, I was sent by the Kapo of the carpentry, you know, to deliver this to Fraulein Hess. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">And he looked at me and he said, oh, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">And I went into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I give it to them, . [</span><span class="sentence" id="1286">told that this is from Kapo of the carpentry so she said oh, wait, wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">I give you some cigarettes and she did go and brought me, but not a full. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">And she said, oh, I don't know where my husband keeps the packages of cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">And they gave me already a started pack of cigarettes and she gave it to me and IJ, of course, took it to the Kapo and gave it to him, and I told him I didn't take the cigarettes out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">I didn't want him to think I was taking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">I didn't smoke anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">So that's the one time where I did meet Rudolf Hess, yes, and I did speak to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1293">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1294">ANSWER:  Of course, as you know he was captured after the war and he was hung, he was tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">He was brought back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and he was tried and convicted to, you know, to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">And then he was hung in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> itself in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> facing the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">He was hung.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1298">QUESTION:  Tell me about after you got out and you're in the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">Tell me about the end of the war coming, getting caught between -- ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1300">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">Well, in the Partisans we also had ten Russians and the Russians were, some of them were flyers who were shot down, and they were wandering and then they came, you know, to -- we took them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">There were also some escapees from the prisoner of war camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">Then there were some who parachuted behind the <span class="DLF">German lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">Matter of fact, there was three of them, and then there was one from the KGB unit, there was one, and so altogether we had ten. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">Now, when the front started moving, it was coming closer to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">We already knew from the <span class="REGION">east parts</span> that some of the units of the Partisans, because we were loyal to the government in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and the Russians already brought their own Communists government into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , we knew that some of these Partisans were captured and then sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syberia</span> , and we tried to avoid that, this same fate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">End of Tape #4 Conclusion of Interview </span>
