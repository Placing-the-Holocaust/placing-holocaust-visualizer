<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Will you please tell me your name and where you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name ts Renee Fritz, and I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Can you tell us your first memories of your childhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  My first memories of my childhood were I remember leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> when I was around 2 years old and I remember my mother carrying me all the way. (</span><span class="sentence" id="4">laugh) Always having to, you know, carry me because I was, you know, a real little one and we had... It was really a lot of walking, no other source of transportation, and that's basically you know what I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Do you recall what happened... Of course, you were very young then... when the war broke out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  [...The only thing that I basically remember as far as that was that my mother carried like a suitcase along with her and as we went along, I remember she periodically had to open that suitcase and give away certain, you know, articles like a little...she had a brown handbag...and when she gave that away it meant having another meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And I remember she took with her jewelry and every time she had a piece of jewelry to give away that...and when I saw her giving it away it mean that, you know, we were going to have a little bit more food to get us through to the next trip and the next meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  You were separated from your mother at a young age. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Can you tell us about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Uh, when we reached <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , uh, I was separated from her and, uh, through the..the underground really did all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">We had moved into a...into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where this woman who belonged to the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> and she got a hold of the priest who then in turn worked with the underground and I was taken to a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> at that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  What happened before you separated from your mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Where did your mother take you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Uh, Before I separated from my mother what we did 1s we went to a...from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> we...most of it was really again through walking or sometimes a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> would pick us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calais</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calais</span> , we were all--I do remember, we were put in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And, uh, somehow we got out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">That..I..we..I don't know how we were able to get out, but we did get out and the march started again until we finally reached..uh..<span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And once we..we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> that is when, uh, people who were just taking us...in other words, the head of some of these groups were able to make various contacts; and that is how we got to this woman, Mrs. Degelas. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And she then, in turn, contacted the...the priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  Tell us about Mrs. Degelas?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Mrs. Degelas was, uh... Well, to me, of course, she looked old. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So, I would say...now that I recall, she was probably a woman in her 40s, who lived with her husband in a very nice...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Uh... She seemed like a very lovely lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">She owned quite a large <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I think the best way describe it would be here it would be like...1t would like a <span class="BUILDING">townhouse</span> , I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And this <span class="BUILDING">townhouse</span> was divided into separate <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and she gave us... Now when I say us, that means there were 30 of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">She let us utilize that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> as long as we had a need for it and, uh, the only problem was that I could not stay with my mother at that point because number 1, I was a child and number 2, my mother also had to take care of my grandparents who were with her and 1n the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">But I think what they were afraid of more than anything was the noise level because I didn't have a full understanding of..that a war was on or what the idea of all this was. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I mean I knew no other life, so this was just part of, you know, everyday living. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And, uh, when they told me that I had to, you know, go away for awhile, well, I just...I just went. (</span><span class="sentence" id="34">laughter) I didn't have any choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  Where did you go from here and what are your recollections?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  From..uh..uh.. there I was put into a...into a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> which was also located in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , and some man came and picked me up that I had never seen before. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">That scared me slightly. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And he told me on the way that the reason for all the things that were going on was because I was Jewish which, of course, didn't mean anything to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I was just too young to understand what Jewish meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">But that I was going to go and live in...in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And when I got there..uh.. I saw nuns which scared me a little bit because in Europe, of course, not like today, the nuns were all in habits and it was a very, very strict order. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And he took me to the Mother Superior and the Mother Superior tried to explain as much as she felt I could understand that I was going to be into <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and that I was going to be living with other children there during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">However, those children leave at the end of the day and I was going to be taken care of by the nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I was also told that I was going to be taught religion and that my name would be changed to Susanne Ledon, and this was name that I would... that I can only answer by. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I have to forget my other name, that there was no more name like that because this was going to be something totally new and I just have to follow these rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So I...I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And she handed me some medals and with a safety pin and she told me every time that I memorized what each metal meant that I would get a new one. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I started memorizing different..uh..prayers for medals and she gave me a rosary and she taught me how to do the rosary and this went on for periods of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Uh, I think the most frightening part of the experience was the evenings because I was taken to what seemed like a <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> that had miles upon miles of just corridors and they were just all partitions in between and I was put into one of these partitions that had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sink</span> , and a huge crucifix and one of the nuns was..was in charge, and I was left in this <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">That was rather scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And, uh, I would just say in my prayers. (</span><span class="sentence" id="53">crying)
QUESTION:  Can you recall for us some of the things you did from day to day in the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  Uh, well during the days...on some days when they felt it was safe, I would go to a <span class="BUILDING">class</span> with the rest of the children but (crying, crying, crying) I'm sorry... Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I don't mean to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  Just relax. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Take a drink.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  I didn't mean to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  It's alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Take as much time as you need.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  Am I holding you up? </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Oh, God.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  We're here for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  I swore I wouldn't do this. (</span><span class="sentence" id="65">Crying)
QUESTION:  You don't know what to expect.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  I know, it's just as... I hope they stopped the cameras from rolling. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">There goes the mascara. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I'm okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I'll be fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  You were tell me about the day-to-day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">The day..day to day was...there were certain days I could go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , uh, for maybe an hour or 2 and that was just to get me to mingle with the other children, but the problem was that they would start questioning me and there was always a nun that had to stay by me because they were always so afraid that I would say the wrong thing because if I did, I mean, everyone in that <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> would have been exposed. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">There might have been other Jewish children in the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , but, of course, I was not aware of it because I was always by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I did know that these children did come..uh.. in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">They did leave at night and I was left. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">The minute that they left the nun would actually take me with her and I would go and, uh, to the <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> and again we would go through the religious..the religious end of it so that I would know catholicism backwards and forwards and this was the main training that I got. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">The actual schooling part of it was not because I could never stay long enough in a <span class="INT_SPACE">classroom</span> to pick anything up, but the religious aspect, because religion was going to save my life basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I mean, this was obviously what they, you know, tried to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And, uh, in case the Germans did come..and a lot of times, Germans did come over. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I remember seeing them come into the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and be talking to the Mother Superior. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So, this 1s really what, you know, day-to-day life was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Uh, once in a while we went out and, you know, walked around some of the <span class="DLF">gardens</span> and so forth, but I would say basically I was, you know, indoors and really kept busy religiously. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">That was the main thing that I really understand catholicism more than anything and, uh, the...of course, the incentive always was the more I knew about it, and I would get another medal. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I mean by the time I left the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , I had a safety pin that was...had so many medals on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">It was wonderful. (</span><span class="sentence" id="86">laughter) I thought that was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So, you know, it was a great incentive to me to keep going and I did that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  You mentioned one nun that was sort of assigned to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  Can you recall something about her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  I just recall what she looked like. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">She was a very tall, very masculine type of a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">She never smiled, and I always...I was scared silly of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">That I will tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I felt I was...Well, now I feel I was probably, you know, quite a burden on her. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">But I was really really afraid of her and I think what scared me the most was at night when she...she would just take me over to this little <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicle</span> and she'd say, "Now get down on your knees and let me hear your prayers.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And then she would just turn around and leave and then all the lights were shut off, and I was left completely in the dark there. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And that...that really scared me. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">That I found very scary.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  How long were you in the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  I believe I was in the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> for almost 2 years because periodically, uh, I...after the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , I went... remember when I had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> which happened one day....came very sudden..uh..that a strange person picked me up and they told me that I would have to leave, that this was not a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">What I found out later on was, of course, the Germans became aware that the nuns were hiding..uh..Jewish children and their safety was becoming a problem, so they felt that they couldn't jeopardize their whole...the whole school system and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And they had..they just had a get me so they contacted the underground which..uh..worked with the priests and they felt that I just have to leave, and I just left there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  Did you see your mother before you left the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I saw her once, uh, for like a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I never stayed overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I was never able to stay with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I just saw her for like a day and then I had to leave right away again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  Where was she?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  My mother was still living in..at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with this Mrs. Degelas and her whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">The only thing that had happened there was that her parents were very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And my grandfather took my grandmother to a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And while my grandmother was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> with the doctor, the Gestapo picked him up on the <span class="DLF">street</span> ; because he was a very, uh...he was a real orthodox Jew and he had a beard and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And they...they just picked him up, and he was never to be seen from or heard from again. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And the doctor somehow got my grandmother.... I don't know how this happened, but somehow got my grandmother..uh..someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And uh...but that was the end of my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">That was it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  Now this person came to get you from the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">What are your recollections after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  Well, after they came and got me from the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> I went to, uh, out in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> and I was taken to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> which was...which was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I just loved the <span class="DLF">farm</span> because I was with a private family who had a daughter who was, I would say, about 3 or 4 years older than I and, uh, they had the grandmother live there and this was really... My fondest recollections, you know, of the war was really the happiest there, was just a big <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and it was just really wonderful except that now I became a Protestant. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">They told me I was no longer a Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So now I was taught how to be a Protestant. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Uh, This...this was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I mean, it didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I mean that...it didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">It was just another learning experience, I guess, you know, learning something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  What did you have to learn in terms of becoming a Protestant and how did that make you feel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  Well, they...they took away some of the metals and...they took away the rosary. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">That's the first thing they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">They took away the rosary beads, and..uh..I was not too happy to let go of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Uh, but they told me I had to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So I just, you know, I just did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">You just don't ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">You do what you're told. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And I wanted to stay there so bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I really wanted to stay that I would have done anything there just because I was really really happy living on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , but unfortunately that was my shortest stay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Can you tell me the name of the family? </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Did you keep your same name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  I kept my Susanne Ledon, which was my name all during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Uh, I do not remember their last names. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Their daughter's name was Jeanine. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">That I do know, and, uh, that was about, you know, all I could really remember from that that except it was a great...it was just happy there, but I didn't stay very long.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  What happened after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  After that, uh, I think the most...I think the most traumatic thing that happened there was that I was woken up in the middle of the night and..uh..it was rather frightening and a strange man came and Jeanine's mother said, "You have to get dressed now because you have to go with this man.” </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And I do remember I was very, very upset about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I didn't want to go, but she gave my suitcase or whatever and she told me that I had to leave and she hoped that she'd see me again someday, but I must be good. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">That I remember her saying to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And, uh, we took around midnight a long train ride, and I remember getting to a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> then. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">It was like a very large <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and there were lots and lots of children, and he took me to an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And, uh, I would say there were about 300 of us in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and I know there were a couple of adults taking care of us, and we ranged from about the age of 4 to about 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">That's where the older took care of the younger, and the only good part of it was that I was able to remain a Protestant there. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I didn't have to learn another religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">They...However, we had... I do remember one thing though that I had outgrown all my shoes and, uh, I remembered that. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">After I...well, this was at the <span class="DLF">farm</span> already, I only wore wooden shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I do remember that distinctly and, uh, that...I don't know why that made an impression on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But..uh. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">that's what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  Can you tell me about your day-to-day life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  Uh, day-to-day life was really...we lived...there were, I would say, maybe about 10 to 15 <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">We crowded into any <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where we found a <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , but most of the living was done underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Because there were loads and loads of <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> , uh, underneath, and..uh.. we were shown how when air raids came, ..uh.. how to survive on our own, what we had to do, what kind of procedures because we really had to know how..how to do this alone because nobody could really do it for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Like I said, there were only 2 adults there with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Food was extremely, extremely scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">If you had a slice of bread a day, that was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">You sort of hoarded it to last, you know, for the whole day. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Uh, you really...it was really a survival of the fittest there. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Whatever you did, that's how you survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I remember getting very ill, and you just...well, you just..you just got better. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I mean that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I remember getting caught <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in an air raid. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I wasn't <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> enough to get...there wasn't... wasn't fast enough to get in the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> , because in order to go into the <span class="BUILDING">underground shelter</span> you had to go out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and go in there, go into the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And most of the time it was always very, very dark because directly across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from us were <span class="BUILDING">German headquarters</span> and we didn't want to arouse too much suspicion. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I mean they knew this was an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , but I am sure that they never thought there would be Jewish children hidden right under their noses. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Uh.. I don't know if all of us were Jewish though or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">There was very little...there was no communication amongst any of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I mean there was no play time. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">There was none of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">It was just you live from hour to hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  What did you know of the people who ran the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I really knew absolutely nothing about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">They were two women, and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And...like I said the olders...the older children would take care of the younger ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">But, uh, we just...you know, we just went along. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I mean, we did...the only thing that we really did do is go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">That we did do. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">But, uh, otherwise there was...there was really, you know, nothing to do.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  How did you feel during that time? </span><span class="sentence" id="217">What were your personal feelings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">ANSWER:  Uh, I don't know how I... You know I can't really say how I felt because, uh, I was basically, you know, a loner. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Uh, that I do remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I stayed by myself considerably. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Uh..I remember from...this is from when I was a Catholic that Saint Susanne Day was going to come up, and I did tell the... one of the ladies that ran the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that that was Saints Day and on Saints Day that everybody usually got a gift. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">That's when you were a Catholic. (</span><span class="sentence" id="223">Laugh) So I remember them saying, "Well. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Fine.” </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And I remember that they got me..uh..like cookies. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">They got me like 5 cookies. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I'll never forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And those...I remember making those cookies last for about a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I would take one bite a day in order for them to last. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And I thought that was the greatest thing that ever happen to me in that <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , and..uh..that I had a Saints Day so that's the only really positive thing that I remember, I think, from the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="232">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">QUESTION:  Can you tell us a little bit about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  Well, the..the <span class="DLF">underground system</span> , it was like, uh...they were like <span class="DLF">dirt walls</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">dirt floors</span> and I know they had beams on the side and..uh.. the two ladies that were in charge there, they had like a lantern and when the air raids would come..they..they would take the lanterns and go down there, and we would just lay down anywhere until the raids were over. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">I mean some of us just stayed there, and some of us went back afterwards, but I do recall one day having...not getting down there fast enough, and I was caught out on the..out between the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the <span class="DLF">underground passage</span> and I remember seeing the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> and the bombing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And I threw myself down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and I looked up and I thought, "This isn't so terrible," and it was like paper streamers coming down. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">It looked like tin foil. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Streams of tin foil coming down. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And I thought, "Gee, this is great.” </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And, you now, it certainly beat being in the darkness and, uh, I don't think that was so terrible and I didn't know what I had to go underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">That I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And I do remember when this landed on the <span class="DLF">field</span> , I was playing with the a...with the tin foil. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">It looked like tin foil now that I think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">They were just streamers. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I don't know what that...you know, what that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And it was just coming down, but..uh.. I do remember seeing the air raids right up above me and watching. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">The only thing that did frighten me was the noises, the bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">That really used to frighten me terribly and, uh..I think that's why I am afraid of thunder up til this day frankly But..uh..that was one of the things I remember the most.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">QUESTION:  Did you have an understanding or what was your understanding of what the war was about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I don't think I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I felt that this 1s the way things were, and this 1s...this is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I mean, I think the only thing that bothered me, now that I think about it, is that I...1 wish I had some of the things that my mother used to give away and if I had what my mother used to give away, maybe I could have some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">That was the only thing that really bothered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Uh, I do remember picking berries though,...uh.. finding <span class="DLF">fields</span> that had berries, and eating berries. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I think just the hunger part of 1t bothered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Sometimes I was very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">That I got over for some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">The hunger I think was the worst part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Really! </span><span class="sentence" id="261">But I felt, you know...I never...this was the way life was. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I mean there was just no other way, so you just...you just go along and..it didn't.. There was really no real association with my mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">QUESTION:  What were the facilities like at the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Did you sleep in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Did you sleep in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  Uh, the facilities in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> were, like I said, they were bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Everywhere from 10 to 15 <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and we would all crowd into these <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Uh, there were some blankets thrown around. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">They were maybe 2 or 3 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Whoever got to them first got to them or we'd sleep on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Uh, it was like you did for yourself wherever you could. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">There was nothing...it's whoever came first. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I mean, that's how it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="274"><span class="INT_SPACE">Bathrooms</span> , I think maybe there were two <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> , not that it really mattered. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I mean it was, you know I mean, sanitary conditions were just terrible, absolutely terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">But, uh, I think...I really feel that most of us stayed by ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">We really did not interact too much with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">We just didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Uh, we all spoke French and...uh... Flemish, uh...but there was not a lot of communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">There really wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">There was really...you knew you had to survive on your own from day to day and you just had that...you just had that instinct..that's...you just have to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">That's it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">QUESTION:  What do you remember about liberation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">ANSWER:  Well, I remember about liberation was where <span class="BUILDING">German headquarters</span> were, we were liberated by, uh, by the Americans and I remember that the American soldiers when they knew there was an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Oh, they came over bearing, you know, food, which was the most wonderful gift of all. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">They would bring chocolates and candy bars and little cookies in packages and that was really, really, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">That was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">I think we always used to look forward to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">The soldiers used to come and visit us. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">You know, every day and we...it did mean getting food, which was, you know, really great. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So that was I think the main recollection that I have of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  And what happened after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">ANSWER:  Well, after that, I, uh, or I should say this... One American soldier, he really got very, very friendly with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And he would bring me things. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">He would come every day to see me and every day he had some..uh...some...either chocolate or just some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And he would spend some time with me, and it eventually got to the point where he wanted to adopt me. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And, of course, I didn't know what it meant except that, you know, it meant having somebody that cared for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  And then what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  Well, then what happened was that..uh..I guess he went ahead with this, with the fact that he wanted to adopt me, but in order to get the proper clearance and everything he had to check out some of my background and he had to give all this to the Red Cross which in turn had to get a hold of the underground and they had to start doing a lot of tracing, uh, back to, uh, exactly where am I coming from, what kind of family. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Is there anyone that has survived? </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So the procedure took really a very, very long time, and then...uh...while this was going on, one of my mother's brothers who had been living 1n the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ..un..since right before he war, he was also in the Army, and..uh..the Red Cross was able to..uh..find him and he made contact with this Jack and..uh..they found out that I had a father living in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and Jack said to me that he couldn't adopt me and that was...that was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">That was very upsetting because my mother at that point had not come back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">So, but I was very upset about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I... remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And, uh, he tried to explain that I had other family, my father was in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and they would find him, and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So that's really what happened and then in the interim, my mother appeared who had once she was...after she was liberated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , she was in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> because she had typhoid. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">She was sick for quite a while, but the minute she was better, she was able to get a hold of the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> , and the underground told her where I was in this <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And, uh, then my mother came and, uh, you know, this was again somebody new in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So..
QUESTION:  Did you mother ever tell you when she was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">ANSWER:  Uh, Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Uh, she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">She..it seemed that after my last visit...the last time I had seen her when I was in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , she...the whole family, uh, was taken to, uh, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and, uh, they were all exterminated except her. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And, uh, they felt she was young enough to work in the <span class="BUILDING">ammunitions factory</span> and, uh, what happened...the other thing that happened with her was, uh, she was..uh..ready to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> which, of course, she didn't know was the gas chamber, and..uh..there was a soldier that was standing in the <span class="DLF">line</span> to get her to go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And he walked over to her and he tapped her on the shoulder, and he said, "I know you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And it turned out this SS man had gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And he said, "I know how old you are.” </span><span class="sentence" id="317">He said, "You can go and work in the <span class="BUILDING">ammunitions factory</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And that's...that is how my mother was saved, because he had recognized her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">QUESTION:  What do you remember about your reunion with your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">ANSWER:  Uh, what do I remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I don't...I had...I had very mixed emotions about it, because I was very, very upset that I wasn't going to go with Jack. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Because, like I said, Jack visited me every day and he was very good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And now another strange person comes into my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Of course, I had been separated from my mother so long that, uh, you know, Mother didn't mean anything to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And, uh, (crying) I think it was just...1t was just a strange woman who came. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I mean, I vaguely remembered her. (</span><span class="sentence" id="327">Crying, crying, crying) Uh, I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">There goes the mascara.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">QUESTION:  You're okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">ANSWER:  I didn't mean to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Uh, well, like I said, 1t was a strange person who appears in my life again and, uh, you know after Jack, I though, which was so wonderful, you know, for the time that it lasted. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And she, of course, wanted me, you know, to leave the orphanage which the, uh, which I told her I could do and, uh, there were these Jewish organizations..uh..overseas also affiliated..uh..with the...with the underground that made certain provisions, gave you, you know, some money and they found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for you to live, and..uh..I did go with her, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And, uh, she, you know, proceeded on, of course, getting me healthy because I was just infested, absolutely infested with lice and I had to have all my head, my whole head shaved off, and I was..I was really quite sick afterwards but I got over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And, uh, with the underground, you know, helping out, uh, because they had doctors look us over and things like that and they provided..uh..a living, a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for us that..uh..we lived in. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And, uh, I, of course, at that point I remembered very, very little German and she spoke no French at all so I had a start learning how to speak German with her because it was very difficult communicating with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And, uh, we...you know, we started...she got a hold of my uncle through the Red Cross and got a hold...who got a hold...and then got a hold of my father and, uh, with that point had to start saving up some money in order for us to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because you had to prove that you...there was somebody here in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> that could take care of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">But not only that you had the Austrian quota that we had to wait for which was not the best quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And, in the interim,..uh..my mother, after she more or less got me back into a healthy state, she tried to send me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but it was extremely, extremely difficult for me because here I was learning German, I was one day I am going to one <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and then the underground would move us again to different <span class="NPIP">quarters</span> and I would go to another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> so it really amounted to, as far as education, to nothing, to be very honest with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I never learned anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And, uh, I...My mother would pick up these books from the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">They were written in French and, uh, I taught myself really how to read and how to write French and Flemish because those were the two languages that were spoken, uh, predominantly in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And..uh..German, of course, I got from my mother and I always knew how to speak Yiddish because of my grandparents so that I found the German rather easy to come by so at least we were able to have some form of a...of communication going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  What was your relationship with your mother like during these years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">ANSWER:  It was very estranged. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Uh, this was just another person coming into my life, and, uh, it (pause)...and I am sure it was very difficult for her because here's this woman who has just gone through all this and now she's got this child to take care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Uh...It was a very estranged..uh..relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Not that she didn't love me, I know she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">But it was just very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I think because, you know there was a lot of lack of communication, and from...first of all, I wasn't used to anybody really ever taking care of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I was moved here and moved there, and I was just... was almost like I was waiting for when am I going to leave here kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">You really do. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">You're always...nothing ever seems permanent so I really was waiting to leave again because I understood from the war what I could understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I mean, war was war and that's what life was. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">War! </span><span class="sentence" id="355">It... When, you know, when they said, Liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">The war is over. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">You can do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">You can do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Well, it didn't...it really didn't mean anything t me. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">It really didn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">QUESTION:  What was your day to day life like at this point? </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Was your mother working?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">My mother...my mother could not work, uh, because she was...her health was not that good. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Uh, day to day life,..Well, I remember I once found a kitten on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I picked it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I do remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And I brought it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and, uh, that didn't last very long, unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I...I do...I remember taking a, uh, having a ...box of some kind and, uh, I remember trying...I wanted the kitten to go to sleep and the kitten wouldn't go to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And I remember I picked it up and I threw it out the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I remember doing that which...I don't why I did that, but I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">It wouldn't do what I told it to, and it was like almost, you know, I had to...you had to do what you were told. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And I don't know why that left an impression on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Uh, I remember helping my mother scrub <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and we had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pot bellied stove</span> that we had to fill everyday with brickets in order to get warmth into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And I remember one winter it getting so so cold and my mother washing the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> with a knit rag. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And I remember one day she put water on this little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> and she started washing the rag out in it and I said to her why was she doing that, and she told me she was going to make me a beautiful sweater. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And I remember taking a rag with her and helping her unwind the yarn and I don't know where, but she got some knitting needles, and she showed me how to start knitting and out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> rag, I got a sweater. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I do remember that.

<p><span class="sentence" id="401">ANSWER:  Well, we...I remember we left...we left <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and we...we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I remember the people from the underground, they gave us some food and they gave us some clothing to take with us and, of course, we had to have a passport and I do remember the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride because we were taking the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goteborg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride was, I remember, rather long and extensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I also remember that at the <span class="DLF">border</span> , when we got to the <span class="DLF">German border</span> , we had to do a pass check. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">The passports are checked and at that point, some...of course, they were German people...they were not the German soldiers anymore, that they boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and my mother got very scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I do remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And at that point she started pointing out all the terrible things about the Germans and she also, uh, showed me some of the...the children that were out on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and they really looked raggedy and sort of worn out. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And I remember having a candy bar, something in my hand, and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , they open half way cause there're the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">European trains</span> where you sit in <span class="INT_SPACE">compartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And then there's like a long <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> and I was holding this candy bar and I was eating it or something and I pointed part of it out the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and I remember my mother slapping me. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">I do remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And she said, "Don't you ever, ever give anything to those Germans.” </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And, oh, I remember that so distinctly. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">She got so upset with me because I had the candy bar and I was willing to give them some. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">But, you know, it wasn't until years later of course...I got upset at that point, but years later I understood and believe me, I understand (laugh). </span><span class="sentence" id="414">But from there, then we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and we boarded..we boarded a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and we were all the way...I guess it's like almost in the hull of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and..uh..we were just all thrown in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I mean there was so many of us and long, long passage.

QUESTION:  What happened when you got to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">ANSWER:  Well, uh, when I got to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , uh, we landed at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and there was a lot of commotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">My mother's brother was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And they...he then took us to...to meet his wife; and I remember we did stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ... Oh, I think it was like about a couple of days. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Uh, we did not reunited with my father immediately because he was in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> ; and for some reason, he just...you know, he just couldn't get to us right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Uh, however, when I did meet with my father, uh, it...1t was not what I would call a very great reunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Not on my part, anyways, because I think I resented him immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Because here was somebody who was going to come and take my mother away. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And I had my mother now for a little bit; and, of course, this was a stranger in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">So it was...I found it very, very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Extremely difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Uh, we moved to <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And now when I think about it, I think that my life was easier in Europe than it ever would have been in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ; because the turmoil here was just incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I can't even describe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">That's how...how traumatic this was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Uh, I found there I had just those finding my little niches. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I was going in Europe; that is...running about, doing my own little thing, and now I come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I cannot speak a word of English. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">My father speaks, uh, some German. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">He's not very fluent in it, but enough to communicate with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">He was a very poor man. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Uh, we moved to a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And by small, I mean a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> ; but there were only like 30 families living there. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">However, they're all very, very affluent. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">We're living on the...shall we say, wrong side of the track, and in an old <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I have to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ; but my father decides that I have to go to a Yeshiva. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And I think at this point, I really was very rebellious against the Yeshiva. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I really feel I was very sick and tired of learning all these religions, because all my mother had done right now was, since the war over, she told me I was Jewish and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">But I didn't really know anything about Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">She tried to explain to me persecution is because we were Jews, which... Well, that was...that's all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I mean, this 1s all I understood anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">So it didn't really make any difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">But my father decided I definitely had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva</span> , and I lasted 6 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Uh, first of all, it meant learning another language, which was Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I could not...I had a terrible time with that...terrible time; and, uh, I couldn't understand the English part of it either. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">So I was ever...I was just nowhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Learning another language, and not understanding the language I am supposed to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And nobody could converse with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I did speak Yiddish, though, to the Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">That was about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">But I didn't last. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I just...I really carried on until they finally...so my father finally took me out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">So that immediately started even more resentment toward him. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And, uh, from there on, they decided I better go to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">However, seeing that I was twelve and a half years old, I had to be Bar’ Mitzvah at the age of 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">So the first thing they did after they took me ' NB: Bat. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yeshiva</span> was I was enrolled at <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> and 3 days a week, I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> , which I did, and I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468"><span class="BUILDING">Public school</span> was a problem because here I am almost 13, and I belong in 8th grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">They don't know what they're gonna do with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">They put me into 8th grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I don't understand one word, at least... mean nobody even speaks Yiddish there. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I don't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">I have had no formal education at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I have never had a day of math in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I mean I have had zero. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Zero! </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Zero! </span><span class="sentence" id="478">So, the only good part about it was that I became a novelty in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , because I could sing the French National Anthem. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I mean, I could do things in French and nobody else did. (</span><span class="sentence" id="480">laugh) So they all started paying a lot of attention to me because of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">But they...that didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">They didn't know how they were going to do this with me through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">So they devised a plan that every day I would spend a half hour in first grade, a half hour in second grade, a half hour in third grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Well, 1t was a little humiliating because here I am with these 7 and 8 years and I am almost 13, but there was no other way to get me caught up. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I did do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Uh, I didn't do it the first year, but they did get me through 8th grade enough so that I could read enough so that I could write. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Math, I knew the multiplication tables and I could do some addition and some subtraction. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Math is still not my subject (laugh), but I got through. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And I also got Bar [NB: Bat] Mitzvah, because I had to; and I did read the HafTorah in Hebrew, because I had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And the other thing is that I wanted to be like the rest of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I was 13 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And it's very, very difficult when you're going into <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> to be different; and I wanted to be like the rest of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And (sigh), it meant...I remember buying sheet music and standing in front of a mirror and practicing how to lose this accent and I practiced so hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">I really worked at 1t. And I made some friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">The friends that I did make though were... I would always seek out the ones that scholastically were way up there, because those were the ones I wanted to be like. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And when I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , they only...there were only two courses given. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">One was a college level course; and the other one was a business course. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">But the kids I wanted to be with were the college level kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">So I made up my mind I'm going. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I'm going to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Which it was quite a struggle. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">The only thing that I did do was, the...the uh teachers were sympathetic to me and they did work with me for many, many hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And like I say, I practiced really, really hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I took some courses that were easy for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Like I took French, which was wonderful; and I became President of the French class which was (laugh)... That the best thing that happened to me all through <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Uh, I did join the choir; and at Christmas time, of course, I could sing all the Christmas carols. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Because 1n Europe the tunes were the same, only the (laugh) language was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">But I could sing it in Latin, and they couldn't sing it in Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">So, you know, I excelled 1n that. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Uh, I had a lot of...the kids that...a lot of them that I was friendly with, uh they were...a lot of them were Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And I would go to confession with them, and I knew what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">So that way, it was great to have had that background in other religions. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I mean, it was really my own religion that I knew the least about. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">But I was getting...you know, I was Bar [NB: Bat] Mitzvah anyway, so it didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And, uh, but the Jewish families, like I said, they lived on the other side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And this I could not...those are the ones I would have liked to have kept up with, but I yust couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And uh...so I felt the only way to do this was then to uh...to go with the kids that were...did excel in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">The ones that were the cheerleaders and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And uh... As a matter of fact, in 8th grade, I remember they even made me Captain of the cheerleaders, which was a great boost to my morale. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">So they did...you know, they did try; but I think one of the most difficult thing is you want to be like your peers. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">It was really so terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And losing that accent, which I wanted to in the worst way! </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Well, I finally did; but with a lot of, a lot of practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And I got to my senior year of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and, of course, I was taking a college bound course. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Which... I mean, they just let me do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">They didn't know how I was going to achieve that. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And I made up my mind I wanted to go on to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And the principal of the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> called me down. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And he said, "You are trying to do the impossible.” </span><span class="sentence" id="531">He says, "You'll never...” He says, "You...you just can't do this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="532">He says, "You can't go to a..to a <span class="BUILDING">4 year school</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And I says, "Well, I'm going to.” </span><span class="sentence" id="534">My SATs were disgusting. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">They were just terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So I told him I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And he went ahead and he wrote letters to the presidents of the different <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> that I wanted to go to; because I had made up my mind that the first <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I wanted to go to was <span class="BUILDING">Boston University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">The second one was <span class="BUILDING">University of Connecticut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And as a fallback, I would go to a two year school. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">But that was a real fallback. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And (cough) I had in the interim become friendly with one gal who belonged to the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> with us.... "Well, if she can go to <span class="BUILDING">Boston University</span> maybe that's where I'll go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I wanted to be so much like the rest of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">But it was one of the most difficult things to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">He wrote; and they told him that they would consider my coming up and taking an interview, because the written part I couldn't do. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I mean, half the things I was reading, I didn't even know what I was reading because the vocabulary. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I...I just didn't have any vocabulary. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And they all granted me interviews. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And (pause) the...[ remember going up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , getting <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">on a bus</span> and going; because my...neither one of my parents ever saw the inside of a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I mean, I just went. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I mean, even when they had meetings and things like that, they couldn't communicate. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Plus they had their own...their own problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And I always sort of took care of myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And I think they always figured as long as I had a <span class="DLF">roof</span> over my head and food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> ... I mean, what else did I need? </span><span class="sentence" id="556">So I...I really I...you know, I made my own way. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I had my interview, and I remember sitting near begging them, please, to let me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Uh, frankly, I think they let me in cause they felt sorry for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I really do. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Because I don't know how they could take a chance on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Uh, they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">They... They said to me, "Fine.” </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And I was called down by the principal; and the Principal told me I was going to find it extremely difficult, extremely difficult, and they were taking me only on probation. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I said, "Okay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="567">That was...that was good enough for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And my parents, at that point, when they heard I was going...you know, I was really determined to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">They...in the 50s, everybody went in to be a school teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">But I didn't want to be a school teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I didn't want that. (</span><span class="sentence" id="572">laugh) So...I wanted to be a art major. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">So I made a deal with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I was going to be an art major for a while, and then I would switch. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Anyways, I went to...went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> ; and I was an art major my first semester. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And if life was ever difficult, it was when I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">It was like Greek. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">It was like learning Greek; 'cause no matter what I picked up, it wasn't where I was going to get that extra help anymore... that I... I mean, you just don't do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">It was so, so difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And my first semester, my grades were not too good. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And seeing that I was there only on probation, I marched myself over to the <span class="BUILDING">Dean's office</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And I said, "I want to switch my major. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Give me another semester.” </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And what I did in the meantime is, this gal from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> , she was in liberal arts. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And she also decided she's switching her major. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And I said, "Joyce, how would you like to be roommates?" </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Because I needed tutoring so bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And she said, "You know, I am switching.” </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I said, "What are you switching to?" </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And she said, "I am going into education.” </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Well, I didn't want an education [major]; but if she was going to education, I'm going to education (laugh) with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">I said, "Let's be roommates, and I am going to go to education.” </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I said, "Let's sign up for all the same courses.” </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Which is what she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And to make a long story short, by my senior year I made Dean's list. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And Joyce could have two degrees; because what Joyce went through with me, I don't wish on anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">She could have had two diplomas. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And if it wasn't for her...

Well, I mean, they were glad that I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I was my own motivation though. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I mean, if I had gotten through, I would gotten through. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">If I hadn't gotten through, they would have been extremely upset; but that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I mean, their lives were so affected from the past that..uh... (pause) I was...I was like the offspring of the two, and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Do you know I am saying? </span><span class="sentence" id="606">They had their own lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And it's, you know, like I've told my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I tell him these little stories that happened to me periodically. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I mean, one day when I was in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> we had a health class; and the health class, it said you should go see a dentist twice a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Well, I had never seen a dentist in my whole life. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">So, as I was walking <span class="BUILDING">home</span> one day, I saw a plaque <span class="NPIP">outside</span> that said, "DENTIST.” </span><span class="sentence" id="612">So I marched myself upstairs and I went to the Dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I mean, I was 16 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">This is the first time I have ever been to a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I told my mother I went to a dentist; and she said, "Well, that's good.” </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I mean, she didn't even know...she said, "Did you have a tooth ache?" </span><span class="sentence" id="618">That's when you went to a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">You know, there these things that you...I think that we take for granted, that just people... People just don't do them. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">They just don't! </span><span class="sentence" id="621">So if you take your own initiative, I think if you're self motivated, you can do just about anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">But that's really what it takes. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I don't...I don't think there's anything else that can keep you going. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Q; How did you finance <span class="BUILDING">college</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">ANSWER:  <span class="BUILDING">Finance college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Well, when my father heard that I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> ... And, uh, he was working in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ; and uh, of course, <span class="BUILDING">college</span> was not terribly expensive then. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I mean, it was $10,000 for 4 years at <span class="BUILDING">Boston University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Now, you can't even have a semester out of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">But I did that; and then I would...as far as my books went, I would... Joyce and I would work our books together. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Uh, but my father did get me through. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And he would...he gave me like uh $5 a week; and uh I don't know I got..I got through. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I got through.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">QUESTION:  And what happened after graduation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">ANSWER:  Well, after graduation... What happened is I graduated on June 14, and on June 21st I got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">So, you..you know, I...I didn't have to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">QUESTION:  Tell me about when you met your husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">ANSWER:  Well, my husband met me...I think I was 16 at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And uh, first of all, he did not know very much about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Because I had no accent whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I never told him where I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">The only thing that struck him funny was that my parents had an accent; but, of course, it didn't mean that much to him because his grandparents had accents. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And, I mean, it..it just didn't mean anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And uh I met him at a USY~ dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">We were introduced; and it was sort of an on and off type of a courtship that lasted for... Oh, I would say for about 5 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I do remember that when I was... I think I was a junior. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">He...I mean he saw, you know, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was really tough on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Real tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And he...he really wanted me to quit. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">He really did! </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And, you know, we could get married and... But I wouldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I just wouldn't! </span><span class="sentence" id="652">There was no way, when I got this far, no matter how hard this was, that I would ever quit. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I was determined I was going to march down the <span class="DLF">aisle</span> and pick up that degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And...
