<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Tell me your full name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name 1s Shony Alex Braun.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> --at the time was governed by <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and later [1940] switched to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> --in 1930, July 14th.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Shony, tell me a little bit about family and your childhood, will you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I was born into an orthodox family. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And we were very family- minded, and, of course, very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My parents, and... uh ...he was a jeweler, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And...uh...we...we were a very close knit family. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And a very interesting thing happened with me, if I may share with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">At age four, I got lost in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">The governess took me out; and she said she sat down and fell asleep, and I walked away. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And I was found by the Gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">There were some Gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">They were roaming the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And maybe they have come from...God knows which part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">However, they found me and they kept me for about three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And this is where I first time heard the violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And seems like that was a destiny, because would it not be for the violin--as you will hear later of our conversation--I would not be able to speak to you today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Will you...(cough)... Tell me about your...your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Um, did you have brothers and sisters? </span><span class="sentence" id="21">What did you do during the day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I was the fourth of six children. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And because of the fact that the violin, I was exposed that early... Of course, these Gypsies returned me to my family after they found out whom I belonged to. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And...uh...we were...I was actually three. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">It's very strange--probably unbelievable--but in three...at three years old I was when I started to learn the Hebrew alphabet. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">When I was five, I could read it very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And the everyday's life was actually studying and...uh...lot of...lot of praying at the time, as usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And, of course, one other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Uh...The <span class="REGION">area</span> where we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">I.G. Duca</span> --I.G. Duca, that was given after a assassinated Romanian president.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And...uh...they were not very friendly to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And at the time it was not that severe as it came later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So, we were restricted. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">However, we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And ...uh...every one of my brothers and sisters--we were two sisters and four brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And...uh...we were allowed to...to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and learn like everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">However, we would be hearing here and there that we are a Jew, or occasionally that we were "Christ-killers.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And that restricted us. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Of course, certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> ' The original name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Széekely-Keresztur</span> (Hung), or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Criturul-Secuiesc</span> (Rom). </span><span class="sentence" id="40">The name was changed sometime in the 1930s, in honor of the slain Romanian leader Ion G. Duca. (</span><span class="sentence" id="41">Information from telephone conversation with Shony Alex Braun, 25 Jul 1991). </span><span class="sentence" id="42">we could not join. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Like we children would have loved to be a part of this club or that club where other children were, but we were not allowed to. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And this... this is how our everyday lifes went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  When did you start to learn the violin?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Uh, about a year later. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">As...as I mentioned, I was four when I got exposed by the Gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And these were very nice people, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Uh, a year later, my parents found a small violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Due to the fact that there wasn't a day going by that I would not be begging my parents, "I want this! </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I want this!" </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I couldn't even say "hegedii"--that's Hungarian name for the violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So finally, they gave in. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And exactly that, to be exact July 14, which was my birthday, they...uh, at age five, they finally presented me with a violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And I was not allowed to hold, actually, to...uh play with that; only and strictly with a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Because my father, I'm sure that he knew, and so did my mother, that if I had just gotten on and I would have played and maybe got frustrated trying alone to get a tune here and there what I heard from the Gypsies, from bird imitations and God knows what else. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So I would have been just dropping it. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">But no, it was with a teacher from the beginning on. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And would you believe that not once I had to be told to practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">In fact, just the opposite happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">My mother, for instance, would tell my father, "Just tell him to go out and play <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and go on the sun. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Look how pale he is! </span><span class="sentence" id="63">He's...he's practicing too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And he's not going with some of the other children out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="65">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And so this is really strange, because most children has to be told...have to be told, "Practice!" </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But not me. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I loved it from the start.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Tell us where that took you, as...as a young child. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">What did you end up doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  When...uh... I really honestly have to tell you this. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">This is only to share with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I'm not trying to impress anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">But...uh...I progressed rapidly. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Was due to the fact probably that I loved it so much; and also, of course, that I was born with a good musical ear. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And...uh...by the time I was 11, I enrolled to a nearby <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> , nearby our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , maybe...uh ...60 kilometers--which was probably less than 30 miles away.” </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And I was one of the very few student that was admitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Now at that time really to be admitted in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and to that specific teacher, you really had to be...uh...very tops. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Because Jews were only admitted a certain percentage; and then you had to be playing or knowing or...or being twice or three times as good as your other friends who were not Jewish, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And...uh...1t happened that I got a scholarship with this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And with age...up to age 13, where I graduated the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And then I got another scholarship at that point... If I may mention--at that point, we were already instead of being <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> ... Of course, in 1940 when I was 10 years old, just to back up a little, then a...a major change occurred when unfortunately Hitler invaded or came into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and...uh...actually came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> , and then forced the Romanian to give a part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">The Hungarians claimed they * This was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tirgu-MureO</span> (also: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Targu-MureO</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="84">The same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> is also known by the Hungarian name of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maros-Vasarhely</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="85">Information from telephone conversation with Shony Alex Braun, 25 Jul 1991). </span><span class="sentence" id="86">were always theirs; and the Romanian, of course, argued that it was not so. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And so now we, instead of being Romanian, we became Hungarian citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">But then the problem was more more severe for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Slowly, we were thrown out of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I was an exceptional...uh...person as far as the Hungarians concerned, with...with their law; because while I was in that--it was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> --I would be playing for the...uh... police, giving a concert as a youngster. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Or for the fireman's ball; they would feature me before anything, with a solo or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So because I did so many charitable things in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ... Like the poor people--at Christmas time, they would be asking an Orthodox Jew... But still, it was no difference, you know, as far as... When you can do something good, then you do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And, uh...so we...I was actually allowed because of that, it really came...uh, to my...to my rescue as far as not being thrown out of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So there were very few percentage of the Jews...uh, Jewish children that they were allowed to...be made exception. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And I was one of them they made an exception to the rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So I was allowed to continue, up 'til one dreadful morning in May 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">That's where the Hungarian gendarme--small town police-- was banging on the <span class="DLF">door</span> in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ...at our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and said, "We give you one hour to gather some belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">For instance, pots and pans and the clothes on your back and some blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">One hour.” </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And they herded us into an <span class="BUILDING">apartment complex</span> in the <span class="DLF">back yard</span> of. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And they was incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">You...you wondering what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And for us children, we couldn't...we couldn't comprehend. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Why...why they doing that? </span><span class="sentence" id="105">In fact, before this came to pass, uh...I like to mention that laws came. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">For instance, Jews were not allowed to go out without yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And that brought even more antisemitism by the...some adults and the mostly, of course, younger children or teenagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">They would be spitting at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">They would be throwing stones at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Sometimes I would be cornered by going from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other in...or I would be on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and beaten up. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And sometimes...uh, they would be torn ...uh, the...the... What do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="112">The coat off my back; and just left there, you know, practically almost with nothing on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">To which...to shame me, because I was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And we would be called "Christ-killers.” </span><span class="sentence" id="115">It was...1t was impossible to comprehend that the same person who "yesterday" was playing with me--gentiles--today he would be beating me up and calling me "Christ-killer.” </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So that day...
QUESTION:  What... Tell me a little more about those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">You were very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Uh, what...what...what else was your family doing during these years of occupation? </span><span class="sentence" id="119">What was life like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  We...we actually...uh...started, as I have mentioned, in 1940 until 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Uh, periodically, it was very, very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">For instance, my father--who was an Orthodox Jew--naturally wouldn't ever be open, or the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , on Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">They forced us to open. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">That was only to...uh...to make you do something which 1s against your conviction, against your religious beliefs. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And they were--the gendarme, the so-called police who I mentioned--would be there, make sure that he opened every Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So that...and he would be sitting there in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And we...we would be...uh...restricted from many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Jews were not allowed, of course, later on, to be on the <span class="DLF">street</span> from a certain time on. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">If you caught on the <span class="DLF">street</span> from...let's say from 6:00 on, you would be imprison and beaten up by the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Not only...of course, it was very dangerous to...to walk on the...on the <span class="DLF">street</span> at that hour; because not only that the police would be getting at you, but the people that they lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I must tell you honestly, not every one of them were anti-Semites. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">For instance, there was a...must, for the sake of truth, must mention it. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Was very strange though. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Was...uh, a friend of my father, a German who was bank director. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And he would be giving my father helpful hints. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Uh, for instance, like he foresee what's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">He foresee it. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Because he had informations, because he was a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">But instead of keeping quiet, he would come to my father and would say, for instance, "Listen, you having minor children. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Why don't you falsify their birth certificate? </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Make them older. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Just in case if something happens, then...uh...they are old enough to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Rather than something will happen to them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And my father knew quite a bit in advance, but he would never tell us or not even to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So we would not make them...not scare them, you know, or us. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">My parents were fantastic, I tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">My father was just a genius in many, many different... Even in medicine, which is actually what he studied to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">But then war, speaking of the other war, came; and he had to do something different. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So he became a jeweler. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">It's a wonderful thing to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So this was...uh, actually the life during the occupation, as far as the Hungarians came. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Now from...at that time, if I may continue, from that time on, when we were herded into that <span class="BUILDING">apartment complex</span> and were about 200 or more Jews gathered from all kind of a directions--not only from thats...uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but from neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We were <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">We had our absolutely no...nothing to lay on. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">For instance, we...we were in the <span class="DLF">back yard</span> and on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> , and it was still wet. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And sometimes it complicated things when...when was raining. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We were absolutely out in the open. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Kept there, and soaking wet, with very little to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">What we brought, gathered in that one hour which I mentioned when the police banged on our <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Everything we were stripped of. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">The only thing, as I mentioned, we were allowed to be taken the clothes which we had on, a blanket and some pots and pans. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Now from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> about three or four days later, when enough Jews were gathered, we were put on horse-drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> and we were taken into a <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And they were thousands of Jews gathered, their families; and the...the condition was incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">For instance, now they...they had...the first time in my life I have seen SS guards and officers in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">In fact, the sad thing about it is that's was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I went and studied in <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> , when it was so wonderful that I would be allowed to be one of those Jews and having a scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Now the very same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , I am imprisoned and encaptured--captured, I mean--in that <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">This also when it rained there was nothing, absolutely nothing, to cover us. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Not...not very long after--we were there about a week, I would say maybe roughly speaking--and some other terrible thing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">My two older brothers were drafted by the Hungarian Army as what they called "forced laborer.” </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And it came the news that they were sent in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">You know, this is what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">The...the SS did the same thing, as well as the Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">They sent the Jewish forced laborer... they, they wore armband and the star, but they went ahead of the...of the soldiers, of the Hungarian or German soldiers, and so that if they were mined ahead of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">So wherever the <span class="REGION">territory</span> was mined, they would be stepping on it, would be blown up-- (cough) excuse me--and not the...not the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And word came. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And you imagine now this. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I was a 13 year old, not quite 14, at that trme. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And somehow I intercepted that letter which came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that my two brothers--the older brothers, Adolph and Emil--were both perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">They were both blown to pieces by one of these <span class="DLF">mines</span> ...one of these <span class="DLF">mines</span> , that were under...you know, undermined. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And I kept that terrible secret 'til liberation because I would never tell my father nor my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Nor would I tell my sister, was still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Uh, my older sister was...uh...with us at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Was only the two...when the family was taken from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , my old...two older brothers were already forced laborer...taken as forced laborer. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And that terrible knowledge that I couldn't share with anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And I begged the person who brought the letter, actually, the notification, not to say a word to anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And I don't know how did he...he got...uh...uh, that knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">It came...uh...through the mail, it came from the Red Cross, or whatever it was the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Because somebody else from his family was blown up; and so were the Braun brothers, my two brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And I would not tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">But to keep that awful things within me, it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So being in that...in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we had very little to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Very, very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And something happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">The SS would be building <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the open, within that the frame of the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> , latrinas. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And would...I as, well...you know, when..when you privacy when you...when you have to...uh, when...when nature calls you. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And...uh, I would have never ever even dreamed to do anything in presence of...of somebody who's not only is a stranger, not even friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">In fact, even our parents, let's say, we would be not exposing ourselves openly. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">That's somehow strange, but that's the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">It...1t took 5, 10...maybe 5 to 10 days being in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">It's very, very unbelievable; but it's true. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I couldn't possibly ...uh, do what...what nature calls. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And that...that caused a terrible problem, because we were in the <span class="DLF">open</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And I noticed when women and men, they...right in the open. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And then the SS would come and take pictures of us; and they would be laughing and...and enjoying that terrible shame that we had, to do our duties in the open and during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">At least, if it was nights or darkness...you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="208">But it...it just terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Now, one day they gathered us again and took us out to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , and they said we have to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I noticed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Now, there were also no facilities where one can go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , if that's the way you want to call it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And what...strange thing happened that we...some of us, refused to board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And the SS said, "We're going to kill you if you're not going to board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So some people threw themselves down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And the SS went and at random took some children and some women, some older people; and they lined up and just shot them at random. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Just shot them dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">That, of course, scared the rest of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">So what we did, in order... For them, life was absolutely nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Like you stepping on an ant, even less. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">But--(coughing) excuse me--they want to...want to show to the rest of us terror. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Always that SS terror, you know; with that fear and terror that we would be mindlessly following what they ordered us to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And we...we boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And I can tell you, the worst thing yet to come, 1n that specific <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> was no sanitation facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Was no <span class="DLF">air</span> , no water; and a very, very rare occasion the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would be stopping and then they would allow some people to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Some. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And mostly... uh, older people, maybe sometimes they allowed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">What happened, if they didn't come back soon enough, they would just shoot them like dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And now, at the next stop when it was, then people were afraid to get off. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">They would say, "Whoever wants to get out, you can get off.” </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Yah, but when you get off, you knew that you gonna be shot if you're not gonna be back. "</span><span class="sentence" id="231">Los! </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Los!" </span><span class="sentence" id="233">You were not fast enough, they just shoot you and left you right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">When we arrived a few days later... Now in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , there were a lot of older people and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">They couldn't stand the heat. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">They couldn't stand the...the terrible scent, or... Or what do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="237">That's the terrible smell. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And we have to do our duties right in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">So, many of them died right in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> as we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">We...we didn't know then, but we were going destination <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">When we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we were not allowed out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> ...off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">They were holding us for quite some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Hours and hours, and during the night and during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">When finally the...the <span class="DLF">car door</span> ...the <span class="DLF">car door</span> opened, we were ordered out. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">As soon as we stepped out, head prisoners--called kapos--SS guards, rushed toward us. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Started kicking, hitting, punching and using the whips anyone they could reach. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">They ordered us to get in <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">While we...we were doing that, because we were not fast enough, the kicking and the punching continued, and the whipping. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">When we lined up, I noticed that an SS officer approached us. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">It was the infamous Dr. Josef Mengele. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And ...uh, that was the man who decide our fate. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Instant death in a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , or lingering life of torture and slavery. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And what was interesting, I noticed--specifically for me was noticeable-- because actually he was holding a slender stick in his hand and which was a conductor's baton. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And we were ordered to file by him; and as we would be passing him or filing by him, he would be motion to the left or to the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">My mother and my younger sister were motioned to the left. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">My older sister... By the way, my younger sister was 9 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">She was made...she had a certificate falsified, trumped up to be 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">But Mengele just looked at her and my mother, and just motioned them on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Now, my older sister--who was 18-- she was motioned to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">My father and my older brother--older than [’--they were also motioned to the <span class="NPIP">side</span> where my sister--whose name was Violet, "Ibolya" in Hungarian-- they were motioned to that <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">When my turn came, to...to my...to my great surprise, Mengele motioned me to stop, gestured me to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And says--sweetly, like a father--says, "How old are...how old are you, little boy?" </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And I said, "I am 16!" </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And he looked at me suspiciously, and then he motioned me to the same <span class="NPIP">side</span> where my father and older brother and older sister was. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Now the reason, and that was where that--remember I mentioned earlier that...that...uh, bank director, the German who coached my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And, in fact, I said, "I am 16, and I can prove it too.” </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And I had it in my...in my jacket there; but...but he just looked at me like with a very strange smile. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Probably what it said, he knew I was...I was no 16, because I didn't look even...even 13, or almost 14, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">You know, but he probably said to himself--this is only my guessing--that, "You regret the fact that you lied to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I let you live, but you regret it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="271">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="272">However, I was safe for the time being.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">QUESTION:  Stop here. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">We need to change tapes, please. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Very quickly. * </span><span class="sentence" id="276">He is referring here to his brother Zoltan, who was actually 11 months his junior, but who appeared older. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">During the war, Zoltan's age was also faked on written records so that he became "older" than Shony.

QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Let's go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Mengele... Just repeat it after me. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Mengele had motioned you to the right, and then what? </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">ANSWER:  When uh Mengele motioned to me to the right, of course, I went immediately into the group where my father and my older brother were. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Because then they would be separating men and women. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And we were taken to a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we were stripped from everything now, even what we had on our back. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Every... everything we had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And we were shaven, and everywhere where you can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And then later on, we were issued these prisoners'...uh...uniform, and assigned to a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">A few days later, while we were... Every single day we would be counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Counted, so God forbid if somebody would not escape, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And, of course, we had very little to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">We had some kind of a very questionable jelly kind of a thick substance 1n a bow]; and each...only one sip we were allowed to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And that bowl would be passed over the <span class="DLF">line</span> of five; and each...each group, you know, in each <span class="DLF">line</span> for five. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And then behind the five. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So you had to pass it over to the other person. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">One swallow of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">If not, you were...you were beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And they would be head prisoners-- called kapos--who would be watching you, as well as the SS guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Now, you know, you couldn't possibly sip yourself full of anything, because one sip; and if you were lucky, then it might got back to you to have another sip. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So we were assigned to a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">One night, as I was standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> to be counted, a kapo came. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">The head prisoners--and let's refer from now on as...as kapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Came to our <span class="DLF">line</span> where I was standing, and picked prisoners at random for what they called it "Sonderkommando"--a special commando. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And that meant now separation; because we somehow managed to stay, my father and my brother and myself, stay in one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">At least we were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And...uh, now that meant separation. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And my job--our job, for the Sonderkommando--was to go around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and pick up dead or nearly dead bodies, put them on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> and cart them or push them up to the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> where another group of people, Sonderkommandos, would take over and they would shove them in...to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Some of these people were far from being dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">They were just helpless, very ill or dehydrated of... or...or from hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">They just didn't have any more... uh, power even to stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So they fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Now, they were left there; and now we were sent to pick them up, as I mentioned, put them on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> and push them in a <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">On one occasion, I went to the kapo and I said, "This man is not dead!" </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I get a...such a terrible slap in a face that I made a somersault. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I was a little boy, anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And he says, "You were not supposed to think or say anything! </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Your job is to pick them up and put them on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> and shove them up to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , just as you were told.’’ </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Now from that time on, there was nothing I could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Just pick them up, as he said, with four or six of us, in fact, many cases...occasions. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Believe it or not, I have a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I couldn't find it, momentarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I...I would have...if I find it, I give it to you; because I know that the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> would love it. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">But it was...1t's not the one that I worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">However, an eyewitness who went... I just venture away from the subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">You may find it interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">An eyewitness went after the war, or he was one of the liberator. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">He found...he took pictures of one of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And he...1t was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And he took it; and when...when I met him not long ago--only four, five years ago, I think it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Either in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annapolis</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Austin</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">One or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Where I performed. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">He presented it to me, when I told him the story that I was... unfortunately, this what I had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">So back to the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I...1 would be working about six days in that Sonderkommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">You cannot imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I tell you, the most awful things. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Some of these people, they were left for days. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Not only the smell, there were flies on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And they...they...the flesh was starting to rotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">It's heat, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And...uh...we're talking about end of May, and...uh...beginning of June [1944]. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And they...they were put some...some other Sonderkommando went and would spray some kind of a material on it, so as to disinfect them. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">But that was (laughing) ...you know, made it look even worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">So as I mentioned, about six or seven days I was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Now in that Sonderkommando was a man who would be about the same years old as my father was--about 41, 42. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And he had a son who was maybe about a year or two older than I. And word came to this Kommando--that...that was the father, who also got torn away from his son. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And word came that the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> which my father and brother were, next day going to be transferred to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And he--the wise and ingenious plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">He says, "In the evening, when we prisoners are rushed, really beaten to group, ‘Get into <span class="DLF">line</span> ! </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Fast! </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Fast! </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Antreten, und so weiter! [</span><span class="sentence" id="355">Ger: "Line up, and so on"]' And so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">When we're running, my son...I going... Somehow, I'm going to let him...my son is going to run in that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And you should run and stay in <span class="DLF">line</span> with...with your father's <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And nobody's the wiser, because we were only numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">We had no names. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">We're numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">He said, "Surely, you wanted to be with your father and brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And I want my son.” </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And I said, "Oh, yes! </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Oh, what a wonderful thing.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">It worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I got to be together again with my family...which was left from my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And he got his son. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Now, at this point, I must say that when...when my mother and...uh, little sister... Back in...in...still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , when they...when the selections were over, and Mengele sent them to the right or to the left; remember they did sent them to the left, my mother and small sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">When the selection was complete...or were complete, they were taken direct to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And they can...I'm sorry that I'm...I'm going back, but I...for the sake of...of the truth... They were given by...by the SS, a towel and a piece of soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And it was in a..in a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> written "Bade"--means "Bath.” </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And they were told that they going to go in to take <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Camouflaged the fact... See, that the SS didn't want uprising, they didn't want wailings and crying, and what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">They were said, "No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Nothing's going to happen to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Just go in and take <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Once they entered into that large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and the <span class="DLF">door</span> was locked, they would let gas in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Now, what the terrible thing was in... One of the...one of the lucky thing, in a way, for me...the terrible thing was they would be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Of course, they would be stark naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">They would be sending us to go and pick up the dead bodies who they just gassed, and...and cart them up to the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">My...as I said, lucky for me, was that I was not the one at the time who belonged to the Sonderkommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Because, I assure you, I would have killed myself right then and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I could not see my mother being...and my sister being in that condition and...and killed, and then I would go on living. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I couldn't survive it. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Now, back when the Sonderkommando--other words, they were reunited. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And my father and my brother, as I mentioned it, and I, were reunited. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">We were reunited and off to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">While we were going, one of the prisoner... I...I told him, I said, "You know it's a terrible what's happened.” </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I was telling, of course, in my very low key while we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I was saying, "It's terrible.” </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I says, "I picked up dead bodies, and they...they...some of them were not dead at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And if they would be attended, they would be healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">They could have been made better, you know, cured them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="395">The illness was only give more food and water. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">At any rate, he says, "Well, how long did you work in that Sonderkommando?" </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I said, "There were seven days that I worked.” </span><span class="sentence" id="398">He says, "That was your last day, my dear.” </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Says, "Next day, you and all the other Sonderkommando...uh...people would be burned, and new ones would be selected.” </span><span class="sentence" id="400">They did not keep them but six or seven days. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">By...by a chance of...of... How else can I say but miracle? </span><span class="sentence" id="402">That if it would not be the fact from that father wanted his son...

"</span><span class="sentence" id="657">Eli, Eli, lama azavtanu?"--"Oh, God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken us?" </span><span class="sentence" id="658">They were beating him until he collapsed, my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And was silent; except for his lips were moving, try to say something. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And I noticed...came closer, and I noticed that he was reciting the declaration of faith of the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Sh'ma. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">The Sh'ma: "Sh'ma Israel, Adonai elohenu, Adonai echad"--"Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One.” </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And he was very silent. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I must tell you that, first time in my life, the faith in God was destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Completely broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Like so many times, I heard after, people say: "How could God allow something like that happen to innocent people?" </span><span class="sentence" id="667">This is the same question I put then. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">How could God allow? </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I had no answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Then, at night, in my <span class="NPIP">dream</span> , my father appear. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And this is what he said. "</span><span class="sentence" id="672">Yitzhak.” </span><span class="sentence" id="673">He called me my Hebrew name. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">He says, "Don't ever lose your faith in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">God 1s real. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">You'll see. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">You'll survive.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Now, he spoke Hungarian in my <span class="NPIP">dream</span> ; but what was so strange, he didn't say plural. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">He said, "you,"-- meaning "you and your brother"--but he said "you" the singular. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And when we...when I woke up... Now, previous day when we seen that, Zoltan-- who was my brother--who was a very strong individual... He was one of those kind of a workout constantly, with muscles some...uh...incredible...uh...size. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And he said...and he said to me, he says, "I am going to kill that SS! </span><span class="sentence" id="682">'Cause I don't want to live any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">I cannot stand it any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I am going to commit suicide; but I am going to take that SS guard who gave the order for our father to be killed by being beaten to death!" </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And I said, "Zoltan, you wouldn't even come one step close, not even five inches close, to him before you would be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Don't do it!" </span><span class="sentence" id="687">No, he...he was determined to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And when the dream I told him, I said, "Father said, 'Don't lose all your faith in God." </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Which, of course, that restored my faith immediately. "</span><span class="sentence" id="690">But he said also we going to survive.” </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Then he completely abandoned the idea of killing; because he would have done that. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I mean, you couldn't be...you wouldn't be able to kill that man, but he would be killed right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And so one day the SS again gathered us together. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Now, we're still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kochendorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="695">They gathered us. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Now, they're going to evacuate us for...another time. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">This time, destination <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="698">When in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ... Again they pulled the very same thing, like going from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kochendorf</span> , back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span><span class="sentence" id="699">° Except this time, was much more severe. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">They stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And got out and started again, seeing the pilots coming so close... We could see actually the pilot. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">They started shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">They took refuge or cover under the...under the uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And these ...these pilots shot back. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">So, again, quite a few of the prisoners were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Now, in my... When we were in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , the bullets were flying left and right. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And somebody... See, we were so sandwiched together that if you sit...1f you sat down, you couldn't get up. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">If you were standing, you could not sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Because if you wanted to sit, the prisoners would be like dogs; fighting among each other, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Completely we were brought down to the level of animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And I happened to be seated at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">The bullets were flying; and one of the prisoners who was very near me was shot and he fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And he fell right on my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And he died on my foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And I couldn't...I tried to push him off. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I couldn't push him off. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">There were no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to ...to make. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And it was the most awful thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">It was another two or three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Can you imagine? </span><span class="sentence" id="721">This man is on my foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">People, believe it! </span><span class="sentence" id="723">That's incredible! </span><span class="sentence" id="724">That's almost as impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Impossible! </span><span class="sentence" id="726">It's somehow possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">It was on my foot then; and I couldn't... couldn't... My...my foot, both of them were numb--went to sleep, as you say. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Numb. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And I tried desperately to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Can you manage how like sandwich...over a sandwich, like sardines. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">You couldn't move...you couldn't move your...your leg one way or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Incredible! </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Incredible! </span><span class="sentence" id="735">So, finally, we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">After a day or so, I knew if something not going to happen soon, I'm not going to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">At this point, I was so weak that I could hardly stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And you have to stand, no matter what happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">When an SS guard came, in his presence you have to...you have to stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">One day, as we were standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> , Zoltan--my brother--just fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I said, "Oh, my God! </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Zoltan, get up!" </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I said, "What's wrong with you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="744">He said, "I don't feel good. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">I don't feel good.” </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And so he was taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">I was told that he's gonna be taken into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Revier</span> [Ger: <span class="BUILDING">Hospital</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">They put him in to--I found out...what I'm gonna tell you right now, I found out only after liberation and only a month or two later, when...when I got to myself, even. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Because I was a long time 1n coma. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">But we found out why. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">But he...he was taken away; and never seen him. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And I was told that when an SS guard walked into that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , they would allow him maybe a few hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And then, since he was strong enough--I mean, looked strong enough--to work, they would give him a few hours to recuperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">See what happens? </span><span class="sentence" id="755">When an SS walked in, everybody had to stand up. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">No matter how...how sick or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Now, when he couldn't stand up, this SS stepped on his neck and choked him to death with his boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Pressing his boots with his neck, and choked him to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">I only found after...after liberation, now as I mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">But as I...as I said, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> now, about a few days later I knew if something desperate...1f something drastic not going to happen, I would not...I'm gonna wind up giving up. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Because [...1 couldn't... couldn't stand on my feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">What happens? </span><span class="sentence" id="763">One day an SS walks in, late night, wakes up the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="765">We were on just a piece of...of wood we were ..uh...uh...sleeping on. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And he says, "Who can play the violin...” He's holding a violin and bow in his hand. "</span><span class="sentence" id="767">Who can play the violin, come in the <span class="INT_SPACE">front room</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="768">This is where the Kapos ° According to Arolsen, this evacuation took place on April 9, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">were, and this is where the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> doctor was. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">A Frenchman, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And he says, "If you played..."--the guard--"that I'm going to like it, we gonna give you plenty of food and water.” </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Because that was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">We didn't have water. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I and two others were volunteering. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">So we walked at the front...<span class="INT_SPACE">front room</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , smaller <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And the violin was handed to the older man, who was in his 40s. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">He tuned the violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">The first few notes were shaky, but then he started to play Bach "Chacon,"--one of the sonata from Bach. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">It's so gorgeous, I never heard anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Never heard it! </span><span class="sentence" id="781">But the SS was pulling his nose, like [it] stinks. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Now one of the kapos...there were two kapos plus the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> doctor were allowed to have that comfortable <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> --if you want to call it, you know, that <span class="INT_SPACE">front room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And one of the Kapo took the violin away from his hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">The other Kapo picked up a thick iron pipe, went behind this violinist; and he hit him so severely from behind that he cracked his skull open. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And the...the blood and brain were splashing all over...all over the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And "God, my God!," </span><span class="sentence" id="787">I said to myself, "They don't want...they don't want no playing! </span><span class="sentence" id="788">This is another kind of a entertainment for the sake of the SS!" </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Which so many times the Kapos did that, and they did themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And I was petrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Now I wanted to sneak back 1n the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="792">And one of the kapo picked me up from the collar and dragged me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And while that was going on, they gave the violin to the second one. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Now, he was about...I would say, about a 25 year-old young man, who was so shaken that he...he put the violin on--and you could see he was trembling--and not...not a note. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">He..he...he didn't play a note. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">It was nothing he could play. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And the SS says to him, "How do you dare come out when you cannot play the violin?!" </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And they started kicking him. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">They kicked...kicked his ribs in, because I...I noticed that he couldn't breath. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">He was like... So he died right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">They...they pulled him off. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Now while that was going on, now the Kapo picked up the violin and puts it in my hand and says, "Spiel!"--"Play!" "</span><span class="sentence" id="803">You came out," he says in German, "to play the violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Play!" </span><span class="sentence" id="805">I was standing--here, something happened that not up today I could explain. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">Not up today. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Now, if all the things that happened up to me...that I escaped two or three executions, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And switching with the son of the Sonderkommando places. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And then I was not burned, but I was able to go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and...and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">That ...if you want to call that...if somebody want to call this coincidence; [but] what happened to me here, this I like to...somebody to explain to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Any other way but a miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">So the violin, as I was mentioning, was given to my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">I'm standing there... Now, when I got out of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , I figured when my turn comes to play, I'm gonna play which I feel comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">I'm gonna play either a Sonatina by Dvolak, which I performed; in fact, later I performed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radio Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="815">But which... Or I'm gonna play...uh...a Kreisler composition. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">But when...when I saw what I saw, and the violin in my hand, my mind went completely blank. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">Nothing came to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And I said to myself, "God, how is this Sonatina starts? </span><span class="sentence" id="819">How 1s... the Kreisler piece starts? </span><span class="sentence" id="820">My God, how...how does anything starts?!" </span><span class="sentence" id="821">I couldn't think of anything! </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And now I noticed, from the corner of my eyes, that the murderer kapo picked up the iron pipe again and was walking toward me. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And I knew I'm gonna be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">I knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">So my right hand and my left hand all of a sudden started moving in perfect harmony. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And the Strauss "Blue Danube" was heard coming out of my violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Now, how I never thought of the "Blue Danube.” </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">I heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">In fact, I...I'm even hate to admit to you, I never even played it really. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I heard it many times from the Gypsies, and [from] my brother--who was a fantastic accordionist in his <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> group. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">But playing, I was not even allowed to play anything else but classical. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And the kapo looked at...eagerly to...to the SS: "When shall I whack him? </span><span class="sentence" id="834">When shall I hit him?" </span><span class="sentence" id="835">Instead, the SS guard was humming the melody, and was beating the rhythm with his fingers--like 1, 2, 3...1, 2,3. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And he...he just smiled and, "Let him live.” </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Now that specific night there was that French doctor, the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">He also went around another <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , attending. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">I don't know why they needed a doctor when we couldn't get nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">However, he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And I reminded him of his son, who was about the same age as I and who was not passed by Mengele; because Mengele thought that he was too young to live--meaning, his son. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">And from that time on, he made sure that I would have more to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">He did not... he got permission from the SS to keep me in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and do the chores; like washing the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> , or even helping, you know, sometimes going and picking up those little cans which were cucumber peels. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">This was our ration, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And some kind of a black looking...uh...dirty water, which they called it "coffee.” </span><span class="sentence" id="846">But nevertheless, that allowed me to stay <span class="NPIP">inside</span> rather than go out in this...in that watery weather. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Which was very... How can I tell you? </span><span class="sentence" id="848">Muddy. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">You know, in that time of the month, specifically. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Which, as I mentioned, was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ; and ...and...uh...1t was April, early part, and this is where the raining kind of a thing comes. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And that allowed me to come to myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">I got an extra cucumber maybe, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And the SS would...would be giving to these people the...even the bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">For instance, the Kapos would help themselves before they would divide it. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">Now, this SS... We have time? </span><span class="sentence" id="856">This SS would then take me to the <span class="BUILDING">SS barracks</span> , and I would be playing. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">From that time on, I could play anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">It was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">But you know what they did? </span><span class="sentence" id="860">When I finished... By the way, that Kapo who was the murderer, he--at this point, when he saw that the SS loved what I was doing, the Strauss waltz... There was a guitar hanging on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , which was his; and he took the guitar off the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and started accompanying me. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Now the SS had...had an idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">He took him and I--this murderer Kapo and myself--go over to the <span class="BUILDING">SS barracks</span> and play for his comrades. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">So we did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">When... when they said, "Hast du genug gespielt?"--Said, "Enough? </span><span class="sentence" id="865">Did you play enough?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="866">Well, if you don't want me to play more, then yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Then he says, "Go stand to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="868">There was a <span class="DLF">brick wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="869">And what they were doing, they were shooting... They were drinking beer, and they were shooting at...at me; a head above me, side of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">You can imagine! </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I was like...

<p><span class="sentence" id="922">ANSWER:  So as I mentioned, that these...they were afraid and they're going to be a riot, and they're going to shoot each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Because they were arguing, these SS, who should do the shooting when I be put against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="924">I was...my turn was to... Before it was only me who was standing there, but this time also, as I mentioned, that Kapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Yah? </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And he was shot to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">So I was escorted by another SS back to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Not long after that happened, one day the SS came and he said, "Jews, Germans,"--because there were German prisoners--"Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">Get out of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And we were told that the...the Allies were very near. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">We could really daily see some of them flying over. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">It was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , now. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">Over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And...uh...we could really see the pilots. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And we were so overwhelmed, I cannot tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And he said they're going to evacuate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ; and they're going to take it probably to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tyrol</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="937">But they wanted us to get out; and we would be marched, and some people would be put on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">cleared forest</span> , <span class="NPIP">cleared place</span> , you know; where we could stay...be there examined by the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">That mean the doctor himself--that French doctor, you know--he would be coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And so we were up...I was put in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and driven into that <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="941">Now, some people started already as we went, says, "They not...they're not going to evacuate us. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">They're taking us out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and they're going to kill us!" </span><span class="sentence" id="943">They started to panic. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And many of us said, "No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">They wouldn't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">They could have done it there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="947">Some people said, "No, they couldn't done it there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="948">Because there was...I don't know, there was a thousand, 80,000, God knows how many thousand of...of prisoners were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And (clearing throat) so there would be a riot. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">If I know that they're going to kill me, I'm going to spring against them. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">What else can I lose? </span><span class="sentence" id="952">I'm dead, but at least person that we hated... We certainly didn't like the SS, and...uh... what they were doing to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">So they said, "Doctor came, and he's going to determine.” </span><span class="sentence" id="954">However, there were machine guns hidden from our view, ready to fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And here again, they ordered prisoners to stay in <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="956">And this time was not like five, and then five behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">But again like the horizontal way, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">So that next and then next...side by side, rather than the way I explained to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And this doctor, he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">He knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And he says, "Shh. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">Alex!" </span><span class="sentence" id="963">He called me Alex.

(</span><span class="sentence" id="965">ph)]. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Please, run!" </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And I understood immediately what he's trying to tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">And I ran right into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="969">I was chanting also the Sh'ma while I was running.

At any rate, he saw me fall; and he ran toward me and picked up...he...he... I was trying to get up; but he gently pushed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And so was an SS guard with drawn out revolver. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">And he was very angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">How did I dare run? </span><span class="sentence" id="983">That means I'm tried to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">That's already punishable by death to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Now, it's his job to kill everybody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">So he came; but the doctor was first. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">As I tried to get up, he gently pushed me and took my pulse. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">And he turned...he was already knee...half, you know, kneeled on the...on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="989">And looked up to the SS who was aiming to my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">He says, "No shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">Drei minute, kaput!"--meaning, "In three minutes, he'll be dead.” </span><span class="sentence" id="992">The SS saying to him... Now he was putting his revolver away; and he says, "Let's this dog suffer the three minutes! </span><span class="sentence" id="993">He's not worth the cost of another bullet.” </span><span class="sentence" id="994">Because the officer, they had to pay...they have to pay for the bullets, the ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">They have to buy, apparently--so this is what my understanding was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">So I wasn't worth it. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">Now he went back, and...and signaled for the rest of it, for the rest of the people to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">When this killing was over, and they were... The French prisoners, presently, they were excepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">Now, later on they would be killed anyway; but presently, they were excepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">They came along, and they were the one who picked up the bodies and throw them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">Now the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> who brought me from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> now it would be taking me back either to be thrown in the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> or burned...cremated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">So the French doctor told them that when they take me back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> take me into the <span class="BUILDING">French barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">There was a <span class="BUILDING">French barrack</span> where only French people were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">He changed the insignia of a Jew to the Frenchman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">Now, I was going to show; but I'm not going to now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">But, however, in my violin case I always carry--I will tell you why I carry--a tweezer and a knife, a pocket knife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">But he fished out the bullet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">The doctor came into the <span class="BUILDING">French barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">He fished out the bullet with a tweezers and pocket knife, without giving me any anesthetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">And next day, the day after, wonderful Americans liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> .’ </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">This is how I am here to tell you about my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">Because if 1t would not be for that... You see, even a day longer... By the way-- which 1s very little known to people--but no matter what would have happened, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> would have been blown up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">Because it was mined.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1016">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1017">QUESTION:  Tell us what happened when you became conscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">When did you become conscious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1019">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">First... After, of course, I got conscious, I found out that the doctors... I was taken by the Americans into a nearby <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gauting</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And the doctors said no way that I can survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">No way! </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">I...I would be dying, and I'll be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">Because first that bullet which was removed without...without anything, you know, was already infection set...set in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">Which already I had blood poisoning from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">Maybe there is another term to that, but this is what... I also had already--which was not known to me--I had tuberculosis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">And I also had...uh... What you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">Stomach...uh... Well, I...[...1t escapes me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">Not diphtheria. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">But there are other words... Plus, was all...all the... had run down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">I was run down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">So there's no way that I...I would survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">In fact, where occasionally I would come to myself... And that's where I'm going to mention Sari; because it happened...it happened that I was put in the very same <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> that she also was brought in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">But she was brought in with tuberculosis, ’ <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was liberated on April 29, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">and...and, of course, run down from uh malnutrition and hard labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">And she also had been beaten...beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">Everything beatings, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">Was beaten several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">But she was telling the story she heard it even before, that there was a young boy--namely me--who 1s dying, and my only wish was for the doctors to bring me a violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">Occasionally, I would come to myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">First, I was absolutely in a coma for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">And when I would come ..occasionally, I'd say, "Where is my violin?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">So one day...so one day, strange as 1t sounds, when I came to my...myself, there I seen a violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">And the doctor says, "Here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">There's a violin!" </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">And I was overwhelmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">Now, supposedly that was a great help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">But I am sure God was the one who really helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">At any rate, I would be sometimes sitting up, you know, with pillows and so on, so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">And I would be playing; and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> would be open. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">And it could be heard outdoors in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">And the patients--they were all Holocaust survivors--that they could walk, they would come and listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">And I would be playing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">And that's what happened, that Sari asked somebody, "Who's playing?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">She...she thought it was beautiful, but I can't imagine. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1056">Who's playing?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="1057">That...that's the boy who's dying, and that was his wish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">Sari would one day--that I did not know, because I was not in myself, you know, with the relapsing back to coma. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">Or comatose, or whichever it is more correct to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">She would come in, and she was only 12 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">And she would come and sit next to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and would be crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">But she knew that I was dying, so at least I had nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And she had a sister and a brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">Thank God, they still have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">They would occasionally come to visit her; but the boy who is dying and playing the violin--to her liking, at least--uh, has nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">And she would be there and asking God to help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">That's...that's really something! </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">But God wanted differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">But as soon as I recup...I was better, I still lived in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">But I would enroll in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">First in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> ; and from there would be uh having a scholarship by the Ford company--or the Rockefeller Foundation, forgive me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">Would uh...I...1 won that scholarship among...I don't know how many, three hundred auditioners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">Uh, so then I would be going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> ; and this is where I'm graduated, and have a masters degree from that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in music.</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Which <span class="BUILDING">school</span> you have your diploma?’ </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">They're gonna...they gonna want to hear you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">Which was right, in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">And sure enough, but I had a chance to finish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">Anyway, and meanwhile I went..one time I went into...when I was better--I'm talking what happened 1n that four or five years which we stood [NB: stayed] in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which I was studying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">So immediately as I got strong enough, still in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , I went to where the women were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">And I was looking to see maybe my sister, my older sister, would be among them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Because I knew then that my mother and my little sister, what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">But I didn't know what happened to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">And I met Shari, but I was just only seeing her for a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">But when...when we sort of grew up, we just talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">And one day that talk became a little more friendlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">And in all honesty --and I'm gonna say that for the world, you know, to the world--that 1t was not the way as people accustomed today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">I have no judgement, whichever...whoever does what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">This 1s their business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">But however, that--call it "old fashion"--way was not that you "went together" maybe--I don't know how strongly I can say--before you get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">You know what I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And so, at any rate, she was...before she became...just before she became 17, we got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">And soon after, we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">But at that time, I was studying and so was she. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">And...uh...I had a chance to finish uh the <span class="BUILDING">Academy of Music</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> ; which I am very, very lucky to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">And then coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> started some other problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">And it was very, very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">At first, you could not get a... I could not land a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">In fact, I was offered a job in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ; because I have the credentials to teach. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">However, by the time I got here to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , it took so long... I was not well yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And uh was difficulty because even though that I recovered from tuberculosis, but <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> at that time they were very reluctant to let, even though that I was "cured.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">Which I am, thank God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">But still I had to go through tests, and another test, and wait, and ___; and this kind of a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">So that job was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And I did certain things that...when I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">I became a filing clerk 1n an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">Then, still in part-time, I became the uh manager of the...uh... Oh, it's sort of a... How do you call that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">Uh, a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , which they manufactured dresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">I had absolutely no idea about that; but I was working in the very same...same uh <span class="BUILDING">office</span> for the same people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">And I was doing so well that when... Well, from one day to the other the owner of that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , [his] brother-in-law left him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">They thought that I would be doing well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">And, my God, would you believe I did? </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">Just on part-time! (</span><span class="sentence" id="1149">Laughing) So finally after I got a job in the <span class="BUILDING">Cleveland symphony</span> --or a position, I should say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">Uh, then I had difficulty leaving that man; because...uh... I will tell you honestly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">It was [Lempol (ph)]| Fashions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">It was a wonderful uh dress manufacture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">They're not in existence, so I can mention that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">I don't mean to...I don't mean to give any plug, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">But it isn't that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">They were nice people; and...uh...so he...he was offering me any kind of a thing...so even in part- time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">Because my only day... Of course, we married; and a boy came to us, first child, and the second one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">We have two children, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">And...uh, may I mention, Robert. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">Now he's a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">We're very proud of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">And so are we very proud of our daughter, Dinah, who also... She finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">She has a degree in psychology. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">However, she's a business lady now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1165">QUESTION:  You have been playing the violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">Just tell us a little bit about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1167">ANSWER:  In Europe um I was... After, of course, liberation and I was still in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">But I was having offers; and I played with various symphony orchestras. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">And also <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radio Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">And in various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , almost in every one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">Then I gave command performances, and I'm gonna mention a few.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1172">QUESTION:  Not..not...not the whole thing, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1173">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1174">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">Because it's not that kind of a professional listing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">Just tell us, when you came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ...
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1177">QUESTION:  ...did you...? </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">Uh, you got a position with the Cleveland Symphony. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">How long were with you them, and where did you go from there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1180">ANSWER:  I was only with three years with the Symphony. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">And uh a very strange thing--not even that long, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">Three...after three seasons, a very strange thing uh made me quit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">One 1s that...you remember I mentioned earlier that I was lost in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , and I was exposed to the violin by the Gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And I really loved Gypsy music from that time on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">Always! </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">And secretly, I would be going back to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and listening to the Gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">I would sometimes disappear from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ; but at the time I was already older, you know, than four years old, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">But 11 or 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">And I would be asking these Gypsies to teach me some of the songs that they played that was so fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">And they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">So I learned a lot of different kind of music. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">Even if I was not allowed to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">But as I said, secretly I would be doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">And...uh...so...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> , as I said, certain strange circumstance got me... uh, made me to leave the symphony orchestra. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">First, it was really very badly paid at those time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">And secondly, the conductor, uh Maestro [George] Szell, was very rough, so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">I shouldn't say that uh openly, because there are millions of people may know him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">However, he was probably one of the greatest in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">And...uh...I also had a job--an offer, that is--uh, to play this kind of music and teach. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">Teach, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">So I left, and I got lots of pupils. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">But that was very straining on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">So finally, I got a job in a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> ; which was, of course, much more profitable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">And I met a lot of people and I learned lot about the way of people living in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">Which I really loved to be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">And uh this also made me grew up in a different way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">Because I was very, very sensitive when I came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">And probably I would be still sitting in an orchestra. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">However, I'm not sorry at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">Because mentioning once, since you are from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , uh if I would be in that orchestra--like Cleveland Symphony--being just a violinist in the orchestra... Even the first violin section, but still I would never be invited to the <span class="BUILDING">White House</span> --as I was a few years ago, during the Reagan era, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">And that was a big thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">Or...or go to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and give a concert; or to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> and give a concert. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">It...1t's...these kind of a thing would have not occurred, because I would be still maybe a screw in a big machine, a little teeny screw. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Uh, so I'm not sorry at all that I left that part.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1215">QUESTION:  And you have made a new life here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1216">ANSWER:  Oh, Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">Well, as I said, now I am... For instance, which I'm very proud to mention, I wrote several--I'm a composer also--several pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">And one of them which is my...probably the greatest thing that I ever written in my life entitled the "Symphony of the Holocaust.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">Which I was fortunate to perform it with two major symphony orchestras, large symphony orchestras. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">And uh so I just keep on writing and playing as long as God wants me to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1221">QUESTION:  Good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">And on that note, I think now we will end this section. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1224">ANSWER:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">TAPE #5: PERFORMANCE The violin he plays is a Galliano (circa 1740), from the workshop of Amati (teacher of Stradivarius).
