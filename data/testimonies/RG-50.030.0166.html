in 5, a hundred in a group, and the SS with the dogs took us to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We had to walk, let's say, maybe 10 miles a day to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Many of them died on the way walking so they give us a stick to put us there dead people. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Two have to hold them this way. </span><span class="sentence"

</span><span class="sentence" id="189">Beat us up. ” </span><span class="sentence" id="190">You know just for fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Pulled out a few people, beat us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Then they gave us a piece of bread, but we didn't know, should we take a crumb every hour or should we swallow it right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">We couldn't figure out what to do with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">When we ate it up, we was sorry why we ate it up already. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">This way we have another crumb to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">We was going to work...was beaten up, after work all the time, kicked us up, beat us up. ” </span><span class="sentence"

class="sentence" id="200">You know, it wasn't actually work, but on top of it just to make people work. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Just to make people work. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Then on Sunday, when we came back from work Sunday, the day off, we had to put our clothes, button up in the back and put in a lot of sand so one <span class="NPIP">place</span> we ’’slept to another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So people who couldn't run fast, the dogs went after them. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Always beaten up, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">It was a helluva condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I can't believe...I was 18 years old that that. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I... can't visualize how people can even go through that without food, without water, with everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">That was going on for 2 and a half years in...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Then when they saw the Russian...the Russian are coming, they took us from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">There was already better <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and a better thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , I forgot to mention, that...there was an uprising in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">They killed a lot of Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">They put them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> , but in 5 minutes the whole <span class="DLF">sky</span> was with so many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German airplanes</span> that you couldn't see the <span class="DLF">skies</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And everybody who was moving was killed anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">People start to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">They wants to find out how those people was organized because nobody can have a pencil or a piece of paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">One of mine counselor, like a blockaltester, was 5 girls, 5 sisters from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">She kind of tried to put on paper what's happened and she hid it in her coat and they find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">So they said they're going to shot her. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So the other four sisters stood by and they said, "We want to be shot too." </span><span class="sentence" id="221">So they shot all five sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Then when they start to figure out how the uprising...there was a girl...I think was her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I forgot.” </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I think. ” </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And she was organized this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">So they wants to take her to hang her, so she cut her veins. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And she slapped the SS man. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">He says, "You're dying." </span><span class="sentence" id="229">She says, "I die today, but you gonna die tomorrow." </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Even make a film from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Then one girl dropped...girls who brought in the evening ammunition what they smuggled out” ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">One girl broke down. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">They beat her up and she says, "If you tell us, what's happening, you're gonna be ’’sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">We're not going to torture you." </span><span class="sentence" id="235">But that wasn't the...the fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">She knew three other girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">That's all she knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And one of the girls was ” my girlfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">They beat her up. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">She didn't tell anything because they would hang a lot of people if she would tell to who she gave and how the things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">The girl who gave up was the first to be hanged. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">The German punished her. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And everybody have to stay and watch when they hang those four girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">It was like in...in January. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">In January 18, we have to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">They announced the microphone, we...I and five girls wants to hide it between the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So they announced on the microphone if they catch anybody, they will be shot on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">So I says to the girls, "Maybe it's no use to do it. </span><span

But I even now we was tired walking, so the same day came in the...the American soldiers and the Russians the same day, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mettlenberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And they was kissing each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Thank God that the war is over, because 1n some <span class="NPIP">places</span> the Germans was still

we took the horses and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and we start to go out closer to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Then when the night came over, we took out a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and we went the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to stay overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Part of the way was a lot of soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">You know, they let out from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , from the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> everything, and there was a rape

a lot of people came out from the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">They do bad things. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">We can't control it.

id="323">They was afraid for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">So he says, "I can't protect you anymore," he says. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">You take...try to take the <span

id="326">So we went on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> happened like there was going for an hour and 6 hours there was standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">It was broken off. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">We went in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span

<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">So we decided every girl would go, lay down under a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">In the morning, we will board it. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">We were laying like that a whole under those broken <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">You know, every girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">In...In the morning, we got up. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> left already with our stuff and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">We didn't care already. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">So we starts to go from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to the other til we got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Well, being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , we didn't have any families. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">We didn't have anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">They wasn't well organized like after the war, so we decided we're going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Because we got some property there, we're going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">So 10 girls came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">We didn't realize that

</span><span class="sentence" id="351">So they didn't want us. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">So when you went out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , you saw laying dead Jews, which they came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or from the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">They weren't missed by nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">They didn't have any family, so nobody knew who they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Their families was killed, and they sneaked out from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> in 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">So all the time you saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So finally, what we gonna do? </span><span class="sentence" id="358">I came back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">With five other girls, went in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">The ”’ Army

wasn't missed by nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">So we decided it's not good we...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> either. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">A few...a few remained. </span><span class="sentence"
