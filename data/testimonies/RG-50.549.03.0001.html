<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  And this is your place of work, and what do you do here, what is your work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Well, my work on the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> -- I’d have to actually go back and explain a little something about the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2">The <span class="BUILDING">court</span> was established already by the League of Nations in- in early 1920’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">It’s a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> where you deal only with disputes between states. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And we also render advisory opinions for the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> , but basically disputes between states. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">We -- we have quite a number of cases pending now, and we hear cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Since getting to the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> in March, I’ve already sat on -- on five very important cases, including a case involving <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  That was a very good lead-in to a follow-up question I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Could you give us one or two examples of the kinds of cases that you’re working on right now? </span><span class="sentence" id="9">February 27, 2001
ANSWER:  Ri -- at this very moment, actually, we -- we are in the process of finishing a dispute between <span class="COUNTRY">Qatar</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Bahrain</span> , those are disputes relating to territorial and maritime -- the limitation questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">That is to say, the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> want the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> to determine certain disputed issues relating to their <span class="REGION">territory</span> and also to their -- their <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">At the same time we are dealing with a case between <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in which <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> brought an action against the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because of the execution of two young Germans who were not given -- or allegedly not given an opportunity to consult the German consular authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">So the allegation is a breach of the -- of the Vienna convention on that subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">We’ve also recently dealt with a case that 1s still -- well, we'll be hearing oral arguments involving an international arrest warrant issued by <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> against the foreign minister -- former foreign minister of the <span class="COUNTRY">Congo</span> , charging him with crimes against humanity and war crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And the issue is whether <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> had the right to -- to issue these -- these arrest warrants. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So those are the type of cases we deal with, we- the first case on which I sat here related to an aerial dispute between <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Pakistan</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  And you took me on a lovely tour for the <span class="BUILDING">Peace Palace</span> here, you mentioned as an aside that when you sp -- began working here. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Or years ago, I forgot now, there were very few cases, you worked on just one or two, and now you have very m -- a lot of work to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Why is that? </span><span class="sentence" id="19">February 27, 2001
ANSWER:  Well, I of course am -- am new at the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , but in the days of the Cold War, basically since the second World War, initially there were very, very few cases coming, and that was because of the Cold War. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And I think governments had the sense that this would be an ideologically divided <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , and that justice would not really be done properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Once the Cold War ended, cases started to come, and also I should tell you from what I’ve heard that the atmosphere on the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> is very different than it was at the height of the Cold War. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I-It’s a much easier, much more judicial type of -- of environment than it must have been, I -- I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  When were you appointed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  I was elected by the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> on March second of 2000. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And it’s interesting, the- it’s an election both by the security council and the general assembly. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">By both bodies, voting separately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  And now you live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , or in [indecipherable] for good?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Well, until my -- my term is up and -- but it seemed to u -- to my wife and me important that we be here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> while the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> -- and -- and there 1s so much business now that one really couldn’t afford to be living in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and be sitting on this <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">It’s basic -- it is a permanent <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> 1s -- it’s new for us, but very exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">February 27, 2001
QUESTION:  What -- do you consider this -- this new work, or this job as sort of a crowning continuation of your very distinguished career in international law, and international human rights, or is it also -- or is it a difference -- somewhat different direction?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  In many ways it’s -- it’s a different direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I’ve -- as you know, I -- I was a judge on the inter-American court of human rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I’ve also sat on the UN Human Rights Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And thi -- this is very much an strictly <span class="BUILDING">international court</span> , but human rights issues can arise, but a lot of other cases come as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So, f-for an international lawyer like me, this is a dream court, and a dream come true.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  Is it in some sense a relief not to be related so closely to very painful experiences, to -- or 1s it -- what do you mean when you say a dream?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  It’s a dream in the sense that I think there isn’t an international lawyer who wouldn’t want to be on this <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , because it is really -- 1-it’s like being on the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">This is the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> that determines what is and what is not international law. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Not that we are that 1m-important, but in -- in terms of those of us who believe in international law, and -- and practice international law, this is the -- the Mecca to which you look.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  Have you ever imagined that you would be in this position?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  N-Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Well I -- as a matter of fact I was -- I-I visited -- I had a meeting at the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , not with the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> but in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , in November bef -- of 1999, and I had -- I didn’t at that point believe that I was going to be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I -- I think it would be totally February 27, 2001 arrogant for anybody to believe that you’re going to be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">You dream about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">At my age you stop dreaming about it even, and then suddenly I -- I was named. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Actually, I should tell you that the notice to me that I was going to be the nominee of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> for the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> came to me while I was -- had just done a visit to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , my second visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , had just come back from it, in the evening, in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> when I received the call from the legal advisory. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">That was very special.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  Is it strange, or is it strangely appropriate that you are now living and working in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">My wife and I have always said that we -- that we could live almost ev - anyplace, but I -- I think as we get older we probably should be a little more restrictive. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">But -- but it’s certainly a -- a -- one -- one couldn’t ask for a more enjoyable environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">We miss our children, we miss our grandchildren, we have eight grandchildren and they keep coming, so that part. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">But life here, and the working environment 1s certainly wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I miss my students, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I don’t miss exams, I don’t miss that part, but I miss not having classes and seminars. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Because this existence here, to some extent is quite lonely. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Like many other judicial -- many other <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> have this -- judges have that same experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">You work basically by yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  I guess my question was also aimed a little bit at knowing your background, that you originally came from Europe and now that you live in Europe again, did you ever have the desire never to live in Europe again or 1s it -- February 27, 2001
ANSWER:  No, we -- w-we -- I’ve come back many a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I didn’t think that I was going to live here. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I -- I once had a possibility, it looked like a possibility to -- to serve on the European court of human rights, and we debated the issue of whether we would live in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But it never seemed like a difficult choice if one had -- if the -- 1f what one was asked to do was interesting enough, the -- the living environment didn’t play that much of a role. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But I must say, one couldn’t really ask for a nicer <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be than here in the -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  Now I would like to go back into the past, and I would like to ask you about the -- the time when you came over to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> trip, what you remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">You were 17 at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  Yes, it was in -- in December of 1951, that’s exactly 50 years ago this year. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We were on one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop carriers</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">liberty boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">It was the SS General Greeley, | still remember the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And I think it was a -- a 10 day trip from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremerhaven</span> to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , with a lot of refugees, people from all over, from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , [indecipherable] even -- I have some pictures still. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And it was a very scary experience except that I knew I was coming to -- to live with my uncle, and in that sense it -- it -- and I was young, so it wasn’t as scary as what it must have been for -- for a lot of other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">But also the life on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was very interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I -- I managed to get myself a interpreter’s job so I didn’t have to paint and scrub the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And it was a lot of fun, and va -- I was writing for the -- for the news -- ship newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So from that point February 27, 2001 of view it was all exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I really had no idea what awaited me in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , whether I would stay in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">It was adventure at the age of 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  Why were you supposed to -- I -- were ev -- was everybody supposed to -- to work there? </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Was it because you didn’t have money for the fare, or wa -- just --
ANSWER:  It was strange, we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and people were told they had to scrub the <span class="INT_SPACE">decks</span> , paint the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and do all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">But they needed people who could annou -- make announcements in different languages and so I volunteered for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">That’s --
QUESTION:  Looks like you’re a survivor of [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  It -- it was -- it -- well, at least it kept me above <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> , which -- which was nicer then, because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was very crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">One thing that we were all served American food, of course, for breakfast and they had these lovely boxes of cereal, these single cereal things. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">None of us knew what to do with that, and so after we ate breakfast, we hi -- we carry -- walked around with these boxes and thought that that was dessert. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">That’s what I remember from my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">But arriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , you know, the -- and we- we S -- we Sat -- we actually arrived in the evening, so we -- we weren’t unloaded, couldn’t disembark until the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And to see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> with the -- all the lights and everything, was quite -- 1-1n some ways exciting, in some ways it brought back memories of the past, and I -- I’ve often thought about that -- that moment, and it’s -- it’s further and further away now, I had to reread what I had written at -- at that moment about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">But I think -- when I saw the lights, I thought of the <span class="BUILDING">crematories</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">February 27, 2001
QUESTION:  You -- you did write an article for -- for a -- could you s-say that you wrote an article about a newspaper, or something? </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Or several people actually put together a newspaper, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Yes, wh-what we did on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , we put together a newspaper in all the languages that were represented on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and I think there must have been 37 different languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Some had to be handwritten because there were no -- no typewriters 1n those languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I -- I wrote it in German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  Who -- who got the -- who got those newspapers, actually, in the end?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  Everybody on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I still have mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I -- I found a copy the other day. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">That’s the advantage of moving around, because you find things you think you’ve lost many, many years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  So then you arrived, and you were picked up by family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  No, I -- I wa -- I -- I -- I was picked up by a Jewish social service organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">The -- there must have been some sort of quarantine system, because I came over on the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> -- rather, children’s displaced person quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And wi -- I -- I spend a few days in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I don’t know wh -- what the purpose was, and it was there that my uncle then came and -- and picked me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">But there were quite a number of kids who had ri -- arrived a little earlier, who were Americans already because they’d come there a few weeks before I did, and showed me <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But then my uncle came and -- and February 27, 2001 picked me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And then I -- I lived for a year and a half in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> with my uncle, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Patterson</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  Quick question, what did they show you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Did anything happen -- I mean, did you understand what you were supposed to do in this weird <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Well the -- I -- I -- for one thing, we -- we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> and they got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And I didn’t know where I was and where I was going and what the address was. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But the impressive thing to me were, of course, at that time, coming from Europe, to see these big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and these big <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">It di -- wonders to -- it was a marvel, you just couldn't get over it, that sort of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And also the thing that, to me, somebody who’s gone through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was the most striking, if you ordered a salami sandwich, you got about an inch of salami, whereas I remember at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , 1-1f you were lucky you got a very thin slice of whatever meat there was on the -- on the sandwich. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Or liverwurst sandwiches. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And ice cream. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Those were things that I just hadn’t seen and couldn’t believe that that existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So that was the most impressive part.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  Was eating important to you then, for -- for awhile at least?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Not so much eating as knowing that -- that there were all these things that were available. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> , at that point, there were just about every second <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> had a kosher sign outside the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">If you asked somebody f-for instructions in English, they answered you in Yiddish, or in some other language. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">It was a very different February 27, 2001 life from -- I -- I came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greding</span> in -- which is my mother’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">All of this was just like having come into totally different <span class="NPIP">worlds</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  You did not speak Yiddish, you spoke -- do you speak German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  I spoke ger -- yes, I understand Yiddish, I can speak it if I have to, but it’s -- it’s really a distorted German, more than -- than proper Yiddish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  Did you get along with your uncle? </span><span class="sentence" id="128">How was it living ow -- living there, and what happened with regard to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  Oh no, I got along wonderful there, they are wonderful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">My -- my uncle is my - the brother of my mother, and they had -- th-they were not well off, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">My -- my uncle, and my aunt worked in a -- in a <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span> at the time, and my uncle in a <span class="BUILDING">aircraft factory</span> and they had a little daughter there tha -- when I came that -- we didn’t have an extra <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But they -- they shared everything with me, and -- and took me in, and -- and really were my parents for -- for that period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I arrived, as I mentioned, in December. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> already in January, in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Patterson</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And I was given one of these strange tests, because the -- the teachers didn’t know, you know, where I came from -- I'd had very little schooling before, anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I -- I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but -- for two and a half years, and I had a year of private tutoring. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So they didn’t know where I would fit in. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So I would meet with different teachers from -- or heads of departments, say math department, English department. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And they would give me, sort of tests on their own or speak to me, and so -- and then they February 27, 2001 decided where to put me, and they put me in the junior class. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And then, you know, I -- I graduated there in -- in a year and a half and went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  How did you get along with your classmates, I mean could you -- did you relate, did they -- did you talk about where you came from at all? </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Did you understand where they were coming from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  Oh they just looked -- you know, th-this was some -- in those days there were not very many foreigners. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So I was the green immigrant. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Everybody asked you how do you like <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and I hadn’t seen much of anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">But no, they were extremely friendly, except for the fact that they tried to sell me elevator tickets, they were all very nice, and I- | participated in sports, I -- on -- on the varsity team, and -- no, I felt very much at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> within -- very reason -- very short time, and the teachers were just wonderful, I must say th-the cr -- the climate was so different from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">The -- the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was very formal, the teachers -- everything was done in a very disciplined, formal way. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">This sort of class president or speaker was designated by the -- by the teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And there was this very democratic life in -- in the American, everything was voted on. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">The academics may not have been as high possibly as in -- as in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but as a -- as a teaching ground for -- for democracy, it -- 1t was quite an experience, it opened my eyes to -- to what a good <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> can do in teaching citizenship more than necessarily academics. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So 1-it was a great experience, I found the teachers extremely helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">February 27, 2001
QUESTION:  Did -- did you ever speak about your experience, or did you have a desire even to do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  No, I didn’t, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">But what was interesting when I reflect -- you ask this question about it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Nobody really wanted to know in those days about the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Nobody asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">They wanted to know where I came from, what I did, and when they -- a-and -- but it went sort of -- it was like asking how are you, you know, you don’t really expect, for one, to get an answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And no, it -- it -- 1t really, there was no great interest in finding out, it was just here was somebody new, he’s come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and he is now our buddy and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But no interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I mean, the interest, 1t’s suddenly over the last 10 years in -- in the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">It was totally nonexistent e-even among older people. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Even my -- my uncle and aunt, my uncle comes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greding</span> , and my aunt from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">They had a club of basically German Jews who -- who’d come from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">They took me in, but nobody really asked where I was, or cared. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">That came -- I think you -- much, much, much later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  Do you think it had to do with not wanting to hurt you, or was it just they did not really have a full understanding of -- of what happened, and just wanted to kind of let it be, or was it also th-the 50’s to some degree, it wasn’t done then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  Yeah, I -- I think -- no, they had an understanding because many of them, of course, had come -- my uncle came to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> in ’38, which was already quite late. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">No, it -- it wasn’t that I -- I -- and I don’t think that it was that they’d wanted to hurt me. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">They were February 27, 2001 just too busy making a living, and life was pretty hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">They had come, like my uncle and aunt at the -- during the depression basically, it wasn’t easy -- 1t wasn’t an easy life, they came with nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And the others were in the same -- same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and they -- they still -- I mean, they would eat on a Saturday or Sunday morning, they would eat all the things that they would have eaten in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and -- but -- but one didn’t very much discuss the war at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Maybe they didn’t want to be reminded of it either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  So you graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and what were your plans? </span><span class="sentence" id="174">You wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="175">If so, was it easy to get in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Well, I have -- or --
QUESTION:  I’m sorry, it’s --
ANSWER:  -- [have to tell you f-funny stories about this, because first of all the -- the Jewish social service person who was supposed to be in charge of me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Patterson</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> said to me, “Oh, you want to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , but in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> you cannot do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">You have to go and work first and earn enough money to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Well, that was the last I ever went to see her again, because I didn’t -- I thought that was just a complete waste of time to get that sort of advice. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I -- I -- I did well in -- wi -- my grades were good, and I had a very good advisor in the -- a college advisor 1-1n the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And she said -- and I knew I wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , I mean there was no question that I wanted to do it, and how I was going to do it, that was another thing, but I knew I was going to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">A -- so she said, well, I’ll give you -- and I had no idea how you went about it, I -- you know, 1 -- February 27, 2001 and since my relatives had not gone to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> here, they ha -- couldn’t really advise me. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">So the -- the advisor, the academic advisor said, “Ill give you the names of 10 <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And they are smaller <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> because it would be better for you to go to a smaller <span class="BUILDING">college</span> where they’d have -- where you’d get acclimated, you’d be part of amer,” -- which was very wise advice. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And she gave me those 10 <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , and I -- and she told me what to do, so you write in and I asked for the catalog. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I did that, and I -- and da -- there was some very fine <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> like <span class="BUILDING">Colgate</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Hamilton College</span> and s-schools of that type. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And one of the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> was <span class="BUILDING">Bethany College</span> in -- in <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">The other <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> that I’d written to, most of them with -- I knew I couldn’t go unless I had a scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">All the other <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> admitted me, but they said we can only give you a scholarship in th -- in a year when we know how your academic performance is going to be, which I guess made sense because I really didn’t much of an academic pedigree. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">But it meant that I really couldn't -- couldn’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And <span class="BUILDING">Bethany College</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to which I’d written and asked for the catalog. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">The catalog came back and it started out by saying this is a Christian college, and so coming from Europe I assumed that that was not a <span class="BUILDING">college</span> where they wanted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And so I didn’t do anything, I put it aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Then one day in -- when I was in class in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , I get a call from the academic advisor saying that there is somebody from <span class="BUILDING">Bethany College</span> downstairs in her <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and he wants to speak to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So I went and spoke with him, and the first thing he said to me was, “Why didn’t you send -- fill out your application?” </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And I wasn’t quite sure how to put this, because it February 27, 2001 was a little delicate, and finally I said, “Look, I am Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">You are a Christian college, and I imagine you’d -- you wouldn’t want me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And he said, “Well, you’re missing the point, this is <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , w-we -- we -- we find your background interesting, we want you to come, we can arrange scholarships for you, and if you work, you can -- and none of this costs too much, you could come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bethany</span> with no money at all and get through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And they were -- so I applied, I got the scholarship, they -- they gave me a job and for the next three and a half years I spend one semester in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I was there and loved it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">QUESTION:  And it was in <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">ANSWER:  In <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  There are two Bethanys, but th -- the one I went to was in <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span> , it’s a Disciples of Christ school, and I must say it was the most tolerant environment from a religious point of view, any <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I’ve ever been. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So it -- it was a -- and it was actually very good for me because it was small enough in those days, the entire <span class="BUILDING">college</span> had 500 or 550 students. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I had some classes with professors where there were just two of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And French literature, or German literature, there were just -- or in history of [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So it -- 1t was a very good experience for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">February 27, 2001
QUESTION:  What was sort of your -- your plans for life at that point? </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Was there a strong focus on wanting to get a profession or did you also start to live, in terms of parties, friends, what - whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  No, I knew -- I knew that if I was going to get any <span class="NPIP">place</span> , I really had to have top grades. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Which doesn’t mean that I lived the life of -- of a monk, but I -- I worked pretty hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And it wasn’t that easy, English was -- so I had to really learn to read and write English, and so it took -- took a lot of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">But 1t was most interesting, I -- I found, for example, I -- I found American history extremely interesting, I -- and -- and I -- I majored in history and sort of emphasized American history, political science, were the things that I just found fascinating. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So 1-it was a lot work, a lot of time, but it was also -- it wasn’t -- I wasn’t bored, I -- it was very exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And I had minored in -- in English, so that I could read things that I wanted to read, so --

QUESTION:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">NYU</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">ANSWER:  Yes, but there is another story to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I was -- I g -- I graduated first from <span class="BUILDING">Bethany College</span> , and <span class="BUILDING">Bethany College</span> recommended me for the Rhodes Scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And -- but I wasn’t a citizen yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So the initial recommendation went to the state of West Virginia, and the person in charge meant I was already qualified to be a citizen so they rushed February 27, 2001 through my citizenship to qualify me for the -- for the Rhodes Scholarship, and then I went and part -- and participated in the interview for the regional Rhodes Scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B
ANSWER:  -- and the big problem was that they asked me a lot of questions, but one question which I couldn’t answer satisfactorily, they said, “Why do you want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="222">You just got here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And I couldn’t -- I couldn’t -- I hemmed and hawed, but the truth was that why would I want to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford</span> if I wanted to be a lawyer in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So I didn’t get the scholarship, not -- not surprisingly. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">But on the way out, as I was walking out, one of the members of the committee said to me, “I’d like to recommend you for a scholarship at <span class="BUILDING">New York University</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And that was the route til -- the scholarship at <span class="BUILDING">New York University</span> , for which I applied, and -- and which I then was awarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And it paid for my entire three years of <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And in those -- it was unbelievable because it paid for -- for everything, and I had 72 dollars a month spending money, books or whatever, which I was the ri -- I was richer than I’ve ever been before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  Now, I don’t ask you what did you do to deserve that honor, I ask you what did you -- how did you get their attention, what did you do so well? </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I mean, was it the grades, or was it also a particular interest in certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> , or --
ANSWER:  Well the -- the -- the Ruth Tilden scholarship was relatively new in those days and you had to -- you had to have a -- your -- grades was one consideration, but also general February 27, 2001 interest in the -- career interest that -- that were different, backgrounds that were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And there were -- we were selected on the basis, again, two people from each judicial circuit in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And the selection was made actually wi -- wi -- usually presided over by a committee that was chaired by the chief justice of a federal -- of a court of appeals in that judicial district. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">In my case it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Richmond</span> , <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION:  So you were interested in law at that point already. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Why law? </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And I think you were also already interested in international law. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Was that true at that time, or was it -- did it come later with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> ”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  No, I was interested -- I -- I always thought at this point already that I would do something where I could use my languages and my -- my -- and my interest in international affairs and -- and politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I knew I was -- wanted to do something in -- in international already in -- when I was in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> -- and I almost left <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> because th-the first year particularly there was nothing that was international and it was quite depressing. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">But then with every year in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> , I -- I got more interested 1n it. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And then I knew that once I got my basic law degree, th-the juris doctor degree, that I wanted to do -- to specialize more, because we only had one course 1n international law in my <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> during my time. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And that’s when I went on -- I went on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">QUESTION:  You had specialized at that time already in international law, and you were also interested in -- in human rights, international human rights at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">What was sort of the standing -- you alluded to it a little bit already, but what was sort of the standing of February 27, 2001 international law within the law community? </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Was it -- didn’t -- did it play a bigger -- a bigger role? </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Was it popular? </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Was it just beginning to -- to come up, or --
ANSWER:  The truth of the matter 1s that if you as a law student were interested in international things, you had no chance in <span class="NPIP">hell</span> to get a job in an int -- in a f -- in a <span class="BUILDING">law firm</span> , because they thought that you were just interested in traveling. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">International was just a luxury that you -- you didn’t practice international law, at least according to the -- to the people in -- in these <span class="BUILDING">law firms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And so, you know, if -- 1f you expressed an interest in international like I did, you were looked upon as some odd character, and they didn’t expect you to have much of a chance of getting anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">As a matter of fact, when I was once asked to interview in one <span class="BUILDING">firm</span> , my friends advised me for heaven’s sake, don’t say anything about international, that you’re interested in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Say you want to be a tough corporate lawyer, and then, you know, you might slip in the fact that you have some interest in international, but never say that’s what you want to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So in that sense, things have changed tremendously in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Today, <span class="BUILDING">law firms</span> take great pride in the fact that they have international law departments. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But in -- in my day, there just didn’t -- didn’t exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Even though there were a number of <span class="BUILDING">law firms</span> that were doing international work, but they didn’t see it th-that way.</span></p>

ANSWER:  I think so -- I -- I must say, I didn’t recognize the potential as -- as I recognized that I was going to do what I wanted to do in terms of my own career plans. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And I -- I feel very strongly that I should do something in the <span class="REGION">international area</span> where I had to -- where I felt that I had -- could make a contribution. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So I was going to do that, regardless of -- of the -- of the obstacles. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And I -- I figured I was going to be able to do it, I mean in retrospect you sort of wonder how foolish one was to think that one could do those things, because it -- 1-1t -- 1f you think of all the obstacles that -- that were there, you m -- you might have decided to do something altogether different. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">But I just couldn’t see myself practicing -- practicing law. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I -- I wanted to do something where I -- where I could sort of -- where I had an advantage in many ways, and where I thought I -- I could do some good. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And to practice law like everybody else, I -- I didn’t have much of a contribution to make, and I wasn’t going to find it very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION:  But it wasn’t just specialize in international law, it was also specializing -- specializing in human rights, which wasn’t exactly on the --
ANSWER:  No, that didn’t even exist, and there I -- it started out, I think, with the perception -- I-I don’t know, I’ve often been asked, wa -- is it my experience that drove me to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I wou -- I’m never quite sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">But 1 -- what I think is true is this, that I felt from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> experience, where we always looked to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> and to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to save us, really, that one had -- that in a situation where one was in trouble from a human rights point of view, one couldn’t rely on the domestic scene or the domestic environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And you had February 27, 2001 to look -- you had to have some international mechanisms that could protect you. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And so I was fascinated to see what was happening in those early days. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">This was in the -- in the late 50’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Really, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights had been adopted in ’°48, but nothing much was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And then in the early 50’s, the European Convention on Human Rights came into being. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And I was fascinated, I wanted to see how did this work, really? </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Is there a chance that this might prevent what I went through? </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And that began to interest me, but it wasn’t only human rights, it was also -- and this is fascinating considering where I am today -- what also interested me was international tribunals. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">As a matter of fact I did my master’s thesis at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> on the <span class="BUILDING">European court</span> of the -- of the - the <span class="BUILDING">common market court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Bec -- I was fascinated to see how this <span class="BUILDING">court</span> operated. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">It -- it wasn’t until a little later that I got interested in the work of the European Court of Human Rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">But it was the europ -- what is today called the European Court of Justice, and in the early days it was still the [indecipherable] community court. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">That’s what I wrote on, is how they went about forcing governments to comply with their decisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So I was interested in compliance mechanisms, how international institutions can have an impact on -- on states and on individuals, and protect individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  So from the very beginning really, bringing two things together, which is the academic interest on the one hand, but also very practical how -- how could policy be influenced, how could -- how could it become a tool, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">February 27, 2001
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I -- wi -- yo -- when you said only academics, the truth of the matter 1s that I wasn’t sure I was going to go into teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">It was a p -- s -- a-actually an accident that I ended up in teaching, because I -- I was at that point working on my masters at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> and there was a -- and I thought of a government job, or a corporate job in international, and there was an opening at -- at the -- wi -- in the U.S. government for an international lawyer who spoke Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And because the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> had just signed an agreement, a compensation agreement with <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and I -- I knew I could get the job because there weren’t very many people around. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So I applied for that job, and -- but they had their usual government budget problems, and I was told the job was mine, the -- if the budget came through. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And so I waited and waited for the -- for the job and it was about March or April and people around me were getting very nervous and I still didn’t have a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Then one day a visiting professor from the <span class="BUILDING">University of Pennsylvania</span> , who was visiting at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> , came in and said, “I heard you’re still waiting for a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">We have a one year teaching job for legal method, available at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Pennsylvania</span> , and if you want it, it’s yours.” </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So that’s how I got into teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And I was teaching legal method, which is really -- the most boring thing 1s to teach people how to write like lawyers and to research law.</span></p>

ANSWER:  I had a very, I suppose, idiosyncratic approach to the Eichmann trial, in which I got into trouble with a lot of people who couldn’t understand my point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I thought it was not a good idea for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to try Eichmann. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I thought it would have been better for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to try Eichmann, because -- [ -- I must say, the fact that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> didn’t have the death penalty, or that <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> had, that is totally irrelevant from my point of view, because whether you kill him or give him a life sentence, y-you’re not going to make up for -- for what he’s done and you’re not going to revive the people that died. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">But symbolically it was very important, I thought, for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to face up to this horrendous- to what this man had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And so doing it in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , while the trial was fair and everything else, was not the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I-It didn’t achieve in my view -- it may have educated Israelis to what happened, but they didn’t really need to be educated as much as the Germans needed to be educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So I’ve always thought that was a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I thought German -- the Israelis should have handed him over to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I don’t think the Germans wanted him, and si -- th-that’s the problem -- that was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ’s problem, but not -- not our problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">So th-th-that was my approach to -- to the Eichmann case.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">QUESTION:  Very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">The other question was late 60’s, mid-60’s, what impact did the civil rights movement have on you, if any? </span><span class="sentence" id="307">February 27, 2001
ANSWER:  Well the -- 1-in a sense, not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">You know, in some ways I was already more preoccupied with what was happening on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">On one hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">On the other hand, the -- the civil rights -- I mean, I was shocked when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> that you s -- one still had separate <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fountains</span> and all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">You know, coming from where I came from, ou-out of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nazi concentration camp</span> , and finding these terrible things that people -- for example, the <span class="BUILDING">movie house</span> in <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span> , African-Americans had to sit on one side of the <span class="BUILDING">movie house</span> , and -- and whites on the other, I mean that to me was shocking, I couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">As a matter of fact, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">water fountains</span> in <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> when I went for an interview were still -- still had segregated signs on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">That was just totally, you know, shocking to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">But I didn’t -- you know, I didn’t get into it, into the civil rights movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I -- I believe very much in what -- what was -- what they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">But it wasn’t something I’d -- I had much to contribute to. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And so I didn’t get -- get involved in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Emotionally I was involved, but not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I mean, I was there in spirit, but not --
QUESTION:  That’s fair enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Okay, let’s go into teaching a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">You were a reluctant teacher at first, but then you became quite an inspired teacher in terms of trying to get the two <span class="DLF">fields</span> that you had chosen, international law, and human rights -- international human rights law incorporated, or strengthened in the curricula and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Could you speak a little bit about the development of your aspirations or your interest as a teacher?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">ANSWER:  Well, once I started teaching at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Pennsylvania</span> [ -- 1-1n that one year, I knew I -- that’s where I belonged, and I knew then what I was going to teach. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And February 27, 2001 actually, the courses I wanted to teach are -- interesting reas -- I wanted to teach about the European Union, th-the <span class="BUILDING">Common Market</span> , which was 1n those days a really revolutionary development. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">When you think that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> could get together after the second World War, and create this union with this purpose, and the European and human rights, of course, the mo -- the emphasis on the European c-convention, and international law, the UN. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">To some extent, to -- I think to many people, all of this seemed to be -- certainly it wasn’t bread and butter for most law students. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">They wanted torts, contracts, property law. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And you know, I d -- I tried to make it as interesting as possible, and I suppose since it was interesting to me, that I was enthusiastic about it, I could always get some students interested in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">But at first when you started -- my -- my first real teaching job after <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> , which was a one year wel -- was at the State University of New York in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And I was told when I was hired that I would get one course, and the three other courses would have to be in American domestic law. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And two of those were courses I’d never even had in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">So it was only gradually that I was allowed -- that -- that there was any interest in the curriculum to add courses in international law. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And t --
QUESTION:  Were there textbooks, actually? </span><span class="sentence" id="334">On human rights, for instance?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">ANSWER:  No, I actually -- together with a former Harvard pr-professor of mine, we wrote the first American international human rights case book. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">It was published in ’73 and that February 27, 2001 really started teaching of international human rights in <span class="BUILDING">American law schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Before that, there were three people teaching human rights in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">QUESTION:  Say something a little bit about that teacher, because he seemed to have had an impact on you, and he was an important person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">ANSWER:  Yeah -- yes, the -- th-the teacher was -- was Professor Louis Soane at the <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Law School</span> , who 1-inspired me f -- f -- and has been sort of my -- was my mentor for -- for many, many years, and a wonderful person. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">The background is interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">He came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in ’39 from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Had a terribly hard time, ended up holding the most important <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> at -- at the <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Law School</span> in international law. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">A-And was a pragmatic idealist, if you -- if there is such a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">A person who always -- others thought he just -- he was just way ou -- out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Yet, he always proved to be right, five, six, 10 years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">About the UN, about human rights, about international developments. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And I found -- when I found him, I found a -- a spirit that could inspire me. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">So it -- and he 1s still alive, he is 87 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">When he retired from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> he went initially to <span class="COUNTRY">Georgia</span> and then I managed to talk him into coming to <span class="BUILDING">George Washington University</span> , where he’s been as distinguished research scholar, professor and still a person from whom I learn a great deal when I see him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">QUESTION:  You also managed to twist a few arms at the American Society of International Law to allow you to establish a study panel because you thought that was important. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Could you February 27, 2001 say something about the panel that you established and why it was important to you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">ANSWER:  Yes, in -- during the period in -- in the 60’s, really, the American Society of International Law was very traditional, conservative if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And human rights, international human rights law was not really considered law. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">It wasn’t my -- the -- the older professors who -- who were the establishment in this society just didn’t believe that- that that was really something that the society should be studying, this -- this was politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And Professor Soane actually encouraged me to write a memorandum to the society, saying that a study panel should be established, and in those days the Ford Foundation was funding these study panels. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Th -- asked me to -- suggested that I write this memorandum, urging the establishment of the study panel, and lo and behold, despite some opposition from various people in -- in the society, the panel was established, and it gave a legitimacy, a credibility to human rights as a -- as a discipline, or branch of international law, which was very important because the society -- the American Society of International Law is a -- is a sort of the body of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> that determines what is and what isn’t international law, and what is important. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And we brought together 30 - some people and produced various papers and held conferences and regionals. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And sort of put human rights, gradually, on that little map.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="367">ANSWER:  Well, I -- I married in my third year in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> , and -- in 1959. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Actually, wa -- 1-it was very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">The -- the scholarship that I was on, the Ruth Tilden scholarship, in those day di -- days, did not allow those of us who had scholarships to get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">The class ahead of us, in the third year, about six of them decided to get m -- and incidentally it was all male. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">No woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Now it 1 -- now it’s a very different program, but in those days only males were admitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And six of the upperclassmen got married in their third year. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And they couldn't throw them all out because they would have thrown out one-third of the -- of the program. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">So they did the next best thing, which was to reduce the scholarship by 500 dollars or something like this, but they -- so the next class, when we -- when we got to this stage, I met my then wife, still in -- in <span class="BUILDING">Bethany College</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">She transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">NYU</span> where I was in -- in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And we got married actually in the <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> , in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> by a judge who -- who had been my -- who was my sponsor. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">We -- and all my classmates from the program were -- were all there. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And we were married in -- in ’59, then a -- we went together to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> in -- in ’60. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Wi -- my -- February 27, 2001 my wife was a music teacher and we had a deal that we would -- we would start a family, or rather she would stop working when I earned about what -- a little more, about half more than sh -- what she was earning as a music teacher, which wasn’t very much so it wasn’t all that difficult in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">She taught in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> while I went to -- while I was at -- at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And then when I got to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Pennsylvania</span> , we decided at that point that we should start a -- a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And our first son, our oldest son was still born in -- while we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , so that was in 1962. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Then we moved - he was only six weeks old when we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> .</span></p>

ANSWER:  Well, what I -- what I found so interesting about her, I-I suppose it explains maybe -- she was so very American. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">That optimism, the -- the thing that there were no limits to what one could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And she had actually been an exchange student in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Quite early on she’d won a scholarship and she spent a year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Braunschweig</span> living with a family and -- and spoke German, had been -- but she was so American in terms of -- of -- and that had a -- had a tremendous appeal to me, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">It was so different. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">None of the repressive things that -- you know, th-the -- my earlier girlfriends, who still had European backgrounds, they were very different.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  Okay, at -- oh, one question -- I was just so absorbed in da -- nodding my head here, that I forgot my question, but the question was, did you talk about where you were coming from, did -- did -- was that -- did that come up, sort of step by step, or did you not really touch much on it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">ANSWER:  Oh yes, no, we talked a great deal about it, because actually I started writing some of my experiences about that time, writing them down. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">A -- as -- I’d written one article about the Death March already in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , but all the other pieces that I wrote, she actually typed and -- and revised, edited them. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And so we -- we talked about -- about that quite a lot.</span></p>

QUESTION:  And this is tape two of the follow-up interview with Judge Buergenthal, conducted by Regina Baier on February 27", 2001. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And in 1970, I believe, I seem to remember in 1970 you began representing the U.S. government at the UNESCO in human rights matters. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And how did that come about and what -- could you give us an example of the kind of things that you were involved in then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  Yes, it -- it was around in the early 1970’s, that I -- I was teaching -- at that point I was still teaching at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> , at the state university of New York, and one of the lawyers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> who became a good friend of mine was -- received a political appointment to serve on the U.S. delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And he knew very little about international human rights, but was very interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And so he asked me to brief him, and give him backgrounds on -- on what was happening in the <span class="DLF">human rights field</span> in the world at the time, which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And then after that experience that he had, he became a member of the U.S. National Commission for UNESCO, which was sort of the state department’s private support body for -- for UNESCO. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And he involved me in the work, and he -- he is -- he became the chairman of their human rights committee, and made me a member of the -- of the committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And than I was elected, eventually, to the -- to the U.S. national commission, and then I succeeded him as -- as chairman of the commission. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">In the meantime, in 1974, I was asked to chair a U.S. delegation to a UNESCO meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And what we were doing there basically -- this was of course at the height of the -- of February 27, 2001 Cold War, were the -- human rights was not something -- human rights was basically used in many quarters just as a propaganda tool, one way or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And m-my delegation, we -- we tried to -- to do it right. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">We -- we managed to get -- they had a draft that had been prepared, we managed to get 82 amendments adopted for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">My -- my -- my colleague at the time was a -- was a professor of child psychology who had done a lot of work on children’s attitudes -- international attitudes. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And we worked this -- and we lobbied, and we managed to actually get a great deal done, to everybody’s surprise because I think when we were put on this delegation everybody thought this was just giving a few people a free trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , but nothing was going to come out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And when we came back, we suggested to the U.S. government -- because we then managed to adopt the resolution that -- that should be written up. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">The -- and the -- the people at the state department, in charge of UNESCO said to us, well why don’t you write it up? </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And that produced a book on this recommendation that had been -- that had been adopted, and led to my involvement and -- on human rights issues -- anything relating to human rights at <span class="BUILDING">UNESCO</span> at that point, I was involved in one way or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Eventually, up to really 1960 -- no, let me see, ’78 - ’79, when I was elected to the inter-American court, and I was -- I dre -- I was part of the -- I was th -- chairing the delegation of the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> that managed to adopt rules for private appeals to UNESCO for human rights violations. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Again things that nobody thought we were going to be able to get through, but it was adopted. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">It was very exciting, it was my first experience in an international gu -- inter- February 27, 2001 governmental forum. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And that’s where I began, really, to get some practical experience in international human rights as a government representative. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And it was -- wa -- 1n sense, wonderful to be there representing the -- the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> because I could see my colleagues from the east particularly, who had to continuously check their instructions and had to adhere to their instructions and I also had the feeling that if they made a mistake they would end up being in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , whereas all that could happen to me would be that I wouldn’t be put on the next delegation. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">But you had much more freedom to negotiate, and I thought we -- we achieved some things, and it -- in these -- this context, I learned very early in those days that you -- you c -- you shouldn’t have great expectations of great achievement, but step by step, you put one brick on top of the other, a-and you get some things done. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And in those days it was easier to talk about human rights education, because it was not seen by many of the dictatorial governments as being threatening. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">What they didn’t realize is that in the long run human rights education is much more dangerous to them than some more advocacy oriented course, because if you begin to teach children about -- that they have rights, that can have an impact. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And so we f -- I focused on that for -- for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">But that was -- I found that as a -- a fascinating experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Then of course, at some point, the U.S. withdrew from UNESCO. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I was elected to the inter-American court of human rights, and had to stop my involvement with UNESCO. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I always thought it was a mistake that we left UNESCO, the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , I mean.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">QUESTION:  You also, I think, tried to involve parents in this [indecipherable] didn’t you? </span><span class="sentence" id="444">February 27, 2001
ANSWER:  Yes, we -- what we did, actually, when we came back from this first conference, we decided in connection with the book we had written that we should get <span class="BUILDING">American schools</span> involved in teaching about international human rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And so what we did was we organized a number of meetings with curriculum writers for <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> and grade schools and we got some fundings from various foundations. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And th-that proved to be quite interesting, because within a few years you could see international issues like the universal declaration [indecipherable] coming into textbooks that were used in -- in <span class="BUILDING">American high schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">It’s now probably much more -- I’ve lost track, but in those days that -- that was quite unique. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">But we -- we did that for a number of years and got a lot of people interested in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">QUESTION:  You infiltrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  We infiltrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION:  And then came --
ANSWER:  Because you know, I -- I think what is -- what is so often lost to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , we have as a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> so much to offer in this <span class="DLF">field</span> , in terms of our experience with -- with human rights, with civil rights, and -- and with the court system over the fact that these issues are litigated in <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> , that -- that they are not fought on in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Yet, when it comes to making a contribution, on our contributing also in other parts of the world, a- and getting involved in these activities, we shy back and we -- we think that this is somehow threatening to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">On the contrary, we have an obligation to contribute what we February 27, 2001 know in this <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">So I -- I’ve always felt that this was a very important job, I -- and I liked 1t very much, it was great.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  And then c -- and then came a period, late 70’s until ’91, I believe, that you called in the earlier interview, in some way -- quote now, in some ways one of the most in- interesting periods in your life, and that was your -- that you became a member, and eventually also president of the inter-American court of human rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Could you say something about that particular <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , and what -- what you did was -- what your involvement was there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">ANSWER:  Well, I should tell you first how I got on the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , or rather it -- it’s just interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I - at that point I was teaching at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Texas</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Austin</span> at their <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And I -- I used to teach a seminar every year on international human rights, and one part of the seminar dealt with the inter-American system. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And I would in every seminar say what a pity it was that the U.S. had not ratified the American convention on human rights, because it meant that an American would never sit on the inter-American court of human rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And then one day I was sitting in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on one of those sunny days in - hot days in <span class="REGION">Texas</span> and the phone rang, and somebody with a Latin American accent identified himself as coming from the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span> , and said that he was calling to ask whether I would permit <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span> the honor of nominating me to the inter-American court of human rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And I was sure it was one of my students playing games with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">So I very carefully said, “Of course, Mr. Ambassador, I’m profoundly February 27, 2001 honored, but I need to speak to my wife.” </span><span class="sentence" id="464">You know, one of those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And, “Would you mind giving me your telephone number that I -- I will call you back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And of course, as soon as he gave me the telephone number, I checked to see what the telephone number was for the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> of Costa Rica, and it was really <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And I -- I think I accepted the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I thought it was nice to -- to wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And that’s how I ended up on the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">I had actually been interested in being on the commission, like -- the inter- American human rights system has a commission and a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , and on the commission, the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> does have a representative. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">A -- a member. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And so I tha -- that was my hope, I never expected to be on the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">The great thing, and the reason I said it was such a wonderful experience, I was one of the seven first members of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">We established the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">We held our first meeting in the <span class="BUILDING">bathhouse</span> of the Costa Rican bar association. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">We had one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> , that’s how it started. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And it’s now -- and then for the next -- I had two terms, and I was re-nominated by <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span> and by <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span> and I served for -- for 12 years on the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , and we really laid -- in those -- we had some bi -- I had some wonderful colleagues, and we laid the groundwork for a human rights tribunal which today is playing an important role. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">It’s not as significant still as the -- as the European Court of Human Rights, which 1s much older now, but it is doing some good, and it’s trying to -- to have an important role 1n -- in <span class="REGION">Latin America</span> , particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">So in that sense, to -- to be at the inception of all of this, it was a tremendous experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION:  Did you deal -- did you deal with cases of disappearance at that time? </span><span class="sentence" id="481">That was -- February 27, 2001
ANSWER:  Yes, as a matter of fact, the -- the f -- the f -- important disappearance cases, the first three came to the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> when I was still president of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And it -- 1t was -- this was- these were cases involving disappearances in <span class="COUNTRY">Honduras</span> that had taken place in -- between 1979 and ’82, in -- during that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And the -- the cases carried on for a number of years, but the decision that we rendered was -- was really the f -- the first international decisions dealing with the whole issue of disappearances. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And we awarded damages to the families of the disappeared, they were -- they were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And I had then the great satisfaction, after I was no longer on the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , of receiving the payment on behalf of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , from the government of <span class="COUNTRY">Honduras</span> , the compensation payment that was still due to the victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">That was much later, th-that was -- took place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">That is a -- you have a sense you’ve done something. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And th-those were terrible days, and of course in <span class="COUNTRY">Honduras</span> the disappearances were much less than what had happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">But <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> was not part of the system yet at that time, whereas <span class="COUNTRY">Honduras</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And -- and, you know, having played that role, and having had to listen to the witnesses, and we lost a number of witnesses who were killed in <span class="COUNTRY">Honduras</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">So it was a -- a terrible experience in one way, and a [indecipherable] gratifying experience in the sense also of laying the foundation for the [indecipherable] subject, and also establishing the principle that the government has responsibilities and has to compensate the victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">February 27, 2001
QUESTION:  At that time I believe, a disappearance sort of emerged, or the disappearances emerged as sort of the new phenomenon to some degree, but was it also -- did it also remind you of the Holocaust in some ways? </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Were there aspects that were sort of similar to --
ANSWER:  Less so there than -- than on the truth commission, where I s-served later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Of course, you know that when they describe tortures and things like this, you -- but -- but the -- the killings were not on the mass level that the things that we encountered in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">EI Salvador</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="495">The -- the thing that -- that stru -- has struck me always in my work in human rights is the different -- that some of the people who commit these acts have no -- no s-s -- I don’t know, 1-it’s not question of conscience, but if we -- j-just to give you an example, we -- we had one man who testified as a witness, had been involved in this, and we asked, were they tortured? </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And he said, “No, they weren’t tortured,” But -- and we said, “Well you had this woman standing there for 24 hours naked 1n this <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , trying to get a confession in front of men.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="497">Well, that wasn’t torture.” </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Y-You know, the different notion of what is torture, if y -- 1f you don’t hit somebody over the head, then it’s okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">It- It -- it’s just form of interrogation. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And the justification, how you can justify all of these acts because some notion of national security is involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I-It -- 1t runs through, and- and there is -- there are no <span class="DLF">national borders</span> in that, it -- you find it every <span class="NPIP">place</span> , from -- from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , where you could justify murdering Jews because they were unterMenschen, they weren’t human beings, to what happened in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salvador</span> or someplace else, different ethnic groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Communists, or fascists or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">In that February 27, 2001 sense there is a universality among these criminals th-that 1s shocking in some re -- to some extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">QUESTION:  You just mentioned that you also worked for the UN truth commission for <span class="COUNTRY">El Salvador</span> , that was also almost 12 years that you were involved in that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">ANSWER:  No, no, that was -- we had a mandate of -- of six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">The -- the war in <span class="COUNTRY">El Salvador</span> lasted for 12 years, but we were asked after the -- the peace accords had been signed to investigate what had happened during those 12 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And th-there were three of us, basically, were the members of the commission,; a former president of Columbia and a former foreign minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Venezuela</span> and I, with a staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And basically our job was to -- to try to determine responsibility on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , on the <span class="REGION">guerilla side</span> and on the <span class="REGION">government side</span> for some of the terrible acts that happened, for example, the killing of the archbishop Romero, the killing of the Jesuits, the -- the rapes and killings of the church women. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">The El Mozote massacre, the killings by the [indecipherable] of various mayors, and so that -- that was our job. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And there, in various contexts, the Holocaust came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I -- I remember the one survivor whom we interviewed on the massacre of El Mozote, it was in the -- in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> where they murdered -- it’s very hard to say, I would think about 800 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">The woman who was describing that started talking about how it happened, and I could have finished the story in terms of my own experience, what the soldiers were doing, how they were doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">It was just as if I -- if I had been there. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Similar things with, for example, the killing of the Jesuits. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I remember -- I had just been February 27, 2001 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> about a year earlier and had told my wife how -- we -- we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , this was in May, and I said to her, you know what is most unbelieving about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> where I was, that the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> is growing, it’s about two, three feet high and birds are flying. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">When I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , there was not -- there was only mud, and there were no birds because of the smoke from the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="517">When we were in <span class="COUNTRY">El Salvador</span> , in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> where they had executed the Jesuit fathers, somebody pointed to a <span class="BUILDING">tower</span> where supposedly there’d been ob-observers, and he said -- this was a -- a -- th-the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> they had planted roses. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And they said, right over there, over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> , and -- but it’s now overgrown, you can’t see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And it brought back <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">You couldn’t see what had happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">So one doesn’t lose those things in different environments, but -- and it came back in many contexts, in context of people in <span class="COUNTRY">El Salvador</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I’ve never heard in -- anybody in <span class="COUNTRY">El] Salvador</span> say that they were sorry for what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">They only said that it was a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Wa -- I’ve never quite understood what that meant, that it was a mistake that if they had done it better, I suppose they could have -- and those are the things we are struggling with, we are dealing with when we are dealing with human rights violations, that we have to create in the world a sense that these are no -- not mistakes. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">These are terrible things for which people should be sorry, and they should know that they will be, that they’Il be on their conscience and they shouldn’t be doing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">That’ll take a -- a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">But it -- 1t was striking to me, I’d -- February 27, 2001 I'd never thought about it until I had to interview some of these people on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Never heard the word sorry.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">ANSWER:  So all of those things -- an -- and on that point what 1s -- what is also interesting, there is a universality among these criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">That is to say, wh-when I read Solzhenitsyn’s a- about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">gulag</span> , it was no different from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Th-There was -- there are limits to the lack of ingenuity in which human beings commit crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And -- and you see it, I think, what we saw in <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> , what we now saw in <span class="REGION">East Timor</span> with -- what we saw in <span class="COUNTRY">El Salvador</span> , what we saw in -- the terrible things that happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> during the so-called dirty war. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Where you -- where you have, for example, people murdering a pregnant woman and then taking the child of the woman as their own, which I -- to-to me is the most -- it’s the ultimate in -- 1n insanity, in criminal insanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">That’s the kind of work I was doing.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Well, what choice do we have? </span><span class="sentence" id="541">It -- it’s really -- I mean, we either accept that this is how it has to be, or you say, we’re going to try to see whether we can improve it, whether we can prevent this from happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">For our children, our grandchildren, it -- it has to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And even if you know that it’s -- it -- 1t may not -- you may not be always successful, it’s important to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And it -- situations have improved, I mean it’s -- there are -- you know, when I -- when you see many of the young people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> today, things -- I -- I find the German youth to be more European than the youth of -- of many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Human rights education, democracy education had -- had a serious impact. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I think the problems that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> has today is that -- that education, which was done in <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> on democracy, was not done with the East Germans when they joined. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And they just assumed that if they watched West German television and -- and ate West German food that suddenly they would be democrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And so now you have the skinheads and some of these problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">But I think the German experience, at least in the west, 1s gratifying in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And, you know, there is hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And what is happening in <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in <span class="REGION">Latin America</span> , where you suddenly see <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> today, for example -- even <span class="COUNTRY">El Salvador</span> , things have -- have improved now, they have a lot of crime and other things, but politically things, they have elections and so, you know, you -- you have reason to go on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">QUESTION:  I just have a cu -- while I’m listening to you I just have couple of different kinds of questions related to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">You just said <span class="REGION">Latin America</span> , did you bring -- you brought your February 27, 2001 own perspective, experience as a Holocaust survivor to this to some degree, but you also are bringing, probably, a North American perspective. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Did -- did you ever feel that you have sort of North American perspectives in -- in your work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  You know, I’ve -- I’ve -- it’s strange, I -- I’ve never se -- I’m very proud of being an American in the sense that I -- I’ve often thought it’s -- p-proud in the sense that if you -- that I had to become an American. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Others were born into being an American, and -- and - and | -- there’s enough about the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> -- the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> has been very good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I admire a great deal that has happened, that the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> does and has done and that it stands for in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">There’s a lot of things that I -- that I don’t find admirable. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">But I’ve never thought of myself in any way when I go someplace, as an American in the sense of somebody who’s wrapped around the flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I -- I think of myself a-as a American citizen who is asked to do a job and tries to do it in -- in the way he thinks it should be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">But not thinking of it that, you know -- I certainly don’t feel that I have to bring <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to <span class="REGION">Latin America</span> or anything like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">But I think that in some <span class="REGION">areas</span> <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> could learn a great deal from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , but I think it’s true also the other way around. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And w-we -- we don’t have a monopoly on -- on wisdom, and -- and we sometimes think we do, an-and I -- I think that’s -- that’s bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">QUESTION:  I guess I didn’t mean it quite so crudely, I was just thinking a strong emphasis on individual rights, for instance, tends to be a part of -- of the outlook of the -- this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , but -- February 27, 2001
ANSWER:  But a -- but I think, in my case, the -- the cr -- the commitment to individual rights is probably less influenced by <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> as much as by my own experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">I -- I’ve sort of start with the assumption that -- that people should be treated the way I want to be treated, and would like to be treated, and -- and that is universal a notion, I think, in -- that’s how you can build a whole human rights system on that basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So when people come to me and say human rights are relativistic I always ask, does that mean that the people who say that want to be -- that in some <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> that they really want to be killed, that they want to have their arms chopped off, that they want to have these things done to them? </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Or are they just excuses by the leaders who -- who want to violate their rights?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">QUESTION:  What makes for a good human rights lawyer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">ANSWER:  First of all, somebody who really knows his stuff as a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">One of the big damage that -- mu-much damage has been done to human rights advocacy by people who politicize it as lawyers. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I mean, it’s all right if you’re a politician and you want to politicize it, but the job of a lawyer, particularly in investigating and bringing claims has to be one that is as professional and sound, professionally lawyer-like as you can be, because you -- if you’re not, you open yourself up to charges your -- you weaken your case. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And that -- a lot of that used to happen because we didn’t have trained human rights lawyers around, so people would make big speeches and claim that they had found certain things, and then they were proved wrong and -- and they suffered in terms of prestige. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">So to my mind the most important thing is for lawyers in this business to February 27, 2001 recognize that they have to be as good lawyers in that <span class="DLF">field</span> as if they ran in corporations, anti-trust lawyers, tax lawyers. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">So that’s -- that’s the first requirement. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">The second requirement is that you really have to have empathy. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">You have to feel that -- that this is something that is important, that this 1s -- this isn’t just like any other field of the law, that this is something where you -- you have to put your heart into it, and you don’t have to necessarily work as a human rights lawyer to do that, you could work for a corporation, you can be in a big <span class="BUILDING">law firm</span> , and you can on the side do a lot of good, human rights work. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">But you have to believe in it.</span></p>

ANSWER:  First of all, I was a member of an advisory group originally that was involved when President Carter established the -- the Holocaust Commission, he also established an advisory group to the commission, and I was member of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And the issue at that point was debated whether to have a <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And | thought it was a mistake to have it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Again, I thought it should be in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and- and not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Since then I’ve come to the conclusion I’ve been wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Not that it shouldn’t -- that there shouldn’t be one in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but they -- the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> has been a tremen -- has had an tremendous educational impact on people in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , in terms of educating them to what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">When I would go to meetings at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> to -- to -- you know, we had council meetings and committee meetings, it was always impressive to see the thousands of kids lining up to go to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And the hush that fell over them when they -- when they went in. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">So -- and -- and | think in -- in five years there were more than eight million people that had come to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="730">So I think it’s had a tremendous impact. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">That Committee on Conscience was something that was very close to my heart, because I feel very strongly that the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> shouldn’t be just a -- a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="732">The <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> has to be a living organism that tries to make sure that these things don’t happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And that means also, speaking out to -- to where other crimes against humanity and genocide is being committed. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And we have an obligation as survivors, and we owe it to the people who died to make sure that these things don’t happen in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And so -- and that was really the function of the Committee on February 27, 2001 Conscience, and I felt that I -- if -- if -- if that’s not what the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> was doing, then I didn’t want to be connected with it, because I had other things to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">But the establishment of the committee -- and it took a long time, they -- there were internal squabbles which I wasn’t involved in, to establish it. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">But once it was established, I found that was really worthwhile, and ith -- and very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And I’m glad I -- I of course had to resign from the Committee on Conscience because it speaks out on issues today, and on this <span class="BUILDING">court</span> I -- I cannot be involved in anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">But I think it’s very -- it’s a very important role, very important what is happening there. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Was something else I was going to mention to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">It is -- well --
QUESTION:  Maybe it’ll come back to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">We are kind of winding down, but of course I always have a couple of additional questions that -- you just said, I have other things to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Now, over the last eight years at least, you had a lot of things to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">You were on separate commissions and I’m not sure we have to mention them necessarily, but if you think about those last six to eight years, what do they mean in the context of your overall work? </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Is there anything in particular that you would like to say because something has come to a conclusion in the way you -- in your philosophy of international rights, or -- or human rights, that you have taken a new direction, or just something, anything that comes to mind that you might want to --
ANSWER:  No, what comes to mind, less dramatic, is the fact that it -- there seems to be some sort of poetry -- not poetic justice, but a certain justice that has poetic, or non-legal aspect to February 27, 2001 it. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And that is that somebody with my background should be involved in these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">That I should be on the Truth Commission for <span class="COUNTRY">El Salvador</span> , that I should be on the Inter- American Court of Human Rights, that I should sit on the UN Human Rights Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">That -- in a sense wh-what is impressive about it is not my career in that those things are often happenstance and anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">But what is significant about it that it should give faith to people who believe -- who do -- people who are cynical a-about what can be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">The fact that a survivor of these things can still today have a role in trying to prevent some of these things from happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">That, to me, has always been the sort of significant aspect of -- of my activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I would sit there and sometimes say gee, this is really, you know -- why was I granted this privilege? </span><span class="sentence" id="753">That -- that, to me, has been the -- the sort of most significant aspect. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">This is an -- an example of the fact that one can overcome si -- n-not per -- I personally, but that we can overcome some of these murderous things that have happened, and still be able to work for a better world. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And -- and the fact that I could serve on these things indicates that there 1s reason to be optimistic about things. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">I -- I spoke once in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I think, in connection when I- when I got the honorary degree, and I said I -- I thought -- it’s so wonderful when you think that when you go down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> and when you remember that the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> was reinforced on both sides between <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with cannons and today you don’t even need a passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">There’s tremendous things that have happened, that should give us a Sense of optimism. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Yet, you know, the cynics keep saying nothing is changing. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">February 27, 2001 Lots of terrible things happening, but then, a lot of good things have been happening and that -- that should inspire people to -- to want to do things. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">In my current position I -- I can no longer be an advocate, I -- I have to sit on my hands, try to apply the law. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And that in itself is -- is a good discipline.</span></p>
