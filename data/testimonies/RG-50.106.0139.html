<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  Well, I think I was very strong and that probably saved my life when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Were you very independent?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Well, when you’re in a family of seven, you got to be independent.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And with your parents, before conditions got worse, were they the kind of people that you could talk things over with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Now looking back on it, I think my parents were trying to hide many things from me, that things will get better. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I mean, I remember when they were saying, honey, don’t worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Things will get better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  When Hitler came into power in 1933 and until the Germans occupied your -- your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , did your life change in any way? </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Preceding the time that the Germans occupied your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Well, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> became <span class="COUNTRY">Hungaria</span> in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">It had changed somewhat, but not to the extent what has happened in 19 f -- when the Germans came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  So life went on for you, relatively the same?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Not the same at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Was not --
QUESTION:  What -- what were some of the changes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  Well, I think the Jewish kids did not have the same opportunity going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as the non-Jewish kids, where -- and I lived under the Czechs, my uncle was a Czech officer, and after we'll be finished with this interview, I’ll show you a picture of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So th-that -- that we lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And we started sort of educating ourselves on our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">What happened was we were allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but we wal -- we had to sit in the back and we were never called on. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So what my father did is he February 21, 2001 got a -- a teacher and we -- we s -- he -- he -- he was teaching us. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And after awhile, the whole communities, you know, the Jewish kids came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">So when a - | think back, I feel like our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> became the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , actually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  What was it like for you as a young person to experience anti-Semitism? </span><span class="sentence" id="46">What did it mean to you as a young child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  Well, when you’re young you don’t understand a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Here you had friends today and tomorrow you lost them, and you wondered why. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And that was very painful for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  And did you talk this over with your -- your siblings or your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  We did. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We constantly talked about it because we worried about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">But we were always living in hope that things will get better, but they didn't get better, they got worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  Did you know earlier that -- what was happening to the Jews in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , before the germ -- like all of this is before the German occupation of your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Did you know what was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Well, you know, we had a radio and that was taken away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So people, some people took a chance in keeping their radios, but you could have been punished for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So we gave our radio away. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But there was some people took the -- a chance on keeping it, so during the night they would be listening to the news. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So February 21, 2001 the news would come through, but we -- we -- we couldn’t understand, we didn’t understand how severe the tragedy was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Did you have any other interests? </span><span class="sentence" id="62">You were still young, but besides <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , did you -- music or reading, anything th-that you did to occupy your time besides schoolwork?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  Constantly reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Matter of fact, I loved books and well, actually our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> al-always was full of books. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And I had a little brother, he was six years old, and he had a little book, they called it “All of Base,” it’s a ABC book and poor kid, he was carrying this book with him until he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and they told him to throw this little book into a -- the -- the <span class="DLF">pit</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">It was very difficult for him, he cried a lot about it, but --
QUESTION:  And when it was time for you to have to wear a yellow star, what were your feelings about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  My feelings were awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I feared for every minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">At that time, no matter how my parents wanted to protect me, it just was right there in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I could no longer -- I'll -- Pll never forget that. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I -- my uncle gave me a quarter to go and get myself ice cream, to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I used to go and get this ice cream, it was a big treat for a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And I got there -- at a certain time, we couldn’t walk out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I believe 1t was between five and six. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And I got there, they told me they February 21, 2001 cannot sell me the ice cream because I was a Jewish child. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> crying and I didn’t understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So the pain was there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  There was very little to comfort me because everything was staring in my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">How -- what could they say to me when a little kid comes <span class="BUILDING">home</span> crying they didn't get a ice cream, even though I had my quarter. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">It was -- it was sad.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Well, when we parted in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I don’t know if I should mention <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , how we parted. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Can I an --
QUESTION:  Absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Well, when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we came with the whole family and my -- you know, my parents -- but the two older brothers were taken away already for February 21, 2001 work, to s-s -- t -- t-to the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> where they were picking <span class="DLF">mines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And my father, and I had an older sister, and she took care of my grandmother, and my grandfather came and my little brother and my mother and my sister that survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> they pushed my mother with my sister because she looked fairly young, but they pulled my little brother out of her hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So my mother heard him cry, so she ran back to him and pleaded with the Germans to -- to let her go with my little brother and they beat her up, and after she was bleeding, and they kicked her into the <span class="DLF">left lane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And she was screaming, please tell the world what is happening to us, if you survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Try to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Actually her words were like that, try to survive, and if you do, tell the world what happened here. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And of course, you know, my grandfather also had a terrible experience there. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I don’t know if I can go on talking about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  Can I talk about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  Whatever you wish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Well, my grandfather came -- well, they took him from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">He -- he had the Torah scroll with him, because when they closed our <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> , he managed to take out a Torah scroll. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> became a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I think his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> became a <span class="BUILDING">house of worship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And when they told us we have to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , he took the Torah scroll with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , he came February 21, 2001 down from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with this Torah scroll and they made -- they -- they told him to- to throw the Torah scroll into the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> and he wouldn’t do that, so you know, he- they were beating on him and we ran over to him and pleaded with him, please, please throw the Torah scroll down and he just wouldn’t do it and they kept on beating on him and then th -- they really -- you know, they beat him to death and right in front of us he fell with the Torah scrolls, and -- so we saw this tragedy right in front of us, and I think in -- that’s what f -- then they took my grandfather and they threw him in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And I think she kept that in mind all the time, that she needs -- she has a need to tell this to someone. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And that -- I think that -- that made her stronger, to say I have to survive to tell it to someone what happened, because I don’t think they’ Il believe it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Were there any other examples of women helping other women in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> while you were there? </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Can you -- do you know of any other situations? </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Your sister, of course, helped you. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Did you see that relationship between any other women, or other women to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  Well, you must understand, when people are put in a situation where survival is the only thing, so it was very difficult to help each other because we were all in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , with the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">But we -- we did try. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">You know, if we saw somebody fainted we were there for them, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">But there was nothing we really can do to help them, they probably, you know, they were fainting out of February 21, 2001 hunger or -- or weakness. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And it was -- it was very, very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">It wasn’t that one had more than the other to be able to help each other, it wasn’t like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">When my sister tried keeping me alive when I was giving up, she just gave away her little piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">You know, she like bribed me, sort of, to -- to want to -- to want to surv -- you know, that I should survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But I -- I -- I think what happened to me, I emotionally did not want to do it any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And a -- and a -- of course, I was very weak because I had to work so hard in the <span class="BUILDING">munition factory</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">When you were in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , did you talk about what was going on with the other women, outside of your sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  We saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">We were right there with them, we were in one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  But I meant, did you exchange feelings with each other, the other women?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  I think everybody was just numb, and everybody -- everybody just didn’t understand what is happening because we -- we weren’t treated as human beings any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So --
QUESTION:  Were you with women from your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , or were you with women from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  When I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , the time when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I was there with a lady and my next door neighbor and her daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And I don’t remember, somebody else there. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">But then when they took us to work they took them someplace else and they took me and my sister someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">February 21, 2001
QUESTION:  What -- what was the -- or -- the name of the <span class="BUILDING">munitions factory</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Do you know where -- where in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> it was, or what the name was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  I really don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I should really find out because it’ll -- probably I have to -- I -- I - | -- I’ve -- I’m going to try to find out where it was, but I don’t think it was far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">It wasn’t far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , but I don’t reme -- I-I just don’t know, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  Now, you were almost 17 years old when you were liberated by the British. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Did you know what those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> meant when you saw them at the time of -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British tanks</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="145">What -- what did it mean to you to see them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  Well -- well let me tell you first what <span class="NPIP">position</span> we were in. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">We -- we were full of life, we were thrown in with other people that were half dead, and 1 -- I was burned up from the m -- from -- from the spring stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">From the gunpowder, or whatever, I- | remember it was yellow and very hot and while I was filling these bombs, you know, of course some of it went on top of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So we were really like half dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But my sister, you know, she noticed them first. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And I sa -- you know, so she tells me, you know, there are some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> out there and they don’t look like they’re <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So I said to her, you know, maybe this is the end and things will be better. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So she says, it’ll be probably be better for the world, but for us it’s too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So when the Germans came, we really didn’t have the strength to be happy and --
QUESTION:  When the British came, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">February 21, 2001
ANSWER:  When the British came, that my -- yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">They came a little bit too late for m -- actually for a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">My -- when they came my sister was already sick in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , I remember she was delirious. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And then the British opened up the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and when they looked into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , it was terrible because they wouldn’t let us out to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Everybody was doing everything they needed at -- in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and a | -- a lot of them were very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">It just -- they opened -- they probably thought it was worse -- it was -- really was worse than a crazy <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So they were asking us what they can do for us, and they tried very hard to help us, but as I said, it was a little too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">They took my sister and I didn’t know where sh- they took her. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So she didn’t return a few days, I went out to look for her because at that ti -- after the English came in they posted names who died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen</span> and I couldn’t find her. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">But the sight ve seen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> | still have nightmares about it.</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="459">I'll wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I have no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go and no -- nothing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Pll wait at -- and a -- I -- I -- I was watching where he was going and I saw him go to the same man that just told me that he doesn’t have a job for me and I thought I was going to faint. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And he was standing there and standing there with this man, and standing there and talking to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And then he finally comes back and he says to me, come back tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I says, tomorrow? </span><span class="sentence" id="465">What time? </span><span class="sentence" id="466">He said nine o’clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">When I came back, I stayed near the <span class="DLF">door</span> , eight o’clock I was already there waiting the <span class="DLF">door</span> -- for the <span class="DLF">door</span> to be opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And finally I went in there, into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Shall I continue? </span><span class="sentence" id="470">A -- so anyway, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , they took one look at me and as I said, I didn’t look February 21, 2001 so presentable. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">It was a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And he must have promised his father, that was the son of this old man, he was the boss and I didn’t know at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So this man wouldn’t leave the son until he would promise him he’ll give me some kind of a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">So they looked at me and they had -- it was a very big <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they had their own designers and were so many secretaries in this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">So the de -- I don’t know, I think she was one of the designers, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">She takes one look at me and she says to me, you never go shopping. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I's -- wi -- I said to her, you know, there is a problem, I don’t have no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">She takes another look at me, she says, well don’t worry about it, we'll -- we’ll bill it to the -- to the company. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">So I had no choice, I go with her and this lady, I tell you, she knew exactly what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">She knew exactly what to do with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">She -- she took me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I remember they were smaller <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Now that I know there’s -- was <span class="BUILDING">Macy’s</span> and everything, but she didn’t want to waste time. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">So she took me into these smaller <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and took out different dresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And every time she brought a dress for me to put on -- first of all, I -- you know, I didn't have a bra, I didn’t have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Sh -- so she got me a little bra and stockings, she put stockings on me, I never had stockings in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And she -- we -- we bought a pair of shoes with a little heel, I think it was an inch and a half, or -- and she tells me I should get dressed and then she brings these dresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I says, you know, they’re so expensive, I -- you know, and I don’t have any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">She says, don’t worry about it, just put it on. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">So I put it on and I tell February 21, 2001 you, I looked like a different person. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">You know, I just looked like a different person. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Then she went and took my -- my hair was raw, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">She took my hair and put it in a bun, and then she put a little lipstick on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And she bought a lot of clothes that I wasn’t paying much attention because it was scaring me. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And we went back and we got into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and -- and I tell you, I did look different, I must say. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And so the boss came in and he took a look in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> because he was in the main <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you know, watching the workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And I saw him looked at -- looking at me twice, like to say well, is that the same girl? </span><span class="sentence" id="498">So, anyway, then they gave me a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">They had a vy -- like a [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , where very rich ladies came in to pick out skins for their coats. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I didn’t realize how rich these women were at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And they were training me on what to say to them and how to deal with them and in no time I was so anxious to hold this job that -- and then I-I didn’t mind staying after the time, or I never went down for lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I would- my sister would give me a Jell-o sandwich, I would quickly eat it right there, and I was trying my best they should keep me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And after awhile -- after awhile they saw how -- I became a good thing for them, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">You know, they paid me, they paid me well and I became a good thing for them too, because whatever they needed, or -- they could do with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And then had models when -- whenever a buyer would come from a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , they would call a -- a model, or a few models, matter of fact, and they came in, it was a very big <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">So one time I February 21, 2001 became lucky and a model didn’t show up, and you know, that lady, she says, well, why don’t we call in Helen? </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So they called Helen in and I came there and they said to me, listen, put on this coat and take a walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">You know, on a walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I put on the coat and I took a walk, and you know, I was younger, taller, I tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">A- Anyway, I took a walk and this buyer said to me, take another walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I smiled at him and I took another walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And it went well, you know, it went well. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">So finally that lady said to the boss, let’s send her to <span class="BUILDING">modeling school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">So -- so they send me to <span class="BUILDING">modeling school</span> for a few hours, but I still had to come into <span class="BUILDING">work</span> to get my paycheck. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">After a few weeks, what happened was they told me the same thing, yen- you know, put your chest out, you know, lift your head, walk graciously. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">You know, how many times do you need to be told what to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="517">So I walked over to her, I says, listen, I don’t mind going there, but it seems to me like I know everything already what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And I did it, you know, I sort of did it -- evidently a good job because then, when a buyer would come in, they would ask, is Helen going to be there?

</span><span class="sentence" id="595">I says to him, no, I don’t dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">So he detected a -- an accent and he looked at me again and he wondered why I been standing there alone and I’m not dancing, what are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="597">So he says, look, would you like to have a drink? </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I says, no, I don’t drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I was -- I was thinking, you know, I’m waiting for the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I don’t want to -- you know, start in with anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">So this girl that he came with had to say goodbye because she had to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">In the meantime, this -- this young man is not leaving, a-a-and so he says to me, like he -- he -- then he got like, would you like to -- would you like a Coke?

</span><span class="sentence" id="641">Well, I did -- he did tell -- say that he’s gonna come back, but I just wasn’t paying any attention, my mind was so preoccupied with other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">So he came back and he wants to go upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I says look, I’m in the middle of washing the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I-It’s very busy there, my sister is busy with the kids, I don’t February 21, 2001 think you can come upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">So he says, I'll tell you what, [Il wait in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> until you finish washing the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">So he comes up and he stays in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> and my sister says, who 1s he?

<p><span class="sentence" id="1217">ANSWER:  I think working in the Holocaust is giving me a chance to take my mother’s message to people, and so that makes me feel good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">And I don’t know, I just -- I think I -- I enjoy working there, don’t ask me why, but I -- I enjoy working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">I talk to people, different people, and I like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">Some people have questions and I February 21, 2001 don’t blame them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">If I probably wouldn’t live through what I did, I probably would have lots of questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">So I try to explain it the best way I know how that makes sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">And as you know, the Germans were very, very suf -- e-efficient, by keeping- by keeping track on where the Jews were going and what happened and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">So if they doubting my words, they can always go and pick up with some documents that were -- that we have today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">We don’t have it all because it wasn’t just <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> that they were killing people in the Einsatzgruppen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">And --

<p><span class="sentence" id="1234">ANSWER:  I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">I'll tell you the truth, being that I was lucky enough to bring 1n thr- three kids 1-into this world and given the chance to mold them, I think we can have February 21, 2001 a better society, because I know exactly how my kids feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">I remember going to work in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and kids would be -- you know, near their <span class="DLF">picket fences</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">You know, kids 10 - 11 years old, something like that, playing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">And when they saw us pass by, they started spitting and screaming [speaks German here]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">You see now, when kids are being brought up with this hate, I don’t really think they’re capable of loving other people, even though at that time they were hating the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">But I think when you bring up kids hating, they eventually hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">Their life will be a hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">It’s very destructive, very destructive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">Very destructive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">So now I -- I really feel if my kids would be different people, I -- I -- I would say well, you know, there’s nothing we can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">I understand -- I understand, being that my daughter is -- you know, she’s got a degree in microbiology that she -- she tells me a lot of people are, you know, born with certain genes, and I understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">I understand that, but you still have to nurture that gene. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">And he -- he might -- he might have the gene of having red hair or black hair or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">But the nurturing to make a person, I think it -- it -- it’s a big job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">To tell you the truth, I think if I would have known all that, maybe I would be afraid that I’m not capable of doing it, at that time, anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">But -- so I -- I definitely feel that if we can just somehow erase this hate, we will definitely have a better society, I do believe in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">I do believe in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">February 21, 2001

<p><span class="sentence" id="1260">QUESTION:  Do you belong to -- outside the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , do you belong to any survivor groups?</span></p>
