<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION: Let me begin, oh, by the way, this is Monday, January 12th, 1997.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER: Can't be the 12th.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION: Pardon me? </span><span class="sentence" id="3">January 6th, you’re right, do you by any chance wear a hearing aid?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER: No, I don't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION: You don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I'm in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Georgetown</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of Seymour Rubin and I'd like to begin. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">If you could give me some biographical information about yourself: when were you born and where were you raised and perhaps a little bit about your family and education before you went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  Well, I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , <span class="REGION">Illinois</span> , in 1914, April 6th, 1914, that makes me 82 years of age, as the newspapers have indicated the other day, much to my wife's annoyance. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I was raised in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , more or less, and I went to <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION: Telephone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER: Where are we now”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION: Your wife was annoyed that they put your age in the paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER: Well, you want to start off again about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION: Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER: I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> in 1914. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">My parents both came here from <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> at the age of two and three many, many years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> in <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> : <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  Which part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER: I was born on the West side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> and my family gradually moved to the <span class="REGION">North side</span> so that by the time I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , we were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilmette</span> , just North of the city of Chicago. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Michigan</span> , which 1s a nice <span class="BUILDING">state school</span> , it had a regular reputation and was just a sufficient distance away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> so I could get away from the family a little bit, but I could also get back -- by hitchhiking -- back, and get a meal when I needed one. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And then I went on from <span class="BUILDING">University of Michigan</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Law School</span> where I got my regular degree, Magna Cum Laude, and then I stayed on for an additional year and got an L.L.M. at the suggestion of Felix Frankfurter(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I thereafter went down to the Circuit Court of Appeals in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and clerked for the person I consider to be one of the better judges, one of the best judges, really, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , Augustus N. Hand, not Learned Hand who was his cousin who was on the same <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , but Gus Hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I stayed with him for a year and then came down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , the thesis was -- my thesis was -- that I was going to get a job, which I did get with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Reorganization Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">The reason for the Reorganization Division being that it was the factor in the SEC which handled litigated cases, corporate reorganization cases, and I wanted to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> and practice law with my two older brothers in the field of corporate reorganization, which had been occupying a great deal of their time. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I never got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> because I left the SEC [phone rings] should I stop?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION: Back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> ...
ANSWER: Well, I never got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> because I moved from the SEC to one of the wartime agencies, the office of Price Administration here which seemed a little more exciting at the time as we were just beginning to get into the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And then from the office of Price Administration, more by chance than anything else, I moved over to the State Department in March of 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION: Before we go to the State Department, could I ask you about your, is your family Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER: My family is Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I was raised in the Reform aspect of the Jewish religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I took Hebrew lessons which, unfortunately, I've completely forgotten about, and, I'm a reasonably non- conforming Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION: And during the early days of National Socialism, you were in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Were you actively aware of what was happening, and was it something that was a major part of your view of the world at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER: Well, I wasn’t tremendously aware of what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I was... I read the newspapers all the time and so I knew approximately what was going on, as much as one can gain from the newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I still remember being in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> when Mr. Hitler came to power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and I remember talking about that with a history professor who curiously, whose name I curiously enough still remember, Mr. Slossun(ph), his name was. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">A very distinguished professor, a very interesting professor. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">He said, "Hitler will last a few months, that’s all." </span><span class="sentence" id="42">That was in 1933, when I was still in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , and I was aware of what was going on quite clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">When I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Law School</span> which was in 1935, I saw a lot of people there and, as a matter of fact, I've, a group of other people and I got together and organized - with a fellow named Nathan Isaacs(ph), who is a professor at the <span class="BUILDING">business school</span> -- he came over to my little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that I was sharing with a couple of other characters, and sort of gave us lessons in the Talmud, supposedly every Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">It lasted about three Saturdays and that was about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">But, so far as what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was concerned, yes I was aware of it but I wasn’t deeply involved in anything particular. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I do remember being at a Harvard Law Review dinner one time and talking with one of the professors who was resentful about the fact that longshoremen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> had been trying to prevent the unloading of goods from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and he thought this was an unwarranted interference by a private organization in the affairs of the United States Government. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I disagreed rather strongly with him at the time but didn't take a tremendous amount of act, I did not take an active role, really, in anything going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I had a little bit to do, not very much, with refugee matters. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Partially because one of the people who eventually became my partner, and who was a year or two after me in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> , was very much involved in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And I probably contributed a little bit to some organizations but I didn’t do very much more than that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION: You mentioned that it was sort of by chance that you went to the State Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Can you describe a little bit more about that chance?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER: Yes, I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">As I said, I've spent a large amount of time in the Reorganization Division of the Securities and Exchange Commission when I first came down here to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And eventually in 1943, in early '43, a friend of mine, Bernard Melser(ph), who's still a Professor of Law, Emeritus, at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span> , called me. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">He was temporarily in the State Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">He was a very bright young man and he was about to go over to Europe, I think he was in on the Nuremberg Trials, but he was in the State Department at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And he called me, and he said there was a very interesting thing going on there, and why didn't I come over to the State Department and organize or work on something called the Reorganization Program in the Foreign Funds Control Division of the Department of State. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And I said, "Bernie, that has absolutely nothing to do with corporate reorganization under Chapter 10 of the <span class="BUILDING">Bank</span> ," -- well, Chapter 10 didn't exist, but 77B did -- "under the Bankruptcy Act at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">It's absolutely different." </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And he said, "Well, you know that and I know that, but nobody else knows that and you're the only person around who knows something about quote, 'reorganization.' </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Reorganization is reorganization is reorganization." </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So, I thought it was a very interesting kind of thing, and went over to the State Department, and basically I was the fellow who was in charge of the program, which there was one, and trying to run the Germans out of enterprises, primarily in <span class="REGION">Latin America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">The reorganization program there was one which took into account the fact that a large number of business enterprises in <span class="REGION">Latin America</span> , in particular, had been founded by German enterprises, Farben! </span><span class="sentence" id="65">and a variety of others. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And the worry was that these enterprises would contribute to the Nazi war effort in at least two ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">One was by contributing of funds to a variety of very evil causes; and the other was by contributing and financing espionage, or sabotage, or ' IG Farben: A large German Chemical Cartel. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Assets of this Cartel were cloaked by a Swiss holding company called "Interhandel" after the war. (</span><span class="sentence" id="69">Source: Nicholas Faith, Safety in Numbers: The Mysterious World of Swiss Banking. </span><span class="sentence" id="70"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> : Viking, 1982.) </span><span class="sentence" id="71">worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And the idea was, you had to allow the Latin Americans to continue to have the benefits of these organizations, many of which were in the medical and drug, pharmaceutical field. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">You couldn’t just close down the organizations, so you had to continue to have the organizations do what they had been doing: producing drugs. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">But you wanted to get the German influence out of those, and that was the reorganization aspect: trying to introduce, primarily at that time, American enterprise to come in and take over these enterprises. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Certainly during the period of the war, and probably thereafter, because we always had the theory that we didn’t want the Germans to come back again in <span class="REGION">Latin America</span> , particularly in view of the fact that the National Socialist philosophy was one that was anathema to most of us here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION: Was that reorganization separate from the Safe Haven Program? </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Or was that part of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER: The Safe Haven Program developed out of the Reorganization thing, that's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I was one of the originators of this, so called, Safe Haven Program. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">But that had the same kind of objective at it that the Reorganization Program did. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Reorganization was supposed to: a) take care of the present threat — try to get the German control away from these enterprises in <span class="REGION">Latin American</span> so they couldn’t contribute money; and secondly, the idea was to prevent any recurrence of the German influence in <span class="REGION">Latin America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">That, basically, was the Safe Haven Program, prevention of recurrence of Nazism, and fascism, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION: But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Safe Haven</span> was an international effort, not just an American effort, is that, can you describe more about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Safe Haven</span> and its beginnings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER: Well, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Safe Haven</span> was basically, my recollection is, it was basically an American initiative but we certainly had the British involved in it from the very beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And it may have been international in the broader sense of the word, because I’m sure, as what resulted, as a fact of the later days, the French got involved very heavily. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">But basically, at the beginning, the British and the Americans were the only ones who were able to do anything and it was a British-American effort, basically aimed at trying to identify German influence which one could equate with Nazi influence at the time, and to try to get rid of that, not only at the present time, but for, to prevent any recurrence of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">That was basically the Safe Haven Program. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">What we were trying to do is locate <span class="REGION">areas</span> where the Germans had located money, where Germans were cloaking or having somebody else cloak for them etcetera, etcetera.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION: And, specifically, what did you, what was your role in that effort?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER: Well, I was trying to devise policies with respect, particularly in the beginning, with the Latin Americans to try to persuade the Latin Americans, for example, to control the German enterprises, German owned enterprises in their <span class="REGION">territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">But, my first trip was down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> and my effort down there was to try to persuade the Columbian government to either supervise or actually vest the assets belonging to German controlled enterprises and then to have those administered in accordance with this reorganization program by Allies, by Americans, probably, because the Americans were the only ones really able to do this kind of thing but we would have said the British or the Dutch or anybody else, if there were people like that around as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">But there weren’t very many around.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION: So it was actually an effort to try and move American management in to take control of the corporation, 1s that...
ANSWER: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION: ...what you were doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER: Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Because the idea was, you were, as I say, had two objectives. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">One was a wartime objective, to prevent espionage and sabotage and financing of the German war effort and the second was a post-war effort which was akin with the idea, part of the idea that you didn't want the German, Germans as they were then certainly, to come back in to any kind of political power in other areas of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">We had some problems here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , as you probably know, with... we also had a lot of problems with the possibility of Germans infiltrating into the enterprises, particularly into the enterprises where they had been prominent in <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Bolivia</span> , Columbia, <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> , etcetera, in <span class="REGION">Latin America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">That was the part of the world that I was very much involved with. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">The entire enterprise had some people from, for example, one of my good friends, Kovi(ph) Oliver, who 1s still around, a very distinguished, now former, ambassador of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Colombia</span> many years after this, was stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">A good many of the people who were involved in this when I got into it, were Americans who spoke good Spanish because <span class="REGION">Latin America</span> was one of the areas of our concentration. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">We would find a lot of the people involved in this were people who had been born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">El Paso</span> , as Kovi(ph) was, or in some <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="REGION">Texas</span> who spoke Spanish as well as they did English, or nearly as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Kovi probably spoke it better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION: And that was 1943 when you went to the State Department...
ANSWER: 1943 was when I came into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">The effort had been going on for awhile before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I came into this Division of Foreign Funds Control, which was basically trying to look at the financial transactions of people who might be supporting the Axis, and what we were trying to do was to prevent any financial transactions which would have been of benefit to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">There were a variety of aspects of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">One was to blacklist companies, either in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or elsewhere, primarily elsewhere, because we had direct control over the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But we were trying to blacklist companies, mainly from the neutral countries who were doing business with the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION: Can you mention what some of those <span class="BUILDING">companies</span> are, were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER: They were, we were, we had a blacklist which was maintained in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> , Columbia, <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , a variety of other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Basically, wherever we thought, what we could do would be to prevent a financial transaction which would have been beneficial to the... to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">We were active in trying to say-- to the enterprises, mainly, or to individuals, but mainly these would be enterprises, individuals acting as enterprises, as well-- we were trying to say to them, "If you do this, you're not going to have any access, whatsoever, to any American facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And we will not only prevent you now from dealing with the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , selling to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or getting exports from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but we will continue this effort after the war in order to prevent you from rebuilding the thing."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION: Could you mention some of the enterprises that we’re dealing with, some of the German enterprises?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER: Well, the, Sterling Drug was one of the enterprises; IG Farben’, of course, is the largest one. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">There were a whole slew of corporations in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> which had been manufacturing ball bearings for other machine parts and things like that, who were all on the blacklist. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">My recollection does not go to the individual names very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">We had a few Americans on the blacklist, some American nationals living in <span class="REGION">Vichy France</span> ... <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> were suspected of dealing with the Germans, and we blacklisted American nationals. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">That raised some issues here but we did it nonetheless. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But, one of the real reasons for the negotiations with the Swiss in 1946 was the fact that the blacklist still existed and there were a number of Swiss corporations which were still on the blacklist and they were obviously desirous of getting them off the blacklist. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">We were desirous of restoring normal relations, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">But the principal motive for the negotiations on the <span class="REGION">Swiss side</span> , was to eliminate the blacklist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION: I want to lay as much groundwork for the Swiss negotiations as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So we're now at '43, '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">You have come to the State Department and you're sort of gradually becoming part of the Safe Haven Program, 1s this right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER: Yes, except not gradually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION: Not gradually. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">It didn’t happen gradually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER: No, it didn’t happen gradually. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I was there in the beginning and was very active in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Largely because I came to the State Department in 1943 as a very healthy young man with very, very bad eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And though I tried to get into the Navy, they threw me out, laughing all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And then the Army called me down for the draft twice and they examined me from stem to stern and found I was a very, very healthy specimen until they got to my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Then they couldn’t believe how bad they were and I got thrown out again. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So I was one of the 2 During the war, IG Farben had many holding companies, and/or branches all over the world, even in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="138">See Nicholas Faith, Safety in Numbers: The Mysterious World of Swiss Banking, pgs. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">144-160.) </span><span class="sentence" id="140">very few youngish males around here, at the time, who had had a fairly good education, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> and so forth, who was around at the time, who was not going into the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Most of the people my age were not married at the time (although I got married just at the same time that I went into the State Department), but if we were married, we didn’t have kids, etcetera, so most of my colleagues went into the Army or the Air Force or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And I happened to be around, so I moved up in that absolutely new <span class="REGION">area</span> for State Department work very, very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And basically, I was one of the originators of it, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION: In, I think 1t was Bower's(ph) book, about the, The Paper Clip Conspiracy, he quoted you as saying that you, one of the reasons you thought you moved up quickly in the State Department, because there some sort of renewed anti-Semitism backlash, because of senior State Department positions earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Can you sort of explain what that scene was like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER: I speculated with Mr. Bower(ph) a little bit about this, ’'ve never been quite sure about it, but I did move up. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">If you take a look at my record in the State Department, I moved up from the entry level to high in the Civil Services, I could go very, very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And there always was a rumor around that the State Department was rather anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I always thought that there were some people in the old Foreign Service who were, although I had many, many friends in the Foreign Service who had no anti-Semitism whatsoever, and I developed these friendships as time went along. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But it seemed to me, at the very beginning, that perhaps one reason that I was promoted as quickly as I was, was because I was what you might call a respectable Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I'd been to the <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Law School</span> , I’d been on the Harvard Law Review, I'd been a clerk for a very distinguished WASP?, </span><span class="sentence" id="152">a judge up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I knew which fork to pick up at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dinner table</span> , etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And I was reasonably respectable. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And it seemed to me that there was some possibility that when people looked around they said, well, here’s a fellow, we really want to do something about this anti-Nazi program, here’s a guy who happens to know a lot about it and who is very competent and > WASP: White Anglo-Saxon Protestant. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">who is respectable and, you know, he's the kind of person we would like to push forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So I did get to be the Chief of the Division 1n a very, very short period of time and, after that the Deputy Director of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and after that the first Assistant Legal Advisor for Economic Affairs, etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Whether this had much to do with my being Jewish or not Jewish, I really don't know except that I had a... I always had a sort of a little bit of a feeling that well, maybe, everybody thought well, this is a, quote, good Jew, unquote.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION: But the anti-Semitism, as you said, was not an issue for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">You didn’t experience it directly in the State Department.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER: No, I never experienced it directly in the State Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">The only experience I ever had with really discussing it in any, even remote way, was in connection with Mr. Bower’s book, The Paperclip Conspiracy, indicated that I was one of the people in the State Department who was most in favor of pursuing what had been Mr. Roosevelt's policy of keeping well-known, very active Nazis out of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , both then and probably forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And there was a program which was near and dear to the hearts of the United States Army people which was to bring German scientists, particularly rocket scientists, to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to help us in our rocket program. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">The Germans obviously had been well-advanced in the rocket program, way ahead of almost anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And it wasn’t Warner Von Brown(ph) and people like that, but they wanted to bring a lot more people in. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">That raised the question as to how many of these people you should bring into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , contrary to what had been the publicly stated policy, as I recall, of President Roosevelt, that, well, no Nazis, or active Nazis, were not going to get into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I was a little more, a lot more perhaps, ageressive in the saying, we ought to have very, very strict standards of necessity and utility, bringing these people into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> than the Army really wanted to adopt. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">As far as I could tell, back in those days, the Army officers, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> particularly, would go out and they would find somebody who'd swept the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> in the rocket establishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">They wanted to bring him to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> on the grounds that he would contribute to the... our own effort to develop rocket technology. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I had a little discussion about that, I wrote a memorandum about it, as a matter of fact, one time, and I got into a dispute, which is in... accounted in Mr. Bower's book, with a very good friend of mine named Clare Wilcox(ph), for whom I worked, as a matter of fact, a little bit later, in trade matters. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">He was a very distinguished economist from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swarthmore</span> and I'm sure he had not the slightest bit of anti- Semitism in him, not the slightest. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">But he thought that I was being a little too sensitive about the possibility that if you brought some of these Nazis into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> they would contribute to what was then, to a certain extent, the latent anti-Semitism of certain people in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I'd lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> when I was clerk for Gus Hand, and back in those days, there was a guy named Fritz Coon(ph) who was around, who was a well-known American Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">In any case, Wilcox and I got into a dispute which was reflected in a couple of memos back and forth in which Clare(ph) basically said he was just as anti-Nazi as I was but he didn’t think that this was the... it was appropriate, we were trying to keep too many people out of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> who would be useful, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And I had a little discussion by memorandum with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">The fact that it never really became personal was evidenced by the fact that sometime a little bit later, Clare Wilcox(ph) was the Deputy Chairman of our delegation to the International Trade Organization in 1947-48, and I was the legal advisor to that delegation. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I was one of Clare's(ph) principal assistants if you can call it that, at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And he and I became very, very good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">So I don't think that, well, that discussion took place largely, I think, because I had said that there were too many of these Nazis, or people who were likely to be Nazis, who were getting into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> under color of necessity and I really wanted to have a very strict standard applied. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I still remember, we sent somebody around to Vanovar Bush(ph) maybe we sent Vanovar Bush(ph) around to Mr. Conant(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I've forgotten which way it went. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">One of them was in the government... Tape #1, Side B
ANSWER: One of them was in the government and one of them was not, as I recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">To explore the question of how many of these scientists really would contribute to our rocket technology if they were brought into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And I do recall that, as we got back, was, well, you could bring a few of these people in, not too terribly many of them, and you could get everything you needed out of them in a period of about six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I'm not sure that that's entirely the case, because I suppose if somebody had developed something that really has been very good at one point, you can probably expect to get more things out of him as he went along, in the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">But, my recollection is that that was the reason for Mr. Bower's book, The Paperclip Conspiracy, basically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION: Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">The <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> took what's, I understand, has been described as a very tough roll against the neutral countries. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Can you describe the attitude, maybe even the position, of the State Department going into the Swiss negotiations in 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And I guess I need you to sort of lay the groundwork with the Paris Agreements the year before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">ANSWER: Well, I'll go back even before the Paris Agreement. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">The Pottsdam(ph) Agreement, signed, basically, the assets in the neutral countries of German nationals, to the Western Allies with respect to reparation purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So that the theory was that we would take, the... we'd get reparations from the Germans, and not only from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> itself, the <span class="REGION">occupied areas</span> , but also from the areas where Germans had interests in the <span class="REGION">neutral countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And the Paris Agreement decided on how those assets, how all of the reparations to be taken from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , would be divided up among all of the Western Allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Because the only people present, the only <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> present at the Pottsdam Agreement, were the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> , and the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> had to do something about allocating the proceeds, allocating the amounts that would be given to the various Allied countries, whether they happened to be <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , or the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">The Paris Agreement also worked out a formula -- because even then we were concerned about refugees and the people who were left homeless, the persecutees and so forth -- had worked out an agreement that a portion of what was recovered would be allocated to what was then the Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees, and through the Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees primarily it was decided -- I'm not sure if this was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> or a little bit later -- to the Jewish Agency* and the Joint Distribution Committee.</span><span class="sentence" id="198">° [phone ringing] The machine will pick that up, I hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">In any case, the Paris Agreement was one in which we were allocating the proceeds of the reparations which were scheduled to come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Now, part of those proceeds, obviously, were the assets of German, of the German entities, and German individuals located in the <span class="REGION">neutral countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And that laid the background for the negotiations with the Swiss and then later with the Swedes and the Spanish and the Portuguese and, even to a certain limited extent, with the Turks. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Because we knew there were a lot of German assets located in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> ; <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> had been right there at the center of Europe, it was a financial center and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And there was no question but that there were a lot of German assets in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So we began these negotiations on the thesis that what we were after, in accordance with the Paris Reparation Agreements, the United States, Great Britain and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , as agents of all the other Allies, were to secure these assets which were located in the neutral countries and put them into the reparations pot, which would be administered eventually by the Interallied Reparations Agency, which had been established and which was functioning in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">So, we began the negotiations with the Swiss, basically, on that thesis: That what we were doing was to look for the German assets in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and put them in the reparations pot. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">On the <span class="REGION">Swiss side</span> , the negotiations, as I said a moment ago, were useful, if you want to put it that way, because what they were aiming for was to get rid of the freezing and the blocking which was the result of the proclaimed list of certain blocked nationals, the formal name for the blacklist. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So that we had some incentive on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> to go ahead and negotiate. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">On the <span class="REGION">Allied side</span> , when we started the negotiations, before we actually got into the negotiations, we began to * Jewish Agency for Palestine was established in 1922 and recognized in Article 4 of the Palestine Mandate as a public body to advise and cooperate with the British administration of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in economic, social and other matters that affected the establishment of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish National Home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">> American Joint Jewish Distribution Committee (JDC) was founded as a philanthropic agency in 1914 to aid Jews in need all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">It played an active role in rescuing Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">think about this, and if we were thinking about taking over the German assets in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , we began to worry about what are, quote, the "German assets in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And at that point, maybe before, it was certainly on all of our minds, but articulating it, we began to say the formula, "The enemies...or our enemies... are our friends." </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And we were not going to take over the assets, even though they had originated from somebody 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , if they belonged to a persecutee. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">That is, the assets of Mr. Hans Schmidt, a good German Nazi, which were located in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , were different from the assets of Mr. Chaim Cohen, who had died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or in someplace like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Equally a citizen, formerly a citizen of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> who had deposited assets in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So, when we began the negotiations, we had basically these, the overall objective of securing the German assets in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and the subsidiary, but not very subsidiary, deviation from that objective, of exempting and making sure that the persecutees got whatever they possibly could get out of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">QUESTION: How did you go about determining what those figures were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">ANSWER: Well, in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we didn't determine what the figures were. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">The first thing we did, was to say in effect, "If there's a German asset, so-called German assets in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and you identify it, and Mr. Cohen who used to be living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , comes over there and says, "Hey, I was a persecutee, I survived Bergen-Belsen, here I am, I want my property back,’ you, the Swiss, nobody else, takes that asset and puts it into the reparation pot." -- </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Just as we, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , were returning the assets of persecutees who could turn up here and identify the assets. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Even though they were, quote, in quotes, "German assets." </span><span class="sentence" id="222">We demanded that the Swiss do exactly the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And as far as I know, there was never any objection to that on the part of the Swiss. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And as far as I know, every German Jew who turned up in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and could identify his assets, got those assets back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">QUESTION: Was that a significant number, do you have any idea how significant that number was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER: I have no idea how many assets there were, but I assume there were a number of people, particularly perhaps, more from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> than from the other <span class="REGION">occupied areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Because the Germans, in effect, had more notice. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I mean, Hitler was there in 1932, '33, and it was a long time before the controls really fell into place, before the Final Solution was begun to be worked on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And the German Jews were likely to be more prosperous than the Hungarian or the Rumanian Jews, although there were a lot of prosperous Rumanian and Hungarian Jews, maybe even Bulgarians, and Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So, the German Jews had some notice and, despite the fact that there were controls which were enacted by the Germans, I'm sure there was a considerable period of time when those controls could be successfully evaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So, I suspect, a large number of German Jews actually did get their money out of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> [sic]. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">One way or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Maybe before the war actually broke out, maybe even during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">The amounts, I have not the slightest idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Really. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I don't think we ever tried to make any evaluation of how many German Jewish assets there were in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , say, in 1932, at the beginning of the war before things really began to get terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And so, we had no way of knowing how much would have been recovered by German Jews who came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Whether the Swiss would have figures on somebody who turned up at the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> , and was able to identify the bank number, and was able to say, "I am the survivor," or, "I am actually the guy who put the money there and I want to get it back now." </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And how many of those people actually turned up and got their money out, that I just do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I don't know whether anybody knows it. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Maybe some people do, maybe if you went back and did this kind of study that Mr. Volcker is doing, maybe you could go back through all those old records and you could find that people did actually turn up and did recover their assets. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I'm sure that a large number of them did. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">That is not to say that a large number of them did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">But a large number of them did. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">As I say, I suspect in the case of the German Jews, it would have been more likely that they got the money out than the case of the Hungarians and the others who thought that, "Well, it's not going to come here," the Czechs or whatever, who thought, "We are going to be protected." </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I know there was a lot of people in, say, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , who had money in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and who came out and then went back into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , because they thought that nothing was going to happen to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">But, in most of those cases, they had their families out before they went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">We know a number of people would back and then, of course, they got caught.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">QUESTION: We're talking about individuals now. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">We're going into the negotiations, what about other assets in <span class="BUILDING">Swiss banks</span> , especially the question of gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">ANSWER: Well, the question of gold, there are two different questions there. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">If I can go back, the other assets you wanted to talk about, let me talk about the other assets. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">There were a lot of assets deposited in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> by German, Hungarian, etcetera, Jews, everybody was putting their money in, whether it was Jewish or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But the Jews had a particular reason and a lot of those assets were never claimed. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Because the people died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , not only they died, but all of their heirs and so forth died. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Now, on those assets, those I take it are what we are talking about here, so far as these negotiations are concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">There probably are still a substantial number of those around. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Because the Swiss never did what I and a variety of other people urged them to do at the end of the war, do the kind of census that Mr. Volcker and his group are doing at the present time. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">It's very difficult, I think, to get any clear figures down to the last penny or Swiss franc or whatever, as to how many of these assets there were, and maybe you could never really identify all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">But, because we discovered here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> when we tried to do a similar thing, it was very, very difficult to identify heirless assets. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Just by names and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">But, to a certain extent, a lot of those assets did exist in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they could have had a census. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Perhaps not as elaborate as the one which is being conducted now because it would have been timelier then. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Now, Mr. Volcker has to go back over all these years and check back records. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> have disappeared, and accounts have been transferred, etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Then, that was not the case; they could have done a census and, while I don't think they would have been able to identify every heirless asset, particularly since names are ambiguous, as we discovered here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">The name Burger might be Warren Burger(ph) of the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> , it might be my friend, Raul(ph) Burger, who is Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And this Warren Burger is not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Burger is a good German name, it Just means an inhabitant of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">ANSWER: None
QUESTION: At the end of those negotiations, can you remember how you felt about the conclusion that you had reached? </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Was it, did you feel at the time that it was... given the situation, that it was satisfactory, that you'd done what you could do? </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I mean, I know this is 20/20, we all have 20/20 hindsight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER: Forty years later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION: No, I mean, 20/20 hindsight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER: Oh, 20/20 hindsight, oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION: Yeah, it's 40 years later, but can you recall what you were thinking at the time when those negotiations finished?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">ANSWER: Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I remember very, very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I was not very happy with the conclusion of the negotiations, particularly on this question of heirless assets. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We thought we had achieved pretty much what we were able to achieve and what we could achieve in connection with the general reclaiming of German assets for the reparations pot. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Even there, there were problems, because, basically what we did, in the end, was to say to the Swiss, "Okay, you're, you will identify all the German assets. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Now, I'm talking about German assets, excluding the Jewish °"The American Jewish Committee was founded in 1906 as a Jewish defense organization in reaction to anti-Jewish pogroms in Tzarist Russia. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">During Nazi era: Urged the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to intervene on behalf of the persecuted Jews of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Post-war: Concerned with restitution, resettlement, reparations, indemnification, and immigration to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ."

QUESTION: They were afraid of alienating the Swiss? </span><span class="sentence" id="307">What was, can you... I know you were very much involved in discussions with the British. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Can you go into more detail about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER: The British wanted to re-establish normal relations with the Swiss. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">The Swiss had been a neutral country. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">The British lawyers had, perhaps, the same attitude that a lot of American international lawyers had, except that that seemed to me to be a little stronger in the <span class="BUILDING">Foreign Office</span> there than it was in the State Department here, maybe because I and a couple of other people like myself were in the State Department, but, basically, the attitude was that the neutrals had a perfectly good nght to deal with whoever they were going to deal with. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">That, basically, is the essence of neutrality. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And to a certain extent, that is a policy which had been established by the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> way back in the 1800's when we enacted the Neutrality Act. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">We were able to deal with the French when the British thought we shouldn't be dealing with the French in the French-British wars. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">But, in any case, we were very strong on this subject of not dealing with the Germans and, basically, we had no particular strength in retaining the proclaimed list. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">So we came to the conclusion that we might as well, the best thing we could do would be to conclude the agreements on the basis we did, which gave us the money we * <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Capitol Hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">wanted, pretty much, so far as German assets, strictly German assets were concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Which gave us a statement that they would look sympathetically at the whole business of heirless assets. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And we thought we could probably work out something on that and we would be able to get them to do a census so that we would be able to find out what the heirless assets were, and so that we could take those assets and turn them over to the Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And that's where we were when we came to a conclusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Satisfactory? </span><span class="sentence" id="322">No, this interview which was done with me in the Post, I thought it was a pretty good and fair story, a lot of my friends have told me that I shouldn't be too unhappy because I expressed a view that maybe we could have done better. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Well, I've never been in a negotiation, almost never been in a negotiation, where I thought I had done the absolute best that I possibly could at the beginning of negotiation. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And I am not now, and was not then, unhappy with what we came out with. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I thought it was a reasonably satisfactory conclusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">But, not completely satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">QUESTION: Let's talk also about the issue of gold which we skipped over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER: Okay, looted gold, I'll get back to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">There, you have to make a distinction with respect to the question of looted gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">The main body of looted gold that we were talking about back in those days when we started negotiating with the Swiss and with the others, the Portuguese as well, was the gold which was stolen by the Germans out of the Central Bank depositories. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">You have to know that the large amount of gold that was on deposit in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , was moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and maybe down to Dakar(ph) and re-smelted and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">But that was Belgian government Central Bank gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And what we were then making sure of, trying to make sure of basically, was that the gold which was stolen by the Germans out of every <span class="BUILDING">Central Bank depository</span> , which was basically where gold was kept, was restituted at the end and that's the gold which we have, basically, gotten back. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">To the extent of about 60 or 70 or maybe even 80 percent of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">That is the gold which, basically, has been distributed by the International Gold Commission, a tripartite commission on gold, which is more or less affiliated with the <span class="BUILDING">institutions</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , and which as been restored, a part of which has been restored even fairly recently, to the Albanians, who lost gold from their central depositories and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">That is one aspect. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">That's the major part of the, quote, the "looted gold" that went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and which was used by the Germans for their own purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">The second part of the looted gold, was the gold which was taken out of the teeth of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> victims, the gold bracelets that came off the wrists of women, etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And in that particular category of quote, "looted gold," unquote, we generally included looted gold and other assets because, in that same general category, we're talking about paintings, valuable silverware, etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">All the valuables, the personal valuables that people would have. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Now, a certain amount of that, going back strictly to the gold, was looted by the gold... looted by the Germans, and melted down by them, and used by them for their own wartime purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I hesitate a little bit when I say "wartime purposes," because I am reasonably convinced without having any particular proof of it, that a substantial amount of that went into the pockets of the individuals, the individual Germans who were there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , the guards, etcetera, etcetera, the people who had control of it, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">The Germans were pretty good at keeping track of things like this because they didn't want the guards to be profiting instead of the authorities back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , but I'm sure that, since in almost every other case there's been some individual looting, there probably would have been a considerable amount of individual looting in this particular case. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So, some of that, though, may have disappeared into the pockets of the guards, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">But a large amount of that gold went back to <span class="BUILDING">smelting establishments</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and was smelted down. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And then, probably, having been smelted, had the Reichsbank stamps put on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And, all in all, probability, the Reichsbank stamps dated back five or ten years or something like that so that it looked just like gold that had been in the Reichsbank Central Bank depositories for years. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Now, the Swiss knew at the beginning of the war, approximately how much gold reserves the German central bank did have. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And they know that during the course of the war, more gold went through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> than was in those depositories at the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">So, everybody there, I think, has been conscious of the fact that a large part of that gold had to be looted in one sense or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">In the sense of having come from the central bank depositories of the, what should have been Belgian gold, or Albanian gold, or French gold or something like that, Central Bank gold, and on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , gold that came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> or out of just stealing the stuff from the Jews who had not been put into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but whose <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were looted. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">So, that gold has been a substantial part of the discussion. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">The question of what actually happened with respect to the gold that passed through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , or came into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , is, I think, one that maybe Mr. Volcker’ and others will be able to find out more clearly about. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">A large part of that gold, I think, was just transferred back, transferred by the Germans, converted into Swiss francs, and the Swiss francs were used by the Germans to purchase whatever it was they wanted to purchase, war materials in the first place, or something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Some of that gold probably remained in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">How much remained in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I don't, I doubt that very much of it did remain in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , because I think it had all been used, to the extent that it possibly could be used. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">We did work out an agreement with the Swiss in which they would make a payment on account of looted gold to the International, the Tripartite Gold Commission. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And a payment of that sort was made. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Beyond that, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">How much of this gold can be identified as having come from the people who were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and how much their claims, therefore, should be, I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I notice in the newspapers, there was some complaint about the fact that the amount of money that's still in the Federal Reserve in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , under the control of the Tripartite Gold Commission, some payments were being made to governments, like the Albanian government, rather than to individuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Since the governments got back less than, a lot less than 100% of what was looted from them, I'm not sure that that's a legitimate complaint. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">I think the governments are entitled to get their gold back. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">How much of the gold that came out of teeth, etcetera, etcetera, actually went into ? </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Paul Volcker. </span><span class="sentence" id="367"><span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , one does not really know. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">It may be, as people now tell me, nobody told me at the time, that one could identify the gold that came out of bracelets and teeth and so forth, as having had that kind of origin. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Because that gold has in it, elements which are not found in the gold which comes out of a <span class="DLF">mine</span> , which is then smelted and cast into a monetary bar. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">But, on this, I really have very little knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">QUESTION: Could you talk about the negotiations themselves? </span><span class="sentence" id="372">You mentioned to me when we spoke last week, the names of some of the Swiss negotiating team, the tenor of the meetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">It went on, the meetings went on for two months, I guess.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="383">ANSWER: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">QUESTION: Can you talk about some of those sort of aspects of the, of the talks?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">ANSWER: Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Well, the, the, the Swiss negotiations were, as I said, the first negotiations we went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Later was the Swedish negotiations here in, in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , there was a substantial contrast, in the tone, really, of the two. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">But to talk about the Swiss, the Swiss delegation was headed by Walter Stucki, who was a very eminent Swiss ambassador. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I’ve forgotten what other posts he held but he was a pretty high dignitary’® so far as the Swiss government was '© Walter Stucki was a senior official at the Swiss Political Department. (</span><span class="sentence" id="390">See Nicholas Faith, Safety in Numbers: The Mysterious World of Swiss Banking, pg. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">140.) </span><span class="sentence" id="392">concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I think he had been the Swiss ambassador to <span class="REGION">Vichy France</span> , as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And he headed the delegation. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">He was a tall, stern, balding fellow and rather severe in appearance, I would say, and a little remote 1n tone, in tone and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">The second man on the Swiss delegation, as far as I can recall, was a fellow named Rappard, who was a very pleasant, genial, very distinguished Swiss international lawyer whose name is commemorated in the <span class="BUILDING">Rappard Institute</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> at the present time which is one of the world’s leading institutions in the field of the study of international law. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And he was one of the people with whom I dealt most extensively because I have a legal background and he was a lawyer and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Other members to the delegation I don’t remember too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">There apparently was a fellow named Heerch(ph) or Hersh(ph) or something like that, whom I must say I can’t recall at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">There was another member, the junior member of the delegation, named Geeterom(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Gee, his last name was Durham, D-U-R-H-A-M, who I think is no longer in existence but may be, and my recollection is that there was another fellow who was also around in the background, sort of, named Paul Jolles, J-O-L-L-E-S, who I think 1n later years was a rather distinguished Swiss government official in the field of international trade, which is the <span class="DLF">field</span> that I followed in years later, myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">The member of the Swiss delegation, I think, was a fellow named Ernst Shtayburger(ph), who was here in the Swiss legation at the time and who became a very good friend of mine in years thereafter. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Wrote some pieces when he was in private life in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> about the fact that there had been a lot of cloaking in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And...
QUESTION: Cloaking is?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">ANSWER: Cloaking in the sense of Swiss using their names to disguise the fact that a particular asset was really a German asset. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">For example, the biggest case, which was one, one that causes a lot of difficulty and which you find a lot about in the records of the Justice Department here and so forth, was the IG Chemie case. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">IG Chemie was a Swiss corporation. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">It was accused by us and by others of being a cloak for I.G. Farben. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And the holdings in the United States of IG Chemie included General Dyestuff(ph) Corporation which was a very large aspect that closely connected with General Aniline and Film, which again, was a very large company which rivaled Kodak at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">But General Aniline Film and General Dyestuff were American corporations, presumably owned by IG Chemie. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Our, our, our argument was that IG Chemie was really a cloak for IG Farben. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And that's what I mean by cloaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">There were many cases, much less dramatic than that, much smaller than that, in which an asset owned by Mr., we’ll say, Mr. Hans Schmidt, use that name I always use, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> was held in the name of Mr. John Jones, or whatever his name could have been, well, it was cloaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And that was the case, of course also, in, in a number of situations in <span class="REGION">Latin America</span> , where companies were...perfectly non-German companies were accused of being cloaks for the German, real owners, of the property.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">QUESTION: And Durham had written, you said, written extensively about this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">ANSWER: No, Durham, Durham had never written, as far as I know, anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">He was a junior member of the, William Rappard(ph), I'm not sure how much he had written about the subject, I wrote a lot more than he did on there...and a fellow named Borchard(ph) here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , who was a professor of law at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , had written quite a bit about the subject, the general subject of whether it was possible to take enemy private assets and use them for reparations purposes, basically, that was the issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">But Rappard was the, the eminent international lawyer on the, on the Swiss delegation, so that when we were talking about heirless assets and the utilization of German assets in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , private German assets in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , for, for reparations purposes, for payment of the reparation claims of the Allies, it would be Rappard who would talk about the general rules of international law which protected the enemy private assets, and I keep emphasizing private, in the neutral countries, or indeed, in hostile <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Because Borchard here and Paul, I think his first name was Paul, maybe not, but Professor Borchard at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> wrote articles which are on file now which said that, under the rules of international law, the assets of enemy private individuals were, in effect, sacrosanct and could not be confiscated, even by their enemies. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">That is, the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> would be allowed, under his theory, to take over the assets in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> belonging to the German government or maybe to semi-governmental corporations, if there were such. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">But if there was a private individual in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , who had a bank account in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , that bank account could not be taken by the United States government and used for reparation payments or war claim payments in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Because under international law, it was a private asset of an enemy national. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">That is one of the big arguments which you can find...my articles on that subject and Professor Borchard's(ph) article on the subject and the article...sort of takes a position closer to Borchard(ph), but somewhat intermediate, written by a fellow named Otto(ph) Summerick(ph)...Otto Summerick was a lawyer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> of German background, but those three articles are in a publication put out by the Duke University Law School entitled, "Law and Contemporary Problems," and I think it's the issue, maybe the summer of 1952, something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">QUESTION: What about the American delegation, aside from yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Can you talk about who else was there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">ANSWER: Well, the American delegation for the negotiation of the Swiss was headed by Randolph Paul. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Randolph Paul was a very, very distinguished, had been a very distinguished tax lawyer, he had been the general counsel of the Treasury Department during a good part of the war years. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And he was one of the people who participated in the formulation of the negotiations with the Swiss and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">He headed the United States delegation. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">I was his deputy. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I was in the State Department, and...I'm not sure whether it was then still called the Foreign Funds Control Division or whether it was called the, let's see, one moment while I think about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I think it was the Division of Enemy Property Controls. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Enemy Property Controls, I think, was the name of the division. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">But, there was a transition in the State Department from Foreign Funds Control to Enemy Property Controls and I moved from being in the Foreign Funds Control Division to being the chief of the Division of Enemy Property Controls and then we expanded that division and took charge of, basically, of post-war negotiations on enemy property matters in both, on both sides of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I became the Deputy Director of the Division...of the Office of Enemy Economic Warfare, Economic Controls. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">In any case, I was on the delegation as Mr. Paul's deputy. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">On the delegation was a fellow named Orvis Schmidt who was, you would have to get his title from somebody else, but he was in the, basically, the Office of Foreign Funds Control of the Treasury Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And I’m not sure whether he was actually on the delegation or not, but there was a fellow who took an active part of 1t named John Pailey(ph), who was Mr. Schmidt's boss in the Treasury Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">There were a couple of other people who were very actively engaged in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And I really can't remember how many people were actually on the, on the delegation. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I think my deputy, Walter Surrey(ph), was actually on the delegation. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And in the Treasury Department, probably, a fellow named Joe Duboy(ph), Doobwah(ph), Dooboise(ph), D-U-B-O-I-S, was, was on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And a...very actively on the delegation was a fellow named James Mann(ph), who was later in the American legation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berne</span> as a Treasury Department representative in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berne</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and he was very active in all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">He and Orvis Schmidt were probably the ones who dealt the most with the issues of looted gold because that was an issue which seemed peculiarly to fall in the hands of the Treasury Department rather than the State Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And that pretty much made up the American, American delegation. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Randolph Paul was the head of the delegation and very active.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">QUESTION: Is it true, as far as you know, that you're the only person of that delegation that survives?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">ANSWER: I was the only person what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">QUESTION: You're the only person surviving?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER: I am the, I am the only one of the negotiators in these negotiations who is surviving in the sense that I was the head of the negotiation in all, all four of these negotiations and so far as the Swiss, so far as the Swiss, French, British and so forth, I'm the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Randolph Paul is dead, so I'm the...the other people on the American delegation and the Swiss thing, well, Jim Mann is dead, Randolph, well Randolph is dead, Walter Surrey is dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I can't think of anybody else on the delegation who has survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">There is one other person who is alive who knows a good deal, deal about this and that is Morton Bock(ph), whose name I may have mentioned before, who's living up here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , not far away from where I am now, who's still a good friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">He's ten years older than I am, so, it gives me hope that I'll be able to go on for a little while longer anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And he was around in, probably in the Treasury Department, at the time of these negotiations. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I have a difficulty remembering whether Mort was actually in the Treasury Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I guess he was in the Treasury Department, maybe during the negotiations. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">He may have actually gone over to the American Legation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berne</span> at the time, but he probably would have come back for the negotiations if he had been over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">But I, I, I know about Mort very well, but I can't remember really whether he sat in on these negotiations or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">QUESTION: And something about the tone of the negotiations. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">You mentioned that Mr. Stucki was very stern and somewhat distant person, but did that set the tone for the negotiations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">ANSWER: Yes, it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">The negotiations were not very, not very friendly except for the fact that I became very friendly with a few of the people afterward, like Shtayburger(ph), who was a wonderful guy and who was not as stern as that. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">But Stucki was a rather stiff, you might call middle European bureaucrat, diplomat. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And he took very strongly the, the, the <span class="DLF">Swiss line</span> that there was no entitlement on the part of the Allies to any of these German assets in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , let alone the heirless assets. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And, that was the <span class="DLF">line</span> which he took very, very strongly. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I might deviate a little bit here to say that, that same <span class="DLF">line</span> , basically, was taken by a very different person whose name was Emil Sandstrom, who was head of the Swedish delegation. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Sandstrom had been a justice of the Supreme Court of Sweden, he was the head of the League of Red Cross Societies,'! </span><span class="sentence" id="469">he was a wonderful, wonderful, man. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And he, as a lawyer and as a Swede, took the same <span class="DLF">line</span> , that the Allies were not entitled to the German private assets in, in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">But the Swedish attitude was, okay, fellas, we don't think you're entitled to these things, but we think we should be making some kind of contribution, not 11 perhaps Mr, Rubin is referring to the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC). </span><span class="sentence" id="472">This was the umbrella organization of all of the regional Red Cross offices. (</span><span class="sentence" id="473">See Jacques Picard, <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and the Assets of the Missing Victims of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Bank Julius Baer: 1993.) </span><span class="sentence" id="475">only to, to the Allied reparations finances, but also to the refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">They had taken in a lot of refugees, of course, during the war and, basically, what we'll do, a calculation. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">How much you think you'll be entitled to and we'll make that available as a pro bono gift. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">So we give it to you as a gift, you take it as your due, whatever the theory, the money gets over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And then we don't have to argue about the law of the, the international law with respect to enemy private property, enemy private property. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So that, that, that the negotiations with the Swedes went swimmingly and very...on a very friendly basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">With the Swiss, they were stiff and Stucki, having said you're not entitled to anything, for quite awhile, went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> for further consultation, then he came back here and pretty much reiterated the same point. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And then I suppose I made, well, somebody’s described me as having made a moral argument, which may or may not have had some kind of effect, that not only are we entitled to this legally, but there’s a moral obligation on the part of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> because <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , well, they allegedly armed themselves to resist any aggression if it should come and did not bear any of the real costs of the war and all sorts of other people did. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And we arrived at the conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">QUESTION: Do you remember delivering that opinion in...
ANSWER: Oh, I remember saying it in one of the meetings, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I don't remember whether I put it in writing or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">QUESTION: Do you remember the response, do you remember...
ANSWER: Oh, the response was one of well, maybe, or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">It was not a very...1t was not yes, you've convinced us and here you are with the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">But in the end, they went back and they did come back with a proposal, as I say, which was not as satisfactory as I would have liked it to be, but it was better than saying get out of our hair, we’re not going to give you a nickel.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">QUESTION: How important do you think was your argument in turning them around?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">ANSWER: My moral argument?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">QUESTION: Honestly, I mean...
ANSWER: Honestly, I think it had some effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I think it had some effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">I think that it may have had some effect, more because they began to think a little bit about the public relations aspect than, than any other aspect of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">It may be, and I do not condemn Mr. Stucki as being a Nazi, I don’t think he was, he was a very stern, stiff Swiss diplomat. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">But I have sort of a feeling, and he was you know, sympathetic in the sense of what had been going on, but I suspect that basically, what he began to think about was the possibility that there not only was a plausible legal argument which they continued to deny, but I am convinced that my rhetoric was sufficiently good, my logic sufficiently good and my demonstration sufficiently good so that maybe I inculcated a few doubts even in the mind of people like Professor Borchard(ph) up at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And I think maybe I did the same thing with Mr. Stucki and maybe with...and certainly with Mr. Rappard(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="498">But then I think also, the moral argument appealed to them in a sense because maybe there was... it had some effect as a moral argument and more because it had an effect as an argument they thought about as a possibility of public relations. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">What's going to happen if the Allies really come forward with this and they say that on, on a moral basis, the Swiss have been bastards. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">That, I think, probably had some effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">How much effect, I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I ain’t no psychologist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">QUESTION: Yeah, but they also had a tremendous interest in furthering their position as an international center of finance in the future, so they...that's what you...
ANSWER: Oh yes, I'm sure, I'm sure that the fact that these arguments were being made on a moral basis, etcetera, had a, had a considerable effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">They're thinking about their future relations. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">The British, on their side, were thinking about being a little more lenient, I think, than the Americans were, partially because they wanted to re-establish financial relations with the Swiss, and I have no doubt that the Swiss wanted to re-establish financial relations with everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">That, of course, was one of the reasons why they were so insistent and so they were so anxious about getting rid of the proclaimed list, getting rid of the blacklist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION: And was the, the elimination of the blacklist a direct point of negotiation? </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Was, was that something that you all as members of that delegation had control over?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">ANSWER: Oh, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">That was central to the negotiations, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">The Swiss were saying, one of the things we have to have is the elimination of the blacklist. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And we were saying, you don’t get that until we get this agreement. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And then we said, as soon as you get the agreement...I think, I'm trying to think whether we said as soon as you get the agreement or as soon as the agreement is implemented, you get rid of the blacklist. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">To my shame, I really can’t remember which one we said. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I think probably we said something about implementation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">QUESTION: Because they had to go back and have, this...agreement had to be ratified by their <span class="BUILDING">parliament</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER: It had to be ratified by their <span class="BUILDING">Parliament</span> , that's right, that's nght. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And I remember, and this is in the comments which I made...the article I wrote about the Swedish agreement, I, I pointed out that the Swedish agreement was implemented very, very...almost immediately, if not immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">QUESTION: It was June when the <span class="BUILDING">parliament</span> agreed, but I gather that their discussions were extremely contentious in the Swiss Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">ANSWER: I'm sure that they were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">The Washington Post reporter, David Ottoway(ph), mentioned in his piece this fall about you, that, at the time of those agreements, there was very little attention paid to, to what was happening here. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">There were so many other things going in the news, that even the New York Times barely mentioned the fact that the, that an agreement had been reached. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">In retrospect, was that a...was it helpful to the negotiation or did that harm the negotiation in any way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">ANSWER: Well, I wouldn’t say it harmed the negotiation. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">It certainly didn’t help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I mean, it would have helpful, I think, had there been a little more publicity about what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">As, the point I made a little while ago, which was that one of the reasons why I think the Swiss came to the conclusion that they did at the very end, perhaps inadequate as that was, was that, the fear of publicity. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And publicity here would have, I think, pushed them a little bit further on. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">They had a very competent ambassador here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , Mr. Bruggemann, and my recollection is that we talked with him and he was very anxious to have this agreement concluded. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">I'm, I'm not...I don't recall very much that, that, that he took any part in the negotiations but I do have a very strong feeling that he was anxious to get this thing over with and he probably back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was pushing Mr. Stucki quite a bit, back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> here, the liaison. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">He was married, incidentally, to a lady who had been an American, who maybe still was an American, who was Henry Wallace's” sister, who was apparently, allegedly, the only non-native born Swiss who ever spoke Schweizerdeutsch(ph) perfectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">QUESTION: Do you, do you recall President Truman ever expressing any opinion about the course of these negotiations, directly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">ANSWER: I do not recall that we ever got to see Mr. Truman, that I...I don't recall any particular expression from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">I was reasonably sure that we had his support in the <span class="BUILDING">White House</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Back in those days, you sort of stuck around where you were. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">You didn't go through <span class="DLF">back channels</span> as much as they do at the present time and, and I didn't have any <span class="DLF">back channels</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">White House</span> anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Even Randolph, Randolph Paul, I, I, I doubt that he ever saw Mr. Truman about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">But, you know, the thesis was, when we began the negotiations, we knew what we wanted and we never had any lack of support. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Now if we'd, if we'd perhaps said to the <span class="BUILDING">White House</span> , why don't you go to see the, why don't you call in the ambassador’? </span><span class="sentence" id="541">and tell the ambassador in, here sitting in the <span class="BUILDING">Oval Office</span> , that if they don't do something, we're going to be in, they're going to be in very bad shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Maybe we should have done that, we never thought about doing it, as far as I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And I don't think that Randolph Paul ever thought about doing it either.

<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION: Let me just check and see how I'm doing here for time. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I'm 1n a position here where I don't know what I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">So I'm going to...I'm relying on you to help me fill in, you know, points that I should be asking or should ask differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I think I'd like to go, if we've, if we've covered this, to go on a little bit to your work in the Hague Agreements, just to mention it and what your role was. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">But...or do you think it's worth talking more about this Swedish and the Portuguese and what other negotiations were you involved in, in a general way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">ANSWER: Well, I might talk a little bit about the Swedish negotiations just because it, it does form a very big contrast to the Swiss. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And there's an article in, in one of the Swiss newspapers, the Swiss interviewed me a little while ago and there's an article which...have you seen that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">QUESTION: No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">ANSWER: ...which says, difficult Swiss, amiable Swedes, something like that, about the...
QUESTION: Okay, okay, should we do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Do you think that...
ANSWER: If you like, I don’t know whether this is relevant to this oral history or not, you know, I was very much involved in the negotiations with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> and, and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I think to a certain extent, but let me talk a little bit about the, the, the restitution process, the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization’* because that is very much involved here and people are saying that the Jews didn’t get what they should and... (Pause on tape)
QUESTION: Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Here we are back, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">ANSWER: I think what I would like to mention, briefly, I’ve only read two things, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">One is the question of the contrast between the Swiss and the Swedish negotiations. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">In both cases, we were looking for pretty much the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">We were looking for the German assets in the two <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , to take for reparation purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">We were looking for restitution of looted gold, if there were any looted gold there, and we were looking for some kind of claims with respect '4 Jewish Restitution Successor Organization (JRSO): Based in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , JRSO was organized by various Jewish philanthropic organizations to handle restitution issues. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">to the persecutees. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">In neither case, did we have any problem with respect to individual claims of people who had come in and identified their property. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">There never was any, any issue about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So far as the Swedes were concerned, they also made a contribution so far as the Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees'!? </span><span class="sentence" id="567">was concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">But so for the difference between the two negotiations, was that the Swiss were very, very sticky so far as the legal aspects were concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Maybe legitimately, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">There still are people who argue that enemy private property is, 1s sacrosanct and maybe not. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And they also were very difficult with respect to the one aspect, that I think is very important, the question of identification of, of heirless assets in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">In that particular case, it seems to me, they could very well at that particular point, have done basically what Paul Volcker is doing at the present time, with much less trouble than Mr. Volcker is having to go through: identify, if not 100 percent of the heirless assets, at least 95 percent or 85 percent or something like that, and restituted those to an, a successor organization like the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization which was operating very successfully back in those days, and right across the <span class="DLF">border</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">On the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization, I think it's important to note, in connection with the, the possible, their possible role in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , their possible role as a successful organization in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , that they did exactly that in the American Zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , very, very successfully. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">The JRSO did obtain a tremendous amount of, of property in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> which had been looted from Jews and so forth, and that was, was properly restituted, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">They also were able to participate in the negotiations with the Germans on, perhaps, the larger issue of the, of restitution of jobs, of taking care of people who had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and giving them some kind of compensation, inadequate, obviously, as monetary compensation ever would be for that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">They still were able to get people some 'S Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees (IGCR): "A body formed in 1938 to manage a solution to the problem of Jewish refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="577"><span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> was reluctant to involve itself with this body." (</span><span class="sentence" id="578">Source: Jacques Picard, <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and the Assets of the Missing Victims of the Nazis.) </span><span class="sentence" id="579">kind of compensation for the loss of career, the loss of jobs, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">So the JRSO could have been a very, very effective operating agency here. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">On the question of heirless assets, they could have, I think, helped a great deal, and I am not minimizing the difficulty of identification of heirless assets, even in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">We had the same problem here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">We had property in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> which was vested by the Alien Property Custodian, on the grounds that it had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And there was no way of telling whether that property coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had been the property of a Jew, who died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> or wherever, or had been the property of Mr. Goering,!</span><span class="sentence" id="585">° except by taking a look at the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">If you didn't have the names, basically all you knew, was that the account had been established by somebody in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and if the name was ambiguous and so forth, you didn't really know. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">We claim, we, the JSRO in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , claim that there should be about three million dollars on our best estimate, and that was an estimate made on the very, very crude business of taking a look at names and lists and things like that, in the assets which had been vested by the Alien Property Custodian and which were being turned over to the War Claims Commission here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to pay United States war claims. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Negotiations in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> resulted in our first coming down to a figure of three million dollars as the amount of money which we thought would be adequate for this particular vested, vested asset, amount of heirless assets. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Then that had to be reduced, because the War Claims Commission and others would refuse to accept it, to one million, and in the end, we had the Congress pass legislation which gave to the JRSO, only half a million dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Which indicates the difficulty of having, of identifying heirless assets even in a situation where you have the entire forces of the government trying to work with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">So, I think that perhaps the situation in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> is, in a sense, understandable. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">I'm not sure how much there will be located in the way of heirless assets, '© Reichs Air Minister and Economic Tzar: Responsible for huge amounts of looted art which he funneled into Nazi Germany's national collections as well as his own collections. (</span><span class="sentence" id="593">See Klaus Fischer, Nazi Germany, Continuum: New York 1995.) </span><span class="sentence" id="594">particularly in view of all of these other factors. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">But the assets should have been restituted to the, restored to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization back in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">It should have been made available in those days to the, either the Joint Distribution Committee or the Jewish Agency, and should have gone for purposes of relief which would have been much more relevant back then than, than they are at the present time. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I say it would have been more relevant back then than they are at the present time, because even though I'm conscious of the fact that there are a number of people who are still impoverished here 1n the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I can not really believe that... Tape #2, Side B
ANSWER: ...people who are still impoverished here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I can not really believe that these assets would be, if they went into this, this kind of account, very, very significant in terms of the total amounts that have been made available to the persecutees. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">The total amounts made available to persecutees come, basically, out of all sorts of sources, but I, I think, primarily, out of the sources that came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in connection with the Hague negotiations, which, at Vassanar(ph) in which I participated in 1952 and '53, where we negotiated on behalf of both the government of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> on the one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , as the two Jewish organizations, negotiated, negotiated there. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And then the government of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was represented on its own behalf and then, of course, the Germans, represented by, very largely by a, a first class gentleman named Boehm(ph), I can't remember his first name, B-O-E-H-M, who was a wonderful, wonderful guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And we did negotiate there, and there have been negotiations which have been going on ever since, and there has been a lot of money which has been paid into various accounts which, I think, has gone to recompense persecutees and their survivors, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I'm not saying, as I say, that the people who survived and the heirs and so forth, are not entitled. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">They're very much entitled to everything that they, they could possibly get. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Certainly, they're entitled, if they can establish claims, to the property which was left by one of their own ancestors. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And certainly, also, they're entitled to whatever amount may come into the pot which goes into a pot of heirless assets, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">But that amount that's going to go into the heirless asset pot is going to be minuscule compared to the amounts which have already gone in and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And that, I think, is probably true even with respect to looted gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">There may be some looted gold which should be recovered, which has come out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , but you have to remember, a large amount of that looted gold was recovered in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">It was recovered at the, at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I know that one of the officials of the International Refugee Organization!’ </span><span class="sentence" id="610">came to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> with a couple of jerry cans filled with bracelets and gold teeth and so forth, and brought them into the American legation in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and by arrangement with them, they were taken over to a, a cooperating Swiss bank and they were...those things were all smelted down and the proceeds were paid to the International Refugee Organization for the account of the, of the survivors and so, paid into the, into the interest of the...probably through the Jewish Agency and the JDC, but they went for the purposes about...but most of that stuff was probably recovered in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">A large amount of it must have disappeared, as I say, a large part of 1t was confiscated, a large part probably confiscated by guards at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> and a certain amount of it, certainly, went into the smelting pots and was eventually stamped and came out again as the, with the Reichsbank stamp on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">So there may be some additional amount available there. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">How much is a, is a matter which I think will be very difficult to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">One other thing about the Swiss, and the claim against <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , most of the money, I think, probably went...a lot of the money at any rate, went through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and did not remain, remain in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I doubt that there's very much of the German gold still sitting there in a <span class="BUILDING">bank vault</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Maybe there is some...Jew..some property still there, either gold bars or the things we also consider to be looted property, paintings, silverware, etcetera, not only in the, in the large <span class="BUILDING">Swiss banks</span> , but maybe in some '7 International Refugee Organization: The major organization dedicated to the relief of refugees from the Nazi menace. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Also called the IFO. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">of the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss private banks</span> , or in the hands of individuals in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">It's very, very difficult to, to tell about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I, I think the amounts that we're talking about, that have been talked about recently, are, are substantially exaggerated. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And, about the only thing I would like to add at the present time, is that I think the Swiss are, at the present time, maybe reluctantly and maybe under compulsion, making an effort to do something about it, despite the charges which were made just the other day that all this is on the basis of, of blackmail. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And beyond that, so far as the...my participation in, in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vassanar(ph</span> ) and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> is concerned, about all I can say is that I was, as I said, a member of... was working with the American Jewish Committee, the American Jewish Committee was very, very much involved in these negotiations which set up the negotiations at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vassanar(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I was one of the four people on the, on the Jewish delegation representing the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I think Moe(ph) Levitt(ph) representing the JDC, I representing, I don't know, a variety of organizations, I guess, certainly the American Jewish Committee, a fellow named Alec(ph) Easterman(ph) representing the Conference of, the Board of Jewish Deputies or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And Maurice(ph) Bookstein(ph) who was representing, I guess, the Jewish Agency at, at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And we were the four so-called principal negotiators. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Sitting up on top of us were Jacob(ph) Blaustein(ph) who was then President of the American Jewish Committee, and that absolutely glorious character, Nachem(ph) Goldman(ph) who then was, I guess, President of the Jewish Agency and the World Jewish Congress and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And those were the two who did a lot of negotiating with...on behalf of these claims. </span><span class="sentence" id="629"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nachem</span> in particular was a very...very close to Konrad Adenauer and Jacob Blaustein was absolutely essential, I think, in going to General Clay and other people in the United States government, and they did a wonderful, wonderful job there. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I participated in those negotiations in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> ... went on to be one of the few people together with Nehemiah(ph) Robinson(ph) who thought we would ever get anything out of the Austrians. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And Nehemiah Robinson was with the World Jewish Congress. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">He and I were the only ones who thought negotiating with the Austrians was going to do anything at all because the Austrians had been declared to be an occupied country by the Allies by, way back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> in 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And they were saying, who us? </span><span class="sentence" id="634">We're not guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And then we had some negotiations with the Austrians and in 1955, I initialed an agreement in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> with the entire Austrian cabinet on the other side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> which resulted in the payment of about 50 million dollars into a so-called Hilth(ph) Fund, which was administered by the Jewish organizations, by the Committee for Jewish Claims On <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">The big distinction being that we got a conference for Jewish claims against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but a committee for Jewish claims on <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">It was supposed to reflect the difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And that fund was, as far as I know, administered. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">It was inadequate, but it was something that the Austrians did pay in despite the fact that they were considered to be more liberated than, and an occupied country, than an ally of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And that, I think, is about it.</span></p>
