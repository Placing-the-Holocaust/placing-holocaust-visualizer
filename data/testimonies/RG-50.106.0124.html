ANSWER:  Nothing of any kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">We had liberated some Canadian and U.S. Army or U.S. Air Force prisoner of war camps previous to this and we thought this was another prisoner of war camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">And when the troops and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and our half-tracks entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , we couldn’t believe what we saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I was a kid, I really was a naive kid and when I saw the bodies lying around, it — it really got to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Some were just thrown in the corner and some were piled in blocks of five, five going one way, five July 14, 1993 going another way, and — like cordwood. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And they had tags attached to their toes. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">We were there — as it was getting dark that evening, we were wandering around. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">We were warned, do not feed the prisoners, but we were hungry ourselves and we had K rations and C rations, which were almost indigestible to the soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And these people were starving and we gave them frankfurters and beans and we almost killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">We really did, their stomach couldn’t take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Then a young lady came up to me, who I thought was in her 30’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">It turned out she was 19, and through an interpreter — she kept pointing to a mezuzah that I was wearing around my neck, a little silver cylinder given to me by my grandmother ... [tape break] — young lady said that she was 19 years old and that the German guards had ka — had kept her alive as she was a plaything for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And they gave in — in return they kept her out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> and they gave her food. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">She kept pointing to the mezuzah and I took it off and I gave it to her and I showed her and with her hairpins he pulled the shi — my — I didn't even know there was a paper in the mezuzah, it was a very small cylinder. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">She started to cry and said it was the first Hebrew that she had seen in years and years, because they had burnt everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I took off the mezuzah and I gave it to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">She started to cry and she grabbed me around the legs and she was hysterical and — anyway, we — that was the last I saw of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">The army —

<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  How long do you think you were there [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Oh, I was only there maybe four or five hours —
QUESTION:  Four or five hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , we had to keep going. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I wrote my mother that night to tell her mother to forgive me, but I gave away the mezuzah in a concen — in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And I forgot about it, I mean it took several weeks for the letter to go over and it took several more weeks for an answer to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">She told me that she had told a neighbor what had occurred and that neighbor told another neighbor and before I knew it I began to receive shoeboxes full of mezuzahs. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I must have received 50 to a hundred mezuzahs from all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">What do you do with a hundred mezuzahs? </span><span class="sentence" id="30">We were now past the July 14, 1993 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and we — there was nobody to give them to. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">So I gave them to the chaplains and they said, some of them, they would distribute them. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And now I still had a— a whole bunch of mezuzahs left. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So I went to my southern soldiers, the people in my company, who were mostly from <span class="REGION">Alabama</span> and <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span> and <span class="REGION">Georgia</span> — not too bright, but they were very good soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And I gave them the mezuzahs and I told them that these were good luck charms and that if they wore these mezuzahs when th — but they were not to put them on til they got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , because then they would have endless erections. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And they believed me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  They did, huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  All Jews are rich and all Jews are smart and I wouldn’t lie to them.</span></p>

QUESTION:  I bet those were their very prized possessions, then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  And not only that, but I said, if you have — if you take more than one, you should put it on the <span class="DLF">door</span> to the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , it will bring you very good luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And to — for all I know there is still in the backwoods of <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span> and <span class="REGION">Georgia</span> and <span class="REGION">Alabama</span> , there may be some mezuzahs up on the <span class="DLF">doorways</span> .</span></p>

ANSWER:  And I’m sure they did have endless erections when they did get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and that’s my story with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="44">tape break]
QUESTION:  — had some wonderful detail about the <span class="DLF">road</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and how it was towards the end of the war and they were moving so fast that the food drops couldn’t keep up with you and sta — moto — motor oil was a priority, that — that you were without [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  No —- oh — wi - oh no, it — w-we were with the third army and we were moving so rapidly that we had no time to have food. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We couldn’t — we were running out of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Patton says find the food wherever you can get it in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  Don’t <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored units</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I mean, they always —
ANSWER:  Yes, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored units</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  — prepare [indecipherable] thing —
ANSWER:  Either get off the <span class="DLF">road</span> , or get out — anyway, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> were dropping supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">The first thing that they dropped was fuel for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Then they dropped medical supplies and by this time, when we were supposed to get the food, we were running out of gas again, so they came back and they kept dropping diesel fuel or gasoline, whatever they burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And we never did get th-the food that we needed, so we had to live off the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> , which wasn’t very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">But we found food. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">We did find enough to keep going, and we went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and July 14, 1993 we passed the <span class="BUILDING">Munich stadium</span> with a huge swastika up on the — on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And I remember that the company — well, the battalion commander had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> fire their tank guns and blow it away, which was very exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And that afternoon, late that afternoon we got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  Did you go through this town <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , or did you approach [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  No, I don’t remember that, I remember going through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and that took awhile to get through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And then — I don’t remember the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> at all, all I remember is going through the <span class="DLF">gates</span> , the wooden <span class="DLF">gates</span> that were busted open and going into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  Were there other American soldiers there before you, or were you all the [indecipherable] the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  I — there must have been, coming — cause they were coming from all directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Several directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  And I do remember that another person — it’s coming back to me, gave me a cat of nine tai — no, this girl that I gave the mezuzah to gave me a — an object wrapped in a towel, which was about eight inches long, a wooden handle, it had nine leather thongs, and stuck in the leather thongs were carpet tacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And they were beaten with these things and the flesh was ripped off and some of the tacks still had pieces of flesh on the tacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And I had kept that for awhile, and then I just threw it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I July 14, 1993 — what the hell did I need it for? </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And that was one of the souvenirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">We had a German flag, which I think I still have, and it was a very sad time in my life, and ya — being 19 — 19 or 20 years old at the time, it made a very strong impression on me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Was there any sort of counseling offered —

<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  — this was a very traumatic experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  We just kept going until we — they stopped us, we were in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> for a couple of weeks, and then they — slowly they pulled us back to — the lucky — what we called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cigarette camps</span> , luck — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Lucky Strike</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Old Gold</span> , and from these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , which were right near the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> , we waited for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to come to take us to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Our division was scheduled to be the assault division on Honshu Island, the Japanese invasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">We got back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I spent that — oh, a week or so on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for a leg injury. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on a recuperative leave and during the recuperative leave, they dropped the atomic bong — bomb on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hiroshima</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">That was the end of the war, and Harry July 14, 1993 Truman saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I did not have to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , and according to the army officers when we did get to <span class="REGION">California</span> , the life expectancy of our division was 20 minutes, and then the next wave would come in, then the following wave, and I was supposed to be in the assault wave.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  He did save your life, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  So it saved — it saved my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  And quite a few others, I’m sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  Oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  Really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  Many thousands of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So we were always grateful for Harry Truman for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">However, after going through the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and seeing what Roosevelt didn’t do, it was very upsetting to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I never really knew that he really laid back like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I was not aware of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  There was a great, great deal known in the political and military highest circles, and very little done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  And when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , my daughter and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad Vashem</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  And you take <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad Vashem</span> added with this and it’s an unbelievable experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And I wrote in the memo book downstairs that if for any reason they built July 14, 1993 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to put the Jews in it, there would be no shortage of guards and no shortage of anything, there would be many volunteers. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And it’s unfortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So I don’t think we have learned a thing from history.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  Human nature has not changed substantially, it seems.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  All you have to do is look around the world today at — almost every conflict has something to do with religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  Whether it’s Arab and Muslim or Protestant and Catholic, I mean 1-1t — it’s all there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  Do you think that you would have been — one of the things that we ask people about 1s how politically cognizant they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Do you think that you would be as aware of the conflicts around the world now if you had not gone through this experience, or if you did not have Jewish background upbringing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Well, I am —
QUESTION:  Has it sensitized you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  Iam more sensitive to what’s going on around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  You must remember in 1943 - 1944, there was no communications like they had today. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I mean, you have CNN showing you what’s happening as it happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">We had July 14, 1993 nothing like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">We had a newspaper that came out days and weeks later and it was controlled by the army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  So what they told us, or what we read was strictly what they wanted us to hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And that’s my story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Couple — couple more questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Do you remember, when you were inside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , obviously there were other people from your team, your battalion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  Do you remember any of their reactions? </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Did anybody get sick?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  The doctor, who was the battalion doctor, his name was Dr. Rosenberg, he himself became sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And he tried, with what limited medical facilities he had, he tried to help these people, but there was malnutrition, there was starvation, 1t was sores, it was beatings, it wa — whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And he really wasn’t prepared for this kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">He — his stuff was for gunshot wounds and things like that, 1t wasn’t for starving and malnutrition. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">But he was trying to come around and tell us, don’t give them franks and beans, you’ll kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But these people were starving, so we gave them biscuits and whatever canned goods we had, we had to open it for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And July 14, 1993 then — it’s coming back to me, two of the, or three of the men pointed out to somebody that looked like one of them, and he was younger and healthy looking, he was one of the guards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  And they wanted him. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And we —
QUESTION:  What happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  — we gave him the — we searched him and he was screaming, no, no, I’m — but they all claimed he was one of the brutal guards, and we — they took him into one of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and they killed him with their bare hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And I never went into —
QUESTION:  We have had — we have had other reports of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  We have had other reports of that, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  Well, I didn’t go in to check on it, but I heard the scream. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">They did it with their bare hands, they killed this guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And —
QUESTION:  Did you find or see other German guards laying around the <span class="REGION">premises</span> that you think perhaps the inmates had [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Many of them had changed into — from what we had heard, they changed into civilian clothes and many of them got away. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">But others that were pointed out were taken by the MPs, and what happened to them, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Also, when we July 14, 1993 liberated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp there</span> were many, many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> lying around. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And they wanted — prisoners of the — they wanted to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , wherever they came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">What did we know? </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Here, take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And they got on their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , they got as far as the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and then they were stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">They had to be interviewed, they had to be examined, you know, so they never got more than a couple of hundred yards, but we gave them all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And —
QUESTION:  Did you and your — the soldiers who were with you, did you discuss this in the following days? </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Did you talk about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  First of all, many of them wore the yellow Star of David [indecipherable] Jude.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  I did not see that patch downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I mean, I saw patches but I did not see the yellow Star of David that said j-u-d — or j-u-d-e, I don’t really remember at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And they really — I told them that these were all Jewish people and that they were being persecuted. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And these Southerners really, they were sorry to see that, you know, anybody was put — but they didn’t seem to care that they were Jewish or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Hm, so they did not understand the significance of the whole [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  No, yi— Il tell you all — I did, but they didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">July 14, 1993
ANSWER:  They did not, and again you were dealing with people who were farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Some of them could not write, barely. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">They could barely read. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I had to tie their shoelaces for them, I had to make their necktie for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But if you said to them, walk through that <span class="DLF">wall</span> , they would walk through that <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I mean, that’s what the army wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">They didn’t want you to think too much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  So they would have been very, either historically or politically ignorant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  Yes, we all —
QUESTION:  They just simply weren’t exposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Well, I was ignorant of what I was getting into and I was a hell of a lot brighter than they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I mean, I had — I had one year of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , and I knew I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I was Bar Mitzvahed, I knew something about my religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">But —
QUESTION:  Before you went overseas, I would think that you would have been at least clearly aware that Hitler’s main focus was against the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Were you aware of that from newspapers back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , or —
ANSWER:  Yeah, we knew about the anti-Semitism, we knew about Crystal Night and things like that, but we had no idea there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And —

<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  I guess because there was the depression and things were very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And like today, whenever things get tough, they need a scapegoat and the scapegoat throughout history has always been the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And they were willing to listen to him, and hey here — look at these, they have <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , and they were lawyers and they were bankers. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Not all of them, but enough of them that were very visible, and they were very easy to go after them. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Tha-That’s my reasoning, I don’t know if history supports my contention.</span></p>
