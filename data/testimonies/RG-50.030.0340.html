ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  I'm going to back track a little and ask if you had any knowledge of the group who were operating in that <span class="REGION">area</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1">A. Yes, Ido, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">At that time, because history was repeating itself, the same kind of Germans I saw in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">The same kind of groups were entering the city of ; surrounding <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Everybody out, men out. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">They were wearing those black uniforms, and they were a petrifying force. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">You know that if they leave and you're still alive, just count your blessing. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">It's your happy hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">There was never any assuredness that once you are surrounded them that you will escape from their clutches. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">It was never your choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">They either had enough people, or got what they wanted and left, but you really had no control over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">If they were looking for men or they suspected somebody was hiding, they didn't hesitate to enter the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and bang around and look around and you're just standing there like a little mouse, or a big mouse, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Q. Were these organized groups or just bands of thugs. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Were they all Germans? </span><span class="sentence" id="14">A. Well, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">They were pretty organized, very disciplined, very impressive and their posture and their self assurance. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I mean they were the Lord and Masters. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">What they were before, we had no knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We just found out what kind of people were there, but they were the heros of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">They had the power over that bundle of nothing, because the Jews became nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">See, we stopped being human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So, yes, we were aware of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Q. How did you know these were the group, and did they have local auxiliaries? </span><span class="sentence" id="23">A. Well, the soldiers were not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Soldiers were fighting the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Those were special groups with one purpose, round up the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">They were wearing different kinds of uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">There was one group which was wearing the brown uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">That was a , they were working on construction of <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">When they used to come in, and ask for people, you were pretty much assured that you are just going to go for a day, work on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">When the group came, you didn't think you would ever come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Q. Did they have local support? </span><span class="sentence" id="32">A. Not in . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">They had it everywhere else starting from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> to whatever, they had full local support. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Q. How did you learn what happened to these people who were taken away‚Äù? </span><span class="sentence" id="35">A. Well, first of all, many a times they used to take another group of people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">That became more clear in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> than in any <span class="NPIP">place</span> else because that's where the mass destruction took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">In it was just a group of men, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But somebody had to dig the <span class="DLF">graves</span> and somebody had to cover the <span class="DLF">graves</span> , and the Germans weren't going to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So, people were called to go to work and sometimes sneaked back they were telling tales and to us they were just tales, because no that couldn't happen, wouldn't happen, didn't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">It took quite a few years until the real idea penetrated to everybody that that's what the Germans do. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">That they were such masters in psychology because sometimes when they round up people for work, the people really went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Sometimes when they round up people for work, the people were going to <span class="DLF">killing grounds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">You never knew what's what. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">So, they kind of dulled your senses and there was always the hope, so you'd just go like cattle to the <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">That was that massive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno--</span> in that it became very pronounced in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Q. In were you aware of any efforts to the people to get away to form a resistance group, anything like that? </span><span class="sentence" id="47">A. No, not really in . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Resistance towards what? </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Get away where? </span><span class="sentence" id="50">It was not that time to escape so where do you go? </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Who is going to help you? </span><span class="sentence" id="52">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Q. In all the time that you were there, you've now been away from your family a few years, what went through your mind? </span><span class="sentence" id="54">A. Through my mind that my family is probably no longer is alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">That's the more I was exposed to the politics and the behavior of the Germans towards the Jews, the more I knew that the chances for any of us to survive are not tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So, I really didn't think that my family is alive, and I really did not choose to have a picture of how they died because it wasn't very clear in my mind either, how. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Did they come and round them up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> like they did, the people when I witnessed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Did they take another turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I didn't know much about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> , either. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I knew about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I was there, but not the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Interesting that after the war, and I'm ahead of my story, I found out that almost each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was operated on a different wave length. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">There were different methods with different people, different way of administration, it was just not known to me then. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I knew how the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno Ghetto</span> operated because I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I knew how the operated because I was there, but I didn't have a scale of comparison at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So, lots of the things especially of other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish communities</span> and how they handled their <span class="DLF">killing grounds</span> and their being alive, I found out later but not then. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I still am talking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettos</span> , which is quite different than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Q. This is probably a strange question, but by thinking that your family was probably not alive any more, did that free you at all from having to worry about then and think about them? </span><span class="sentence" id="70">A. No, it did not free me from thinking about them, but it freed me for independent action. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I can move around. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I can hide in the <span class="DLF">doorway</span> or not hide int he <span class="DLF">doorway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I don't have to worry well if I hide and my little sister and mother are in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> upstairs, I have a certain responsibility, So, yes, I was free. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">There were a lot of people who had family. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I was more lonely, I was more not belonging, but I was freer. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And I used that freedom later on in many occasions. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Yes, and I probably used it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Would I be with my family, Mrs. Pollock wouldn't take care of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">She wouldn't find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Maybe my family would, but we were not natives of that particular <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so I can't weight it, but if you can put it in those terms, there were certain advantages of being alone if you found helping hands from other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I was not just an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I could have never done it without their help of strangers, who really didn't want any reward. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Q. So, you went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno Ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="84">A. I went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno Ghetto</span> , and that young lady befriended me. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">What I didn't do in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno Ghetto</span> , which was required, I did not register. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So, I wasn't on any lists, but by now some people who are before and they were living there so I was kind of a free agent, but I did not register. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So, when the actions came, I was not on the list. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Q. And you knew this? </span><span class="sentence" id="89">This was intentional? </span><span class="sentence" id="90">A. Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And I knew at that point enough people who would say there's going to be an action. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I knew a lot of policemen because young men or women were policemen and some of them were more devoted to the cause very important were their jobs, and other ones just let functionaries because it's necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So,I remember at least three or four actions where people were lined up and I was warned they're going to round them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Twice I stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> because I had a job outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I stayed not on my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I couldn't do that, but I knew there was an empty <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where I was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So, instead of gig back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , I just crawled under a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">The next day I just crawled out and was back on the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I couldn't do it if | would have obligations towards my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Would I rather not have a family and have that freedom? </span><span class="sentence" id="101">No, but that wasn't my choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">At other times there was actions in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno Ghetto</span> , and they were very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Anyway, it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">The Germans gave the commandant, was the commandant of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno Ghetto</span> , gave him a list that many thousand people he needs today, next week, next month, whatever the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I was hidden in a <span class="INT_SPACE">policemen's room</span> when he was on duty, I wouldn't say <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> -- cubical, but I had to be a quiet as could be because that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the other Jewish police would not come because it was the policemen quarter. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So, I might lie under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> for two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Again, I was lucky, fortunate at one of the actions, especially the last liquidation when the police had no control I watched the Germans when they finished with one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , I kind of got into the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where they finished getting everybody out. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So, no, it wasn't a calculated kind of action, it was spontaneous, whatever the situation was, and I was getting away with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Lots of people did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Q. You were doing this on your own? </span><span class="sentence" id="111">A. Well, I had nobody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Well, when I say on my own, yes, but there was always someone helping a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Like if I knew someone who knew there was going to be an action that particular day. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I did what I did on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Q. You didn't hide with other people? </span><span class="sentence" id="116">A. No. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Q. Were there actions all the time? </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I mean was it a pretty fearful <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="119">A. Very. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Very, very fearful, very insecure, and I really didn't belong any <span class="NPIP">place</span> so I didn't have a permanent <span class="NPIP">place</span> so to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Yes, so it was very fearful and I had no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I didn't know influential people, and that always helps. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">There was a lot of it going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I imagine you could buy out your <span class="NPIP">place</span> on an action. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I was a newcomer to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> and again, the same policy, let's get rid of the Jews who came later here, who came from the surrounding <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So, yes, it was a very fearful <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">There was also a group of people from in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> who were very involved in the resistance of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And, I guess it was a fairly large group, but the majority of the inhabitants of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> did not want to rock the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> as long as somebody else goes out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , let's not get the Germans in because then we are all going to be destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Well, they had different views of it, and it was even argued then. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Is it right for to get his police to round up that many Jews because the Germans wanted and they assured you the choice of who was going to go will be yours and not the Germans at random, or should we just the hell with that, fight it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">The majority of the population of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> did not want an uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Q. They supported ? </span><span class="sentence" id="133">A. Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And they opposed the groups who wanted to arm themselves and they really opposed it because that was a fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">The Germans find out, they enter the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , and we'll all going to be destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So, I am not passing judgment. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I'm just telling you what the mood was. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Q. Were you involved in any resistance? </span><span class="sentence" id="139">A. I personally was not involved in any resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I was involved in nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I was just trying to survive without harming anyone, but I knew a lot of people who did. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Q. The people that you knew who were involved in resistance activities, what sorts of things were they doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="143">A. First of all, they were trying to get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and bring ammunition in to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">When the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was in the process -- very shortly before the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was liquidated, they- I don't know if I'm going ahead or not-- but anyway, that group set against -- you compile your lists if you believe that that might save any Jews but don't touch us. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And they all collected in one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> with all their ammunition and it was a known secret to everyone that that <span class="NPIP">place</span> belongs to that so-called underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">It no longer was underground, but that's where they sat and they set the guns if the Germans ever come into that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and touch that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we let loose. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">The Germans respected it. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They didn't touch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Well, eventually they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">They had all the time in the world, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Q. Was this a fairly large group? </span><span class="sentence" id="152">A. I wouldn't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Not enough to do more damage to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I have to die, if you Germans would die, but there was a much larger group that did not want to resist the Germans knowing how hopeless it would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And I believe against this, and probably other commandants too, that as long as he can keep the Germans out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> there is a chance of saving one, two, five, twenty Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">But was married to a non-Jewish person, and really could have stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">He eventually was killed, but two or three or days before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was liquidated they called him to <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and evidently said they're coming into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> if he doesn't supply whatever, and he said enough is enough, so they just got rid of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Then they stormed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Q. Daily life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="160">A. That depends on the times. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">When the actions were going to take place or were taking place or shortly after they took place, there was a very depressing mood, very frightened, very scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Then, as I say the Germans were wonderful in allowing your feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Life was kind of normal for a Ghetto life. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">You used to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">You used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">If you were a young group of people, there was a <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> on the corner and the young people used to gather together and sing some songs, until the next episode would take place. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Q. Were there cultural activities? </span><span class="sentence" id="168">A. Not organized cultural activities, not that I was aware of, and I certainly have no claim of knowing everything that was going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I was I imagine a pretty narrow minded person myself, but from what I knew it was rather spirit building. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">We're still alive, we cannot sit still and think, not the younger people. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And if I remember correctly, there was in that little <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> was aI remember the number was 31, the name of the <span class="DLF">street</span> probably will come back to me, and it kind of lifted your spirit up, because none of us really believed that we are going to survive it. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">So, there were love affairs going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Whatever normal does in normal circumstances under abnormal circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">The ethical standards were not the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">There was no code of ethics. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">There was none of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Q. Why do you say that? </span><span class="sentence" id="178">What does that mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="179">A. It means that things you would do when you were brought up in nice <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> before the war, there were things you wouldn't do. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">You wouldn't make love so easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Q. What else? </span><span class="sentence" id="182">A. I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Just the whole outlook of did you hear that was taken on an action, this one- it wasn't as bad as it became later. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So, there was still kind of a measure, can I help you, or this one instead of that one justifying witnessing certain actions. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">That was not normal behavior. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So, you tried to keep some feel of sanity knowing that it's not the same as <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I mean you don't buy your life for money. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I mean you don't do that <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">You might very easily do that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> if you can help it. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Q. Did you steal from other people, tell on your neighbors? </span><span class="sentence" id="191">A. Sometimes you would do that, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">It became much more pronounced later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="193"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> still had some semblance, and I use that word very cautiously, of family life. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So, yes, there was a police over you. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">There were some zealous policemen if you were not supposed to have onions in your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they found a piece of onion on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> or a crumb, yes, you would be denounced. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">You would be punished. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Is that normal behavior, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So, other ones tried to say-- but there was still some family life. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I didn't have one. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I belonged no <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but lots of people did. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Q. You had a social life? </span><span class="sentence" id="202">A. What social life. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I was just floating around. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I had no roots. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I had no responsibilities, and I did not get involved in any underground, so I went to work and said well, what do I do tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">How do I escape the next day or how do I survive the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So, it was a very selfish kind of existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Q. What about <span class="BUILDING">institutions</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , like <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> or <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> , did that kind of thing exist? </span><span class="sentence" id="209">A. Not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Not to my knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Q. It didn't have the organization that some of these other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettos</span> has? </span><span class="sentence" id="212">A. I don't think. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I am not aware of it, and I think I would have been aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Who would support that <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="215">There were no supplies coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">There was no funds. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Q. What about hunger, disease, things like that? </span><span class="sentence" id="218">A. Yes, hunger was becoming more and more pronounced because as I said it was semi- normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">A lot of products were brought into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> by the people who did not live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> before and there was a lot of <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> and people were hiding things. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">But then there were people who just got the normal rations and they were not very big. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">So, yes, hunger was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Q. Were people sick? </span><span class="sentence" id="223">A. People were sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">People were hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">People were unhappy, their heads were always down. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">It was just how do I survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">How do I survive every day living and how do I survive the outside world. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Q. I'm trying to picture this. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">If I were looking at the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno Ghetto</span> , not during an action, but just on a day, what would I see? </span><span class="sentence" id="230">A. You would see people milling around and moving around. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Just lots of people small <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno Ghetto</span> was not tremendous and not necessarily dressed up, and not necessarily friendly and not necessarily -- just different needs and when you would go on the <span class="DLF">Wilno streets</span> outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , those were lovely <span class="DLF">streets</span> , lovely people. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And you occasionally might see Jews because when the Jews were going to work, they were going through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> , but not on the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">They all wore stars. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">They all were being led by someone. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">So, you did see it, so whoever tells you we didn't know just is lying. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">You could not not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So, that's just a cop out and the majority of the population believes this statement. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I just read an interesting -- it's not my own quotation, but somebody wrote it in a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">That when you hear today or heard after the war how helpful the outside population was, how many thousand helpful people there were, it is very surprising that even one single Jew was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Q. Was there much observation of religion in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="242">A. Individually, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">People became a little bit more religious looking for help. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">There was no help from the outside world, so they were looking for help from God. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Q. Was this done in families or were there actually <span class="BUILDING">prayer houses</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="246">A. No, families, as far as I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Q. What kind of work did you do when you were living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno Ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="248">A. When I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> I was working in a <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , cleaning. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">That was usually a very good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">It was not on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , 1t wasn't in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , so those were plum jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Q. How did you get it? </span><span class="sentence" id="252">A. I knew someone who needed ten people because he was in command of and he said, "Hey Bella, I'll put you on that." </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I said great. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Q. So you were working for a Lithuanian family, a German family? </span><span class="sentence" id="255">A. I'm trying to remember because I didn't work very much because I had no connections so occasionally I used to get ajob. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">It was a German family. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Q. How long were you in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno Ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="258">A. A few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Not very long, but I was one of the last ones to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Q. How did the end come about, can you tell me? </span><span class="sentence" id="261">A. The endcame about when ___ refused the last remnants of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Q. How many people are we talking about that were still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> approximately? </span><span class="sentence" id="263">A. I would say approximately 2,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Then the Germans came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and they started rounding up Jews at random. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">At that point, I tried to avoid them, found myself in some <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">People were building precautionary places. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I found myself in a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I stayed there overnight until the next morning when the actions were going on upstairs, I was downstairs, and the next day everybody was chased out. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">We were brought to a big <span class="BUILDING">market</span> , and we found there people who were chased out the day before right there assembled. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">So, we were the last remnants of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> ready marked for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Q. How did you know <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="273">A. Well, at that point, we're talking about 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">We knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">We knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pornaty</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I don't know whether you know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pornaty</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Before the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> were working, and before it was beautiful organized mechanized, they used to get people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">They had a transport bring them to the forest of Pornaty. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Those dug their own <span class="DLF">graves</span> and then they had to line up and were killed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">All of a sudden the Germans found an enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Not from the dead or the living, but the whole <span class="DLF">grounds</span> lifted up. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">They could not absorb all that blood and whatever, so those thing had to be dug out. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Those were the Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> were brought in, dug out the <span class="DLF">graves</span> and put some petroleum and burned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">We were fully aware of what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pornaty</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Q. As people came back? </span><span class="sentence" id="286">A. Some of them snuck out. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Some of them were killed, stayed there in the <span class="DLF">grave</span> for two days until they dug themselves out until they got back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So, at that point we were fully aware that there is only one way for the Jews, that's <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And that was after the conference, after the solution of how to take care of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So, there really is not much hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">There certainly wouldn't be much hope that anybody is going to help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Q. You got information about this? </span><span class="sentence" id="293">A. Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">That was at that point and when the first people came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pornaty</span> and told us what happened, there was total disbelief. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">No human being can do that to another human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">No human being is going to allow them to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">So, illusions. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">So when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno Ghetto</span> was liquidated, that must have been September '43 I think, those people were all -- it was warm, hungry, thirsty, frightened, Germans were all around with their dogs, and then they marched through the <span class="DLF">gates</span> started. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Came my turn, there were two SS men pointing left, right, which is standard procedure as we're going. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I happened to be pointed to go right. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Just the same, there was a small group of very young girls, the majority was going left and was put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and off they went and new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> came and off they went, and we just stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Then we were put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and that was my last view of the population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Q. How many people were with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="304">A. 200 out of 2,000, 4,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Why me? </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">We didn't know where we were going, but you were just going. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Whatever he said, left or right, that's where you went. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">You were brought in on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and then after a while we were loaded into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> and the <span class="DLF">doors</span> closed and we were just taking off. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">We had no idea where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">The <span class="DLF">doors</span> never opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">We weren't fed. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">The situation in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">People became just wild. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">No <span class="DLF">air</span> , no food, little human dignity left. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">You know, two or three days -- once they stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and brought some buckets of water in, and that probably was a bigger disaster than not having water. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I don't know, because the worst element of your personality was coming throughout. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">After about three days, I would guess, of that voyage, the <span class="DLF">doors</span> opened up and everybody i, ; , SO you just jump out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and I was faced, and the rest of the people with me was faced with a group of German soldiers with bayonets and some kind of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Now, my thought was knowing what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pornaty</span> , that that's the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Now, they're just going to get rid of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">They didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">After everybody was out, we all of a sudden see some people in striped uniforms, and they speak Jewish and they say don't worry you're . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">They brought us that group of people, which they brought on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> , they brought us to a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> with straw then all of a sudden this creature comes through the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , starched white blouse, red kerchief, black pants with a whip in her hand and here we are a bundle of nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I mean, just unbelievable impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Well, we did get to to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> , unknown to me at that time, but made known to me later that as we were on the <span class="DLF">Wilno grounds</span> , the commandant of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> called the commandant and said, "Hey, I killed all my women in and now I have 200 hands to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Do you still have some available?" </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And he did, and I was one of them, so I got myself to instead of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Q. So you arrived in ? </span><span class="sentence" id="329">A. Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And that whole group, they were only women, no men. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">The next day they wrote our numbers and that was the point where I stopped being a person and became a number. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">The whole set up life changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">There were no more family units. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">It was just a group of inhabitants, or a group of Jews, eventually for slaughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">We stayed in that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> for about two days, until we were named, and in the meantime a group of people were selected for work, and the type of work that all suitcases was closing had to be sorted and put away. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I was chosen for that job too, so it was a group of I don't know, twenty girls, something. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Then, the next morning, the ones who were there the day before were selected for the same job. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And that eventually became my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Q. Was there any particular way you got chosen for that? </span><span class="sentence" id="340">A. I would say it would be random. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">In the meantime, once we all got numbers, and I remember mine like today, it was 5633. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">We were put into <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Everybody was assigned a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and out clothes were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">We got striped clothes and we became full fledged inmates of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">There were other people in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> people that got there before us. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">They were not women because they were killed off. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">There was some German women and there was some German men. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Then the selection of work started. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Again, you had an entirely different hierarchy. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">No longer did you have a Judenrot. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">The people in charge of us were Germans -- not Germans, soldiers, but prisoners of war, criminals, people who were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> for crimes committed, and all of a sudden they became the elite of the --snapping their fingers. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">They could do whatever they pleased. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Power thirsty and just brutes, real honest to goodness brutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Q. In what way? </span><span class="sentence" id="355">A. Abusive, beating, snap command because they were dealing with vermin, not human beings anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">They were just outright criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">The guy that was in charge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> Mr. Ickes, was there for killing his wife and her boyfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">There were other ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Some of them were political prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">They were nicer. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">The difference with them was they were all wearing little triangles, the black triangles designated one crime. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Then we had the commandant who was a German SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">We had some German SS supervising some internal functions of . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And then we had some Jewish supervisors supervised by German guards who were working outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="365">really was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">collection camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">They used to bring Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">It was an interesting <span class="NPIP">place</span> when you learned later about geography and happenings. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">was a very important <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">The Germans did not do their killing on <span class="REGION">German grounds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">They exported the Jews and the minute they left the borders of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they no longer were German citizens and they just joined the of the Jewish work. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">So, anyway, we had columns of people going out to work, different kind of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">There were <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> in who needed chap labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">There were all kind of things, and then there were places where the Jews who came into were selected and sent to other little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> where they slept and ate and again were under other supervision, but they all belonged to that <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I stayed in <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">That became my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I was not sent out to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I hada permanent job in the so called . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Lused to take mostly care of the German uniforms, which were cleaned and darned and then they used to come and exchange their uniforms for uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">It was part of the big who used to get all the suitcases if you equivalent to the Auschwitz commando. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">It was equivalent in the way of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">All the Germans used to be brought in Czechs who came by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and suitcases and under pretense of <span class="NPIP">paradise</span> , all their baggage was taken away and was sent to and we used to sort the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Put valuables separate, ladies clothes, furs, and you know when you go on a voyage and leave everything behind, you take the very best with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">So, the people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had a hey day because all those things were taken by the Germans and sent to their wives, their lovers, their whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">So, anyway, that was the assignment I had among other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Q. So, in doing this, how did it feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Sort of strange going through other people's lives in a way? </span><span class="sentence" id="387">A. Yes, very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Heartbreaking, if you had a heart left. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">When I say there were different standards of viewing life, that was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">What pride. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">There was only the strongest who tried to keep on resemblance of a human being because the Germans did everything possible to destroy it in you and then you are . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">SO, and you did see it over and over among the surroundings of the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> 1n the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , how they behaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">How some tried to keep clean no matter what. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Others did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Some tried to walk with a high head, others would just --1t's awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And then there always were some people above you. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">There always was that fear, that anxiety. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">So, it was not easy to keep your dignity about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">There was nothing to feed it on. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">But still we managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I think that was one of the biggest victories that the Jews showed, that they did remain with some dignity in spite of so many losing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And to me, every survivor is a hero if they could withstand all that and then join the world and become useful citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">So, heroism isn't necessarily groups of soldiers attacking and doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">That wasn't heroism because hunger was rampant. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Actions were taking place. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">You had to separate from your loved ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">If you came together, men went one way, women went another way. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Children went the third way. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">They still came with children from some <span class="NPIP">places</span> and then you being separated and so that's what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">But, I think in that particular time you don't compare. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">I didn't know about other ones and I thought that was <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I find out differently, but I had -- talking about my luck being at the right <span class="NPIP">place</span> at the right time is just unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">I was working in the and just before Christmas '43, I would imagine, fire broke out in the , and the burned down. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Now, I was working there, and I was one of the last ones to leave the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and the next day I was summoned to an interview with Doctor Longer, and if you're familiar with the literature of the Holocaust a bit, he was one of the biggest sadist in the establishment of the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And when my name was called to be interviewed by him, everybody who knew me was sure that was the last they'd see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">He interviewed me for two hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I don't know if I was dumb, naive, stupid or something, I don't know what he was fishing for, but I didn't have to avoid what he was fishing for because I had no idea what he was fishing for, but he interviewed me in a very kind way for two hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">He dismissed me back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="419">But those were the ways of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Now, he's known to be the biggest brute. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">He was in charge of all the Jews in that part of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">All the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and so on, the biggest sadist ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">End of Tape 2 Tape 3 A.

What about trading these clothes for extra food? </span><span class="sentence" id="438">A. Lots of people did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">When they had access to it, lots of people did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">It was just an instinct in some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I never needed very much, so I had no need to do it, or desire, or was too scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I might have just been scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Q.

Yes, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And there were lots of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> coming in and some of them were sent out to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">We had no <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> around, so either the people were shot or they went to other <span class="NPIP">places</span> to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So, that was a fairly mild <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , I would say, on a scale of comparison. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Q. Where were these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> coming from? </span><span class="sentence" id="449">A. Mostly <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">As time progressed and more and more Jews were sent out from Europe, that's where they were coming from. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And there was a little sleepy <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , a , and God 1s that clear in my mind, all those SS standing there when the <span class="DLF">doors</span> opened and those hundreds of people giving out and I did visit that <span class="NPIP">place</span> after the war and it was just mind boggling. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Peaceful, quiet, what Jews, what <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> , what Hitler, what Germans, none of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Q.

In ,no I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Not in . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">What was happening to me personally let's say in , | found since we no longer have any home life, any home things, that we were just individuals bonding and developing of new families was fabulous. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I still have now -- it's 55 years later -- I still have friends in who we see very often, meet very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">It's like family. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And such friendship did develop I think much more in concentration camp than any <span class="NPIP">place</span> else. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I don't know about other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , but we had very strong ties to people whom we didn't know before. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Q. You would help each other? </span><span class="sentence" id="466">A. Oh, morally, it was just and I have about five, six, seven friends who are just wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I met some wonderful, wonderful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I met my husband there, not this one. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I met him to, but another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Q. When you weren't working, how did you and your new friends spend your time? </span><span class="sentence" id="471">A. Just sitting on the wooden planks talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">There was no entertainment. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">There was no stimulation of -- there was nothing to feed your mind or expand it or look what happens <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">We were completely cut off from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">There was no communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">So, you just bonded with yourself, trying to remember, keep strong, that's not what you're going to become if you ever survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">That was my thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Now, that's not the way to behave. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">All those little things. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">There was nothing to feed our minds and develop us. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettos</span> had <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and what not. </span><span class="sentence" id="482"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Concentration camps</span> did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">My <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Q. What did you dream about? </span><span class="sentence" id="485">A. In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , I imagine freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">That was a farfetched dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I know what I'm dreaming of now, it's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Q. When you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , did you think about what you would do if you got out? </span><span class="sentence" id="489">A. As a profession? </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Q. Just your life? </span><span class="sentence" id="491">A. I didn't know what I'd do with my life, but I knew I was not going to carry my education from concentration outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I'm not going to slam my fist and say you owe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">If I want to become a part of society and evidently if I want freedom, that's what I want, that I will have to adjust and nobody else is going to adjust to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Q. You thought this at the time? </span><span class="sentence" id="495">A. Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And that was my firm conviction. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Maybe that's what you are talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Q. Anything more about just the physical conditions at ? </span><span class="sentence" id="499">A. physical conditions were not too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">There were three <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Two for women, one for men and then there was an extra <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> for non-Jewish workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Q. How many in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="503">A. There wasn't so many in , So 1t couldn't be too tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">But my husband built ; Q. Your husband now? </span><span class="sentence" id="505">A. No. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Q. Your former husband? </span><span class="sentence" id="507">A. Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">He built , so he was an excellent architect, so he built it well. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">There was a lot of stealing of material from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> so we had <span class="INT_SPACE">washrooms</span> , which is just not the usual feature of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">So, that's why I say was not the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Once you survived, once you're there, once you worked, it was not worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">We used to take walks. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I remember my girlfriend and I we were 17 or 18 and we walked for hours around, around, and around talking about our families. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">I had a sister and I had mother and I had a this and how was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And that friend of mine, she's very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">It was in that she was sent out on what we call , different <span class="NPIP">locations</span> and she was brought to and the woman, the SS woman that I told you about, the young chick with the white blouse, she recognized my girlfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">She was a shoes sales girl in my girlfriend's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> and was fitting shoes on Trudy. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">So, she knew the family and she recognized her, and she was very kind to her, to Trudy, and I was Trudy's best girlfriend, so she was kind to me too. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">So, that's like an extra bit of privilege you pick up here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Q. You said you met your husband in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="521">You were allowed to socialize with the men? </span><span class="sentence" id="522">A. No. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">But you never asked permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">First of all my husband had more freedom of walking around since he was taking care of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and whatnot. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">No, we were not allowed to socialize but that didn't stop us from socializing. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">It was one of those unwritten laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">You go to work, boy meets girls, you know you don't have much to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">You get acquainted. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">These kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I think that's the hardest part for people who are not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to understand it, but it was a part of social life, if you wish. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">The encounters were very brief. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">You just looked through the barbed wire and waved, you know, that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Q. Were people able to have sexual relationships in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="534">A. I don't think so, but I'm sure too that was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">I would not like to put it that kind of thing, life wasn't so bad, no it wasn't that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Q. How long were you in ? </span><span class="sentence" id="537">A. I got to in '43 and was shipped out in '44, so I was about a year there. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Q.

So he transported you to the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="550">A. He went with us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and we were heading to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Q.

There was illness, the sickness, diarrhea, dysentery. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">As a matter of fact, we were the last transport to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Studthoff</span> , because once we left . </span><span class="sentence" id="681">So when we did get finally to , we were for two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">But I could not have survived Studthoff and I don't know anyone who did who was not sent out by some sheer luck before. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I'm not aware that there were people liberated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Studthoff</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Q. Did they give you food in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Studthoff</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="686">A. Very, very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">A thin slice if you weren't killed before, dirty water, so that to me it was probably the worst concentration camp ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Something puzzles you? </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Q. What was the effect of these conditions on the people who lived there? </span><span class="sentence" id="690">The inmates, did it bring out the worst in them? </span><span class="sentence" id="691">A. The very worst, except if you had some very dear close friends like I had my friend but usually they were all strangers. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I mean if you lie on those pieces of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> and you want to move, four other people have to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">You don't even know them, and they stink, and they're full of lice and -- Q. Did you have lice on you? </span><span class="sentence" id="694">A. Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Q. When you say it brings out the worst, what does that mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="696">A. It means I don't care about you. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">If I want to go to that <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and you're in front of me, I don't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">That kind of just to make it descriptive to you since you weren't there so other things would have a hard time visually it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Q. Stealing? </span><span class="sentence" id="700">A. Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Whatever you had, and you didn't have much and you could hear screams in the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Somebody attacks you. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Hunger is a terrible, terrible thing and can do to you no matter what your principles and morality is. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I mean hunger, I don't mean just being hungry, but hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">So, yes, again, I was fortunate to get out of and get to , which really was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="706">It was a part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> just like had different places where they send the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">We were a part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> and there was an <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span> , and that's where they needed some labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">They sent them the front, they needed people to produce work, so they just took some from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Studthoff</span> and that's where we got to and worked in an <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="709">It was not the normal set up of a lot of SS, there were no <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="710">There were places they could send us but that was not the set up. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">So, we worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">It was fairly clean and again you formed groups with most of the people you came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Studthoff</span> so you were already had a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">We already belonged together. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Same upbringing so to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Until the Americans -- Q. Wait, before we get to that, I want to hear a little bit more about , A. Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Q. You were able to see your husband there? </span><span class="sentence" id="717">A. Yes, he did not work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="718">He was an inside worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">He was a civil engineer by profession and he was older. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">He was more experienced and kind of out of respect, so he never worked in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , but he was freely communicating between the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Q. What were the general conditions? </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Were you in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Did you live in a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="724">A. Well, we were living in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , had the same wooden kind of pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Food was given out by the you know they had a set many rations of bread and soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">We kept it fairly clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">There was not that constant fear of SS storming in, so it was a much more relaxed atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And then we used to go work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , you did mingle with the Germans because you all were involved in producing ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">We were just additional help. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">So, you could move around. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">It wasn't that tight supervision by SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">That lasted until January '45 when the first wave of American bombers attacked and three quarters of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was bombed and fire and there was no work because the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was not destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">It was very careful bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was not attacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">The <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was not attacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Three quarters of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was in rubble. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">We were used to go out and help clean the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">That was the assignment. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">As a matter of fact, we never worked again in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> because if the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was almost ready to be workable, one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> came and dropped one bomb on the water supply and just got the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> out of circulation. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Q. So you were out on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="741">A. Well, there's more going out on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , cleaning the rubble and cleaning up the <span class="DLF">street</span> and waiting until we can go back to work and continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">So far they did not send us back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> because they did expect to have the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> working again. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">They never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And what would you like to know next? </span><span class="sentence" id="745">How did we get rid of the Germans? </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Q. Well, a question about this it seemed like it was a little bit easier than ee A. Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Q. Was there any sense of normalcy? </span><span class="sentence" id="748">A. When you mean normalcy --? </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Q. Did people have a social life, anything? </span><span class="sentence" id="750">A. No. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">It was still just a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and when night comes and you come back from the night shift then close the <span class="DLF">door</span> and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Q. The guards weren't as horrible? </span><span class="sentence" id="753">A. No, there wasn't that many guards so it like on a scale of comparison, that was <span class="NPIP">paradise</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Q. Now, when you were out cleaning up the rubble and cleaning up the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , did you come in contact with the local people? </span><span class="sentence" id="755">A. I didn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">Q. Oh, you didn't do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="757">A. I personally did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Q. So, what were you doing at this point? </span><span class="sentence" id="759">A. Mostly we were sometimes sitting in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Sometimes we would go to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and clean up the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Mostly men did the cleaning up. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Q. In the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> you were working with German civilians? </span><span class="sentence" id="763">A. Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">Q. Did you ever have any conversation about what was going on in the world? </span><span class="sentence" id="765">A. Politically? </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Q. The war? </span><span class="sentence" id="767">A. No. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Q. The Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="769">A. No. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Q. You just worked side by side? </span><span class="sentence" id="771">A. Yes, and one of the co-workers of mine, denounced me when I was just that short of being liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Q. You want to tell me about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="773">A. Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Well, as the war was getting closer and closer and closer, and that must have been April, now I'm back to April. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">From January to April it was off work, on work, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Americans were getting closer and if you want to know about , It was located on the and it had a historical meaning because that's what our friends were supposed to get together and throw arms around each other and declare peace for ever after. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">That was supposed to take place on the , and we were right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">On April 14, 16th something like that, the order came to get the Jews out of . </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Bring them towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="780">We cannot leave them for the Yankees. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">So, that's what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">they lined us all up and we were ready for our march towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="783">An SS woman comes into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and announces that the Americans are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">So whoever guarded us and wanted to go with us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , just took off, and here we were in front of the <span class="DLF">gates</span> without any SS the Americans are here, which really does mean you're free, and all we could do is stare at each other in complete disbelief. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">What the hell's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">What do you mean we're free. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">What's free? </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Until we realized that we really have no Germans watching over us. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">No SS, and what do you do with freedom? </span><span class="sentence" id="790">You turn right back and go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">We didn't know the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="792">We didn't know who was going to do what. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">That was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> so everybody went -- almost everybody went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and plundered the supplies and had a party and celebrated freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Except my husband, myself, my girlfriend and her boyfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">My husband said, "Hey, I did not see an American. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">I am not going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="797">So, we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="798">We marched <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , didn't know the location. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">The Germans had little <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> where they took care of their <span class="DLF">gardens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="800">We went there and found a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="801">Went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and sure enough Americans did not enter yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Later on we find out Eisenhower said "No, No, wait for the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">That's our agreement." </span><span class="sentence" id="804">So, the troops were there and they did not enter the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="805">The Germans pulled together and surrounded the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="806">Everyone out, told them to march to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="807">So we were some <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> in . </span><span class="sentence" id="808">We were there for about four or five days. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">The Germans were looking for the Jews because they knew that some Jews just escaped some <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they fished us out and we had some people who were not Jewish who worked for , the so called . </span><span class="sentence" id="810">They had different rules and regulations than we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">My husband was in very good standing with the Russian generals. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">So, when they fished us out and the girl said he's not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">So he didn't have to go with the Germans, and he dragged me and that was fine except that German meister I was working for said "She is Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">She worked for me." </span><span class="sentence" id="815">So, that was the end of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">My husband went with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">We were going towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and the night was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">It was shooting, storming. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">You could feel the woods just going through you so the next time we got into a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> , including the Germans because they were petrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">When the shooting stopped, everybody got up. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">We stayed in the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> and went in a different direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">We didn't know where we were, but went in a different direction, but 1t was such a bad night -- and if we saw a patrol they spoke to us German. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">We spoke to them German and we just continued and find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> again in one of those <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> that the Germans had. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">We stayed there for a while until the German population of that <span class="NPIP">place</span> came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">We could hear them coming, looking for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">We decided it's time to leave that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and find another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">We didn't where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Looked at the name of the <span class="DLF">street</span> --and again people were walking because some were caught in one part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , other ones were caught in a different part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> so we were just walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">We saw a name of a <span class="DLF">Street</span> and a direction and we decided that's where we're going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">I was shaking like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I really couldn't put a straight step, I was so petrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">This is what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">We just walked and walked and walked, and all of a sudden we see something which looks like a off a German patrol, but 1t was too late to turn back. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">So, we just boldly continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">The guy stopped us, leather jacket, not uniform, but leather jacket and he says where are you folks going, and we told him that we were going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">He said well the Germans left that <span class="BUILDING">establishment</span> last night and I found a wonderful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> which I'd like to take <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> broke, so if you're not in a terrible hurry could you help me carry that. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">I will give you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">I don't have much, but a little sugar if you help me carry that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Hey, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">We didn't tell him who we are, and he did not suspect. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Q. You weren't wearing your camp uniforms? </span><span class="sentence" id="842">A. We no longer had --what we had striped clothes like that and I had a kerchief. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">My husband had a regular suit which he prepared, and my girlfriend had a kerchief. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">We spoke fluent German. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">When he took us to his bombed out <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we helped him carry the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> he wanted, and we started talking a while and my husband and my friend said to him, hey there are so many other good things there. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">He said yes but how am I going to carry them. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">He said, okay we don't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">We'll stay here a night and help you tomorrow and it developed into a two week stay at his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="849">Things were a little touchy because he had a girlfriend who had a niece and she socialized with the German soldiers, and they came at night to visit, so we had conversations and they told me why don't I come to their <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , they had food left over. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">It became a little sticky. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And we hear the Americans entered the other side of ,and now we are divided by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="852">So, we decided to go over to the Americans, we found some German uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">I became -- my husband became a lieutenant I don't know, and my girlfriend some kind of ranking German official, and we decided to go as prisoners of war to the American Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">So, we found a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , made some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oars</span> , and hooked up with seven other German soldiers who are sick and tired of being treated like second hand citizens as they had no intentions of going to the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">When they found out that we are going over to the they were too happy to join us. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">So, we had seven German soldiers, two Jewish men and two Jewish girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">We took a trip around 6:00 at night and they had their revolvers all ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">If there is a Hitler they are going to shoot at them and they are going to shoot back and we had a white flag ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">We got over to the other side of the -- the first thing we did was push the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> back into the if the Americans get any brilliant ideas to send us back, we have no transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">We walked for a while with our white flag and there was no American in sight, but neither was anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">So, we just walked and walked and walked and finally come across two Americans who said hi and I said to my girlfriend how are we going to tell him that we are not German. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">They're Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">They speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">My girlfriend said, "Don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">I took four years of English in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , no problem." </span><span class="sentence" id="866">So anyway they are bringing us as prisoners of war and I said, "Bessi tell him, tell him." </span><span class="sentence" id="867">And she said nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">So, we were taken as prisoners of war to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">It was May 1. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Getting upstairs the two girls separate and the nine men downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I said wait a minute, <span class="BUILDING">American headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I am used to the Polish discipline, the German discipline, and here are the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Here are the guys sitting in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with their collars open, feet on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and <span class="BUILDING">American headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Now, we go through the process of telling them we're not Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">We sit down, show them, they don't know what the hell I'm talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">They never saw a prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">They never saw a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> inmate. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">It's a <span class="DLF">fighting line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="879">It's a fighting soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">It took I'd say about an hour because they brought every soldier speaking every language to try to communicate because we sounded so urgently trying to tell them something to finally someone who speaks Polish in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="881">I said well, they just went wild, literally wild. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">They didn't know what to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">I said the first thing you do is get those two guys out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> there because they are the real Germans, which they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">They all came upstairs and those soldiers really did not know what to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">They had a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but they were the fighting troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">They were still fighting the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">The war was not over. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">They put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="889">Found us a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you know lots of Nazis left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , established, brought us a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and then were bringing us everything which there <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> had. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">Every two minutes a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> load of food came on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I mean just talk about unbelievable happiness, and that's just a side story because when we were brought into that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with all that food, I remember what I said to myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">If you're ever liberated, you're going to be a human being right from minute one. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">So, I asked the American soldiers to give me a white table cloth and some dishes. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">The three of them were ready to kill me. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">They were starved and I said, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And then we set the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and had some candles and had our first meal as liberated people. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Q.

No, no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">I was amazed and probably happy for some people who had that belief and were going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> with their hand and eyes to God, it's his will. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">No, religion was of no importance to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">Q. And after the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">A. Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">Q. The other thing that we had talked about a little, do you think that the experiences were different as a woman or as a girl than they were for boys and men? </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">A. The experience maybe were not but how it affected the experiences of men or boys but for women there was a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">I think some of it 1s probably their upbringing of women always take care of someone, of something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">And even it the someone or something 1s just themselves, but it's just taking care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">Men, the majority was brought up that someone takes care of them because there was nobody to take care of them, they let themselves go much faster. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">Women bonding with other women because they need that camaraderie probably more than men did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">That's my observation, my explanation of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">So men when they lost their pride, they became nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">There was no support group, whereas lots of women did find support groups somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">Even the term was different, but just that whole idea of you have to be clean, you have to fight a little, you have to you know, and here is a little girl who needs help and so yes it depends on the woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">It just isn't a flat rule going for all womanhood, but it was a certain trend of doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">On the other hand, I saw women who went very willingly on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus train</span> , whatever, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> load, if their child was taken away from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">They didn't have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">I didn't see men doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">That doesn't mean they didn't, but I didn't see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">Q. What about the way you were treated? </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">Were you treated differently by the guards? </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">A. In certain respect for women? </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">Q. Or disrespect? </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">A. No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">Q. Was there an opportunity to women to use their sex to get favors? </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">A. Sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">I don't think there was the same opportunity for men because whatever they presented would not be very attractive to the SS women that have everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">There were opportunities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">Q. And that happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">A. I'm sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">Q. This wasn't a first hand experience of yours? </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">A. My first experience, no, but I know that it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">I don't like to prove my point by names and what not and having opinions about it or judgment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">Q. I'm just curious as to whether it went on and whether people were able to use that to their advantage? </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">A. Sometimes they did and sometimes people did and could not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">And it wasn't always possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">There were times that it was possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">The will to life was very strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">Q. When you talk about the bonding between women, the relationships that were formed that really helped sustain you, were some of those relationship sexual as well? </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">A. No, not that I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">It's not fair for me to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">Not that I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">Just loving someone and everytime I think of my girlfriend who stayed behind in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Studthoff</span> and lost her life --. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">Q. When you think back, and I'm sure you think back often, what images stick with you the most? </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">What haunts you the most. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">A. What hurts me the most I imagine the images of seeing people loaded on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to destination destruction and murder. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">I think that's probably -- the rest kind of disappears. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">So there was hunger so people were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">That hurts the most. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">There was just no way out of it except luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">Q. What sort of long term impact do you think this has had on you and on your life? </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">A. Long term impact? </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">Nightmares, waking up in sweat and fear until you realize there 1s nothing to fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">There are no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and SS and <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">chambers</span> and what not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">I think nightmares and thinking of all the ones who are no longer here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">It's not guilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">I did not trade their <span class="NPIP">places</span> and vice versus. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">It's just they were not as lucky as I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">Most of it is luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">It wasn't the armies helping to liberate the inmates of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">There was no <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> who really reached out to help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">So, it was luck, mostly, and if you call being at the right <span class="NPIP">place</span> at the right time, that's a part of luck, so I don't know really why I am alive and somebody isn't, but that is what the greatest impact is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">There was a very sad and those terms are all from this world, and I am referring to the other world, after the war long after the war, the past four years, my husband Hank and I traveled to the <span class="REGION">eastern European countries</span> and I did go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> and I did go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pornaty</span> and I did go to and I did go to and all those famous <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and what I saw was a quiet peaceful world with all those lives disappearing to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and burned and out of memory and nothing, just nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">That was painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">When I went to and I visited a very famous monument built by the of , a beautiful monument to the hundreds of people who were destroyed by the Germans, non-Jews, every half of minute the bells are ringing to remind people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">Well, that kind of hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">What happened to the six million Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">The same way the Russians were probably helping to destroy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">One crime doesn't justify another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">It's just the memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">Those were the bells every half a minute chimed and what happened to the six million Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">I can speak for them, that's all what's left for the world not to forget them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">That's sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">I can do the best I know how. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">I think not of six million, but the very dear ones I came across through my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">Q. Is there anything else you'd like to add? </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">A. I hope the world will not forget those people who died and don't consider every holocaust the same kind of holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">Death is the same, murder is the same, but the motives and the way it was done, the way it was done by civilized people, it's not the same as every holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">It was a group of people who's crime was to be Jews to burn and to disappear with a nod of the whole civilized world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">It's not the same holocaust and killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">Any war is horrible, but it was done by an intelligent, educated, bright people, to take a whole nation and say vermin we are going to make the earth clear of you and have everyone participate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">So, it's a different holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">Holocaust doesn't only mean kill or murder, and I think that's why the Jewish Holocaust 1s different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">And it should just make people aware that that can happen to any group of people by other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">Then the Jewish holocaust wouldn't be unique, theirs would be unique. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">It still would be unique, but what I'm saying is remember hatred does not justify that kind of human attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">And how do we teach people not to hate? </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">Q. Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Conclusion of Interview </span>
