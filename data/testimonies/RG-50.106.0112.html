<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  When did you change your name and why? </span><span class="sentence" id="1">October 25, 1998
ANSWER:  Changed my name as part of the naturalization in 1951, I believe, and the reason was that time I was married, my wife didn’t like this name, the all different kinds of pronunciations, and my brother already had changed his name to Wiener, w-i-e-n- e-r, and I told the judge at that time that the reason I’m changing my name to Wiener is because Zwienizki is very hard to pronounce, very hard to write. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">And just like a herring, where you cut off the top and the bottom, the tail and the [indecipherable] so I cut off the z and the icki and it remains wien. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">But I wanted a two syllable name so I made it Wiener.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  We’re going to ask about your immediate post-war experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I would like you to tell me how you learned that the war was over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  I learned it from newspapers and I also learned it from talking to people who had been in the Holocaust, who knew about the Holocaust [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  What exactly did you learn from talking to those people who were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  During the war, I was on — 1-in the beginning of the war I was still 1n contact with relatives of mine in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I wrote them letters and the letters came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And from the contents of the letters I knew that it was going worse — from worse to worse — from bad to worse, because they wrote this person is not here any more, he went on vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">What they meant by this of course was went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">After awhile I don’t hear from the people at all, letters came back censored, October 25, 1998 or no letters came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">This went on every year. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Every year I wrote a little article for myself about hoping that the war would end. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">We went out to the different organizations and — to find out if the war could be ended, but there wasn’t much response in that respect, and so it went on til the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">In 1945 the war ended, and many demonstrations were held and people talked about this and they [indecipherable] and they heard about this from other people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  You were in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">How did the American media present the news of the war and what had happened to the Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  It’s unfortunate that the media here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> didn’t write too much about it, a-and if they did, like the “New York Times” they wrote it on a— not ona main page, but wrote it on pages afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">It’s — the only time when they wrote the things on the first page was during Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And afterwards they didn’t write it on front of the pages. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I read the paper, of course, and while I read the paper, I also learned English more, and — and I can only say this, you see, that when the war started I was registered in class 4-D, which was clergy going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , because I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva</span> and they were exempt from actually joining the war, even though I tried to join the war and — but the only thing was at that time, either buy war bonds, or I even tried to join the war by being an air raid warden, but after awhile they told me, you cannot be an air raid warden, I was considered an enemy October 25, 1998 alien, despite the fact that I was Jewish in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and I always had to get permission even to travel, let’s say from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yonkers</span> , where I had a little <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yonkers</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  What was reaction of the Jewish community around you to the news that was coming out of Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  The Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">A-After the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="24">After the war, about 1945, 1940 si — 1946, I left the <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , the [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva Rabbinical college</span> , I left them. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I got semicha there and I talked about this, they tried to help Jews in Europe, they send out packages to them, they send out packages and then I tried to find people from my birthplace to whom I could talk and who maybe knew more about what happened at my particular <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And I found people, I found people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">There was some people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> by the name of Greenburg(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I talked to them what had happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I also talked about other people, I went to organizations, like — had a big demonstration in <span class="BUILDING">Madison Square Garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">They had the em — demonstrations all over, and bringing people e — over, and many people came over afterwards, but they had not actually been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nazi concentration camps</span> per se, they had, during the war they had gone from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and so forth to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> or into other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And they came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And then [indecipherable] and other people came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">October 25, 1998
QUESTION:  I have a couple questions about what you just said. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">You said you left the <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva</span> , you got semicha there. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Can you explain what that means?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Semicha means like ordination to be a rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">At that time, the rabbi at the <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva</span> was Rabbi Ruderman, who had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> just before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">In fact, his wife was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">KOénigsberg</span> , was <span class="REGION">east Prussia</span> , part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And it — and it was not — there were not too many people — during the war, of course, the number of students at the <span class="BUILDING">yeshiva</span> increased and after the war it went down. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">At the end of the war, especially, I tried to become a United States citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Already during the war I tried to become a United States citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">In 1943 was the first time I made an appeal to become an American citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Now at that time, the immigration policy was that you had to have first papers, and after first papers you have to wait five years and you can make an application to become a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">So, when I made my first application 1943, I was asked to come before a board in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , five different organizations, the navy, the — the war , the defense and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And it was — it was rejected because at that time the war was — looked very bad because the Nazis had been stopped at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> and it was very bad, so they didn’t want anyone to become a citizen unless they actually went to war. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And later on I made the application, think around 1950, though it might be earlier, with the FBI to go for translations. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So they said, if you want to make translation, we have to send you to October 25, 1998 <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , | didn't want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , so | stayed here. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">But they helped me also in — to get my second papers, and I got them 1n, as I said before, in 1951.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  And that’s when you became a citizen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  Then I became a United States citizen, and as I mentioned before, I changed my name at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And I was already married then, because we married in 19 — got married in 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  Is your wife also a survivor of the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  Yes, my wife was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and she moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Firth(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And they were living there and the — her father was a merchant, he had — they had a business, and — and of course like all people at that time, tried to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the Kristallnacht, which I consider the beginning of the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Everyone knew that it would not change any more and they had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Before that time, we also had tried to come out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but I don’t want to talk before that time, but only say that they finally, in 1939, that’s before the war, she came out with the Kindertransport, children’s transport to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And their parents also came out, because they had some relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I had also tried to come out with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , but just on the date when I received the permission to come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , they stopped it. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">October 25, 1998
QUESTION:  I wanted to go back to something you said a few moments ago, about being at magison — <span class="BUILDING">Madison Square Garden</span> —
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  — with [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Can you tell me about that event?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  It was a big crowd in <span class="BUILDING">Madison Square Garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">They made many [indecipherable] meetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But, as I understand it now, you see, and as I read in the newspaper and so forth, there were always requests of people to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">They — at — at that time, in order to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , [indecipherable] you needed a — what’s called a certificate — zertifickat. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And there were only a certain number of zertifikats available per year for people from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because a number of zertifikats had been set in nine [indecipherable] that time, and at that time the — the — the — the — I mean, the type of population in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was different than it was in 1940 and 1950. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So, many people got certificates but they were only dated for two or three years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And who wanted to wait two or three years? </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We didn’t want to wait two or three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">We didn’t have an American certificate, even though I know from my records, and my mother, that she had — my father had applied to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> already in the 20’s, but my mother didn’t want to go because she had all her family in — 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So that’s why we stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">October 25, 1998
QUESTION:  I'd like you as an eyewitness, to tell me what was going on in that protest at madis — <span class="BUILDING">Madison Square Garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">If you could describe the scene and what was said, and — and the feelings that the people had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  I don’t know any more exactly what went on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I can only tell you it was a very big meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">You see, the <span class="BUILDING">Madison Square Garden</span> has a very big <span class="NPIP">place</span> and it was filled up to capacity. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And there were many people who spoke about it, what happened in — in — in — 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and what could be done and they wanted to — they wanted to influence the American government to do something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">In that respect, I mean a little bit to the side, when I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">yeshiva</span> , there was a young man, he was young at that time, who came every week, every Thursday to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">yeshiva</span> and from there he went on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to discuss with cabinet ministers to let Jews out. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And his name was Michael Trist(ph), and the person he talked to that was discussing, Moshe Sherer, which recently passed away, became the president of the Agudath(ph) [indecipherable] organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">But every week they came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And some of the <span class="BUILDING">yeshivas</span> and some of other organizations made it, but it was a very tough time because the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was interested — and it is not against the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was interested to win the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">If we win the war, then everything will change. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So we cannot bomb the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And they heard the person, Jacob Rosenheim, I have his October 25, 1998 book here, and I heard him speak many times, who le — sent letters, and I have the copies of the letters which he sent to Roosevelt and other people to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Only one person was successful to a certain extent, a limited extent and it was Ruth Gruber, I don’t know if you heard of her, who arranged with Secretary Ickes and Morgenstern(ph) and so forth, they arranged that thousand — that they permit a thousand Jews to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span> , one of my family, and we also went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">In — that’s in the — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span> is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake Erie</span> , I think, it’s in the state of New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So they did very many things, so the people came over and they were protesting and they were writing and they were talking to in-influential people. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">But it was not the mood at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">It was just — in fact, they never felt that anything bad happened to the Jews, and it could be changed, until Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I think by Kristallnacht it changed, because that was the first time that Roosevelt called his ambassador from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> away and talked to him about what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  When the war was over, and you said you had read articles, not on the front page, about what had happened to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I would like to get a sense from you of what the Jewish community in the — in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , religious or secular, whatever you can share with me, what was the reaction of the Jewish community and — and was there much said by the Jewish community? </span><span class="sentence" id="93">October 25, 1998
QUESTION:  Many think that, and it was not always positive, unfortunately, because when I came and the whole family came in, already before the war, in 1939 to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> we came, before we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> [indecipherable] <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , there were in — in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> there were mone — mostly older people and they could not believe it that it was as bad as it really was, even if we told it to them, you see, they could not believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And we were considered even when we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , refugees, an-and it — an-and considered refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">We were called greenhorns. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">It’s completely different now, when the Russian Jews came over, and they were accepted as [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">We were — we be — came there with only four dollars from — from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which we could take out, four dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">This was 10 marks at that time, 10 marks was four dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And even when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">yeshiva</span> I[ had to canvas that — that we put clothing, other things like this, doctors, or medical servicing and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We were not considered actually as it was, as bad as it really was. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">They did not think it was as bad as it really was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  How long did it take for — for you or the people around you to grasp the full extent of the genocide, just how many people were killed? </span><span class="sentence" id="103">How long did it take for that information to come across? </span><span class="sentence" id="104">October 25, 1998
ANSWER:  You must know that everything which was done by the Nazis was done secretly. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And that’s why people still denied if afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And that’s also why many people didn’t know about it until very much — because, as I mentioned before, in the beginning we did — we did receive some correspondence, but afterwards we didn’t receive correspondence. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Everything went — I don’t know how it came over here [indecipherable] channels, small radios, because they had no television here. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">It came out slowly after the war, it came out, even so set — so far that last year when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I heard certain things which I didn't even know happened during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">You see, even now, 50 years later, 60 years later you see, there are certain things which had never been publicized and which only come out now. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">It’s unfortunate, you see, when so much in secrecy that people couldn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">It was unbelievable, it’s beyond belief what happened there, that a — such a thing in a —a highly civilized, scientific <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> should happen like this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  How closely did you follow the Nuremberg trials?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  At that time there was already television, I think, 1946 and we tried to see — look at the — look at the television, find out what ha — what was going to happen and we saw other people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">But in my impression, I mean the impression of most people was [indecipherable] that these people were so brainwashed, or crazy, or whatever you call this, you see, saying that I had nothing to do with it because I followed October 25, 1998 orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Same thing was when they killed my mother also, they said, we followed orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But they did not have their own mind, they just said they followed orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Of course, the world knew by that time that they could have done something because they had power and they had all the authority to do what they wanted to do and they didn’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And not only this, the worst thing of it, that they in- intimidated the whole population to do this — to go in the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">That no one actually acted freely on his own free will.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  Did you follow the U.N. vote on the partition of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  Yes, we followed it very closely. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">It was in November and we followed the vote and it took some time to find that the majority vote came out about <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">That was going on for a long time, because it actually started long before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">In 1936 with the British, you see, were not too happy and were not too much in favor of — of it at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And they even — many people died because they tried to go there by force to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">They couldn’t land, they got sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Crete</span> and other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But before the — this, we saw them, that finally came through. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We were very much ap — surprised, especially that <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> voted for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But of course no Arabs, they voted for it and they never acknowledged it. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And to this date, no one blames them for anything, but they really do because they never voted for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">For them it doesn’t exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">October 25, 1998
QUESTION:  Let’s take a break and see if we can get — stop that background noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">All right, we're back now and I had been asking you about the partition of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and I wanted to get a sense of you — from you, of what was going on here in the Jewish community with respect to the partition and the birth of the state of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  The entire Jewish community here, as far as I know and I saw, was very much interested in what was going to happen, because many Jews had already gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time, and they did not feel safe in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and they did not know what would happen, the 21 Arab states would be poised to — to break <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and not to have peace with them, you see, even though the Jewish community in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and I know that, offered any person, whatever nationality, whatever sex, whatever religion, to stay there and they would live in peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">But there was so much hatred and unfortunately we still have hatred in the world, that they said no, don’t stay there, go out, because they will kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">They did not have in mind to kill you, just now [indecipherable] in mind to kill anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Not as, number one, not [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And they went out and they made the concen — they made these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camps</span> , in which they are existing today, and the U.N. supported it. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I went to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.N.</span> when the U.N. was, at that time meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">They were meeting already before 1945, the U.N. went in, and what would happen there, they saw people standing — people standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and there was — this is — was — o-other people in October 25, 1998 there, beca — all the people wanted peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">All the — they want to live in peace with other people too, but they just couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">As I mentioned many times, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> I mentioned it too, the most pious person cannot live in peace if the wicked neighbor doesn’t want it. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">That’s one German citation, that the Germans made themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Schiller(ph) made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">His poem. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So we were very much afraid that we would not have peace, but we all very much wanted peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  Did you every consider making aliyah and going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , sp — [indecipherable] at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  I know many of my family went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , but I can tell you that already ye- years before that, in 1933, when Hitler came to power, already in that ti — at that time they had what they called Hasharah. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">It means preparation for. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And I participated in one of such groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">However, like all the Jews, my mother especially thought that things were changed and the neighbors, our neighbors, our non-Jewish neighbor [indecipherable] things were changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And who knows what it 1s starting in a new life and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I wanted to go there, we learned already Hebrew at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">But at that moment when — when this happened, the partition happened in 1948, at that time I was in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and my — my father was in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and he did not have too much — he did not make too much of an effort at that time to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , even though we had family in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time, and I received October 25, 1998 [indecipherable] from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , but at that time it was not settled yet [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  After the birth of the state, there was the — the war, and there have been subsequent wars. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I-I wanted add — to ask you to share in the insights or any thoughts you had during these conflicts, particularly with your life experience, knowing what war can be, and knowing fear as a Jew, I was wondering if you had any insights that you could share about <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ’s wars.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  First I want to say that the Jewish people were always against war. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We want to try to settle everything by peace as much as possible, even if it’s [indecipherable] unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">But I remember one instance, I think it was the — the war — the Six Day War in 1967, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And at that time I was — I had a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and I went to a convention in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">We had — and my father’s family was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , and at that convention we had a meeting and at that meeting there was a great British journalist, I think Lady jo — James, I don’t remember her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Anyhow, there was a vote. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Who votes for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and — that they should win or that they should be — should be peace and who votes against it. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Every person voted with <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> that isra — that <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> should have peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Only one person voted no. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And they asked this one person why no, they said, there should never be a complete, 100 percent vote. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">There should always be one — besides, then they asked the question, October 25, 1998 what can we do in order to make peace here? </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Well, there were all different answers and one person, this Lady James gave a very interesting answer, she said, we should build a <span class="DLF">wall</span> , like they have the <span class="DLF">China wall</span> — <span class="DLF">Chinese wall</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> and the other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They had another <span class="DLF">wall</span> [indecipherable] <span class="DLF">Berlin wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So we make a — at that time they were all interested in making peace by building <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So they had the intention, this lady says, you make a <span class="DLF">wall</span> between the Israelis and the Arabs. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Of course it never happened, but that was the psychology and the — the ideas of the people at that time, you see that they might think — that they think by making <span class="DLF">walls</span> , you can make peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Just like during the war, you see, when the French made the <span class="DLF">Maginot line</span> , they thought with a <span class="DLF">wall</span> they can [indecipherable] the peace and the Nazis just walk around. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And that was an interesting idea she had. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Then of course there were the other wars [indecipherable] but when the — the Six Day War, you know, when they suddenly saw that the Jews were winning and there was a euphoria and they went in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> with big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed sheets</span> and you collected money, everything was okay, but unfortunately, this a mistake for the Jewish people, they did not see what they could have done at that time, if they had done it at that time, we wouldn’t have trouble now. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">For instance, at that time the whole west thing, everything was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">At that time they started to call it the West Bank. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Before they didn’t call it even the West Bank. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">It was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transjordania</span> , it [indecipherable] October 25, 1998 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jordania</span> was — was separated between the east, the west and th-the whole thing about <span class="REGION">West Bank</span> and <span class="REGION">East Bank</span> and who knows what? </span><span class="sentence" id="179">These terms wouldn’t came up there — the other words which were going on between <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , there was always a trouble — they were always afraid the Jews would win. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And they did win in some [indecipherable] at that time when the [indecipherable] and they captured all of the <span class="REGION">Sinai peninsula</span> and they even had Arafat surrounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">They did not do anything with him, they let them all go [indecipherable] I don’t know if the others would have done this if they had cir-circled — encircled the Jewish people and so forth, they would not let one person le — go out alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">But that’s what the Jewish mentality is. [</span><span class="sentence" id="183">indecipherable] they don’t understand this here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  The comment that you just made with respect to the <span class="REGION">Sinai</span> and the encirclement of the — that’s the *56 war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  It was the <span class="DLF">Suez canal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And I want to say only one thing, it could have been peace, and this was — and I remember this, you know, Golda Meier, who was the prime minister at that time, she made peace with Sadat. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Cause even Sadat had fought the Jews, but they made peace on the basis, and that’s why she [indecipherable] she said we both have grandchildren and we don’t want our grandchildren to live through war. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">You see, so — so therefore there is some point where you can bring people together. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">But you can only bring them together — they October 25, 1998 mentioned <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> too, if you learn from the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">We have [indecipherable] grandchildren who — in the future, so have to learn from that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  How closely did you follow the Eichmann trial?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  At that time again, we followed it by radio and by television and we were very much surprised that they found him, because he did not identify himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Only afterwards they found out about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And then it was ORT and television and a-all, and we heard all the reports which were done. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">It’s unfortunate again that one person [indecipherable] he should not have been executed, but — well, I don’t know, you see, because he executed thousands and hundred thousands of people, he is one person. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">He was guilty, that’s all [indecipherable] but again, to the last minute, he denied that he was responsible. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">He denied his responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">People don’t want to be responsible. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I did by — by orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">But that was his order, because he was one of the three or four people at the Wannsee conference who made the decision of the final solution.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">QUESTION:  Did you feel justice was done?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  I think there was done justice, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Even though we say — even though the Jewish religion they say God 1s the final judge, you know, God is the final judge, but — and justice will come eventually and it did come eventually because the war ended and Hitler did not achieve what he wanted to achieve, so he was the final October 25, 1998 judge, but at that moment it was in the hands of the <span class="BUILDING">human court</span> , with the majority of mankind at that time, because everyone was involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So therefore, I think there was justice done, to that extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">QUESTION:  We’re going to pause, and I’m going to flip the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">One moment. [</span><span class="sentence" id="207">break]
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Jacob Wiener. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">This is tape number one, side B. And I wanted to now continue in the 60’s, you had just told me about the Eichmann trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">The 1960’s were very turbulent in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and I would like some insight from you on how you reacted to some of what was going on around you. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Specifically, let’s start with the Civil Rights movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Do you have any thoughts on that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  I never felt any animosity, so to say, to anyone who was not Jewish or any other kind of color, because even in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I had a black person, at that time they were called Negroes, in my class, and he came from a former German colony in <span class="REGION">east Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So I — I always tried to reconcile people and to try to — to understand other people’s views. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Now when this happened with the Civil Rights movement, of course when I was working in the department of Social Services in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , we had also many people who were different colors, Orientals and other people of October 25, 1998 different colors and I was always very good with them, and never had any problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So, besides this, I remember when they had this march to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Selma</span> there was one Jewish person who was killed, Schwerner(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And Schwerner(ph), we knew his father, who had a wig fam — a — a business of making wigs, sheitel, in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And so we knew about this, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Again you see, here you see that there were Jewish people who, as some could say, with what happens to other people and not just saying it like you know, many times people say yeah, we have sympathy, but they deserve it. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">No, not that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">A-And try to have and try to see what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">So we had the sympathy with them also, and th — because — because a number of Jews, especially Jews, are very sympathetic to all kinds of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">They have this kind, what you call this [indecipherable] hearts. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Emotion with other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">It doesn’t necessarily mean we — we — we have to leave our religion or our whatever we believe in, but we also acknowledge what others believe in, we don’t fight them because of they’re — they are different in certain respects.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">QUESTION:  You mentioned that in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> you had a classmate who was from <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit about what it was like to have him in the class and what the reaction of the other students was to this individual? </span><span class="sentence" id="228">October 25, 1998
ANSWER:  In the beginning there was really no difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Under the Weimar republic, I mean before Hitler came to power, they made no difference between them and them, even though Weimar republic said every person has a right to live his way. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">This person was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I don’t know what happened to him afterwards, but I’m quite sure that when Hitler came to power, he had gone back by that time and I don’t know what happened afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">But I only know that during this time, 1t was a — because it was an organization in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> during the Weimar republic which was called verhein(ph), means a-an assembly, a group, for Germans in the <span class="REGION">foreign countries</span> , especially in the <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , where the Germans were the bordering countries, here was such kind of an organization and they wanted everyone already in the Weimar republic, they wanted everyone to join this organization and to work for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">In other words, they already wanted at that time to include them into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">They were not hiding like Hitler did, to conquer them and make them part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but they were just like supporting them, because they were living at the outskirts of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  This <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> had gone to war with <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> and then again with <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I was wondering if you had any insights that you could share about what was — what it was like for you to watch this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> now go to war. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">October 25, 1998
ANSWER:  The unfortunate thing 1s that after the World War II, which is now of course, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> [indecipherable], it means war of distraction, because that was the whole purpose, more so than winning the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">At —- more — many more wars happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Like you say, the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> , the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> and now even other wars in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> and all over the world [indecipherable] situation in <span class="REGION">Africa</span> , all these different things which happened afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">But that was the — and age — I mean, the 60’s were some kind of — it was a rebellion, it was rebellion of the youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And I saw it myself because there was it — in my department, when the commissioner gave a talk, a group of people came, stopped him from talking and sat in front of him — sat in front of him, you see, so that he couldn't talk any more, and talked against him. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">No respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I mean, that was — that is actually the beginning of making peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">The first — the first thing about peace, when you have to re — respect for each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And honor what other people say, that’s a real democracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">This was what Freud calls civil disobedience. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">That means they — they wanted to show their own force, their own selfishness, their own pride by saying I know more than you do. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">That happens with — I mean, it happened in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> too, that children — and my wife knows about this, that the children many times will see — accuse teacher of something which they want to be the boss [indecipherable] be in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">You see, if people don’t work together with each other, you see, that’s what I always try to October 25, 1998 do, as I mentioned before, with the black people. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">With other people, if they don’t accept this and the respect to other people — respect other people and — and listen to other people, at least listen to them, you see, then we cannot have any peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">So I was always — I didn’t really understand the anti-war movement at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Of course, we shouldn’t have a war which there is no purpose to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">But the government itself, you see, didn’t have a key purpose of what they really wanted to do, and therefore it’s — it’s no wonder that the people themselves didn’t know what to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  I'd like to ask you about — you mentioned children and — your wife and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">What kinds of things did you tell children about your experiences before you came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  I told the children then and I’m telling the children now — and I wrote about this, I’m telling the children to grow up in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where you don’t know what’s going to happen to you, they make laws against th-the Jews, they make law against other things, the first thing 1s you have to know what you want to do, you have to know yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">You start with knowing yourself and then you will either — you cannot be everything, everybody [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So therefore I say if you want to be a Jew, you have to know what it means to be a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">If you want to be someone else, you have to know what — what it means to be someone else. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">But you have to know what you want to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Because you cannot talk to other people if you don’t have a point of October 25, 1998 view of your own. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">So it — when I wrote the children and I was many asked to talk about what it means to grow up in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and I was many times asked, what do you think about things which are going on in this world, I say, we cannot have all the answers, and I studied psychology, we cannot meet on the — always have all the answers, but we have to know one thing, that we have to have one point of view and sometimes we don’t know the an — we don’t always know the answer, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">But then we have to have a belief, a faith [indecipherable] I have the faith in God, and finally he will make the final decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I don’t know, we make — made decisions and it would not happen that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">We had — we — we always thought, you see, that if we make this kind of treaty, well have peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">No peace came though. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">No, we — we don’t always know the decision, but finally the decision were made [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Just like I know that when Chamberlain before the war, by the mun — Munich conference came back with an umbrella and said, we have thousand years of peace, that what he thought, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">But I don’t know if he ever believed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">If you say something and you don’t believe it [indecipherable] tell the truth, then nothing will come out of it, that’s what I say. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">That’s why I told the children, you have to learn something about yourself and you have to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you have to — education is the most important, now we all know it in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> too, education is the more important. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">It’s — it’s more important than learning about war October 25, 1998 [indecipherable] education, because if you haven’t educated you don’t know how to — what kind of decision to make and where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And it also finalize — it also sensitizes a person to what it means, how to live with other people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  I wanted to ask you about some of your writings. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And specifically if you had some favorite themes that you revisit in your writing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  Favorite themes? </span><span class="sentence" id="277">When I write certain stories and so on, I make people beli — I bring out — I like to, I intend to, I don’t know if I’m always successful, I intend to find out in — in — and — and impress upon them that, as I said before, we have to know what we want. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And — and I know there are two types of people who came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , two types of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Don’t want to be [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">You see, the one type of people who came out and said, if God lets this happen, where is God? </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And another type of people came out and they said, I cannot believe anyone and I only believe in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So just two opposites. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And we see this here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> nowadays, we see that many what we call bali- chuva(ph), that means people who returned to Jewish [indecipherable] many thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And we see on the other hand that people say, I don’t want to believe that. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And I wrote about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And — and — and I say, if — if a person doesn’t at least have one goal or one motive by which to go, he gets lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And many people committed suicide during the war, afterwards, because they — they didn’t know what was going October 25, 1998 to happen and they couldn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">From the Jewish point of view, it is an [indecipherable] sin to commit suicide, because we have — we are not the masters of our ow life, and that’s why suicide is forbidden because our life was given by God and therefore we cannot take it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">He — unless He takes it away, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">But — but that’s the story.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="335">ANSWER:  Yeah, I sometimes get people who talk to me and who’ ve said they cannot talk to their par — to their children because their children are different. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Some children do not want to hear about what happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">But I can tell you one thing, which I know from my work as — on psychology and in the department of Social Services, that I have found that it’s very difficult, often, not always, to talk to the children, and it’s easier to talk to grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And I found this out in three respects. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Number one I found it out when I was working with child abuse, what was [indecipherable], that the children of — who were abused didn’t like to talk to their child — to their parents because they didn’t want to make them feel ashamed or responsible. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">But the grandchildren want to know, they’re a little bit further removed. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Number two, I found out we had some relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and my — my October 25, 1998 brother once went to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and he spoke to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And then some grandchildren of ours, from my — my — my uncle’s grandchildren came and they wanted to know about Communism and things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">The children didn’t talk about Communism to their parents, the — on why and what, but the grandchildren did. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Then I also have this here — this — I worked with AAA, alcoholic anonymous, so the children don’t want to talk about it to their parents, because they don’t want to picture their parents as alcoholics. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">But the grandchildren want to get into [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And the same 1s also true with the Holocaust experience, that most of the time you see, the children don’t want to hear about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">They hear so much about it, it’s too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">But the grandchildren are free, more free and they want to hear about it and they — many times, an-and that’s why, for instance my — my wife didn’t want to write any book or anything like this for her children. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Yeah, now she writes it for her children [indecipherable] the grandchildren. [</span><span class="sentence" id="350">indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I think eventually they will hear it, you see, but it takes a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">QUESTION:  Id like to ask you some questions about your volunteer work at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And Id like to know specifically what do you do at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">We moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Silver Spring</span> in 1988. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">When I came here I had a job already right away with the Montgomery county to give a course on the search for October 25, 1998 identity by the famous Victor Frankl. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">It’s an omo — 1-it’s called — Victor Frankl. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And then I also tried — I — at that time the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> was just forming, it had an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on L or <span class="DLF">M street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> and I was going there and talking to Miss Morgenstern and additional people of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , I was talking to them about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">But they were not organized yet, so I just let it go. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Then I — I didn’t want to take a job there, I just wanted to see if anything could be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I was talking to them to — to the one 1n charge of the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And then I started to become a regular volunteer when it opened up in 1993. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Even before that I was already a volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And in the first year I was also on the volunteer advisory board. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">One time I — I was a little bit — for a little while I was chairman, but then [indecipherable] two years, then you have to go out and I didn’t want to — because you can only stay at wa — at — on the advisory board for two years, then you have to interrupt one or two years, but I didn’t want to do it any more, no time. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">So what happened is now I’m doing three things at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Number one a visitor representative, which means on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> doing all the different things which should be done, which are necessary on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , about information and passes, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevators</span> , all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Number two, I’m with the Fannie Mae organization [indecipherable] about taking groups, leading groups around, young childrens in their teens, junior and high school children. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And then after talking to them for two hours or so leading them October 25, 1998 [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Then number te — three, I’m in the <span class="BUILDING">speakers’ bureau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And <span class="BUILDING">speakers’ bureau</span> , they have different person now, John Minnick. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I went and I talked to the — different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I also talk — I was asked by other organizations, by the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic University</span> and by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Meade</span> talked 1-in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">York</span> , <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">White Port</span> , <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="374">indecipherable] remember what the difference is, and talked [indecipherable] you see, I just talked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">But I only talked for a few minutes, let’s say for 20 minutes, 30 minutes the most, 20 minutes and then they ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">But as we see, I showed them the list and when I talked at this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , I was surprised that after the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was finished, after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was finished, people came and they stayed and they asked more questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">That’s what I’m doing now and I also — I also brought to their attention that it was 60 years now after the Holocaust and to do something about it, they didn’t want to do anything in the beginning, but now it seems to be [indecipherable] doing something about it, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">So I just got to all the different people [indecipherable] will also give a luncheon and I think it’s a luncheon [indecipherable] the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in January next year, about certain experiences in [indecipherable] Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">There are many things in Kristallnacht which I didn’t know and I have the documents there and I have some books which I found in the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> only last week.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  What special insights and talents do you bring to your work at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="381">October 25, 1998
ANSWER:  I don’t know if there’s any talent, I don’t know 1s there any insight. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">I think it’s just the willingness to — people should know certain things and — which to — which is very hard to get to it—1-—a different way, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">You have to have your contact, you have to know what other people want. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">The only thing is like — like you say in social work [indecipherable] you see, the most important thing of a person is be able to listen, listen, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And so I try to listen to the other people, I don’t always talk [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">But I mean, in general it’s — it’s the attention, it-it-it’s mainly to listen to other people, to understand what they mean by that, and if not you ask them. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And it’s — it’s the most important, I think, and people should ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">You cannot always have the answers because there are more questions than answers. [</span><span class="sentence" id="389">indecipherable] it’s more question than answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">But it also says [indecipherable] the Bible says, and too in the Talmud that you don’t ask questions, you — you cannot learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">So you see, you have to ask the questions and when you see something, you ask the question, why is this happening, why is this not happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And not to be so bland and disregard what’s going on around you, that don’t have anything to do with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">You cannot live in this world, I tell them many times, as one person. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">You can only live with — you must have other people to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">What would you do if you would be only one person? </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Who is going to bake? </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Who is going to [indecipherable] Who is going to — to bring you from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to October 25, 1998 another, transportation and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">So we need all our other people too. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Everyone has a job in this world, and we must all work together. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And we must all believe that we are not the final [indecipherable] and we’ll be judged eventually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">QUESTION:  Can you tell me some of your special experiences or special moments that you ’ve had at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  I—I-—TI once —I was working in the — in — on the — in — in the information section [indecipherable] two times I had people coming over and tell me — tell me something about this, so I told them — and they came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I — because they needed someone to speak German to them, so they called me over, so I spoke to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">So inter — and was very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">This one person, she was a student in history, and the other one was in — working in the <span class="BUILDING">German embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">It just so happened that they wrote me, they knew that I would be in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they telephoned me from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunis</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> and they excused themselves as they could not come. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">See, I don’t like to start conver — correspondence with others, you see, but they wrote me. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">So that was one instance and they wanted to see me and they wrote me, by the name — the name of Schroeder, that I think they are related to the president — president of wer — <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">So [indecipherable] works in the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="410">So then I had, another time I had the woman coming over and she said she was very depressed and she said, we were living in the zargabeit(ph), the October 25, 1998 Zweibriicken and it’s between <span class="DLF">border</span> , <span class="DLF">French border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And at that time in 1936 — °36? </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">They had the plevisute(ph) whether they want to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">So they decided to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because Hitler made so much propaganda there. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">But she said, we were always good friends with Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">My fath — my — my father used to deal with Jews and my — and we always had good relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And then afterwards, when we joined <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , then they called over my husband — her husband and they asked him what did he do with the Jews, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Why do you still keep contact with the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I didn’t understand exactly what she said, if he committed suicide or what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">But anyhow, after she came back from the — going through the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , she came back to me and she said to me, I don’t want to see all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">In other words, she said, I don’t want to remember all this because it gives bad memories back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">So people come over sometimes and they tell you certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">There are many other things, but you hear any other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">You sometimes see people who you haven’t seen for years. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Sometimes people come — I met people from <span class="REGION">South America</span> who — who met — who knew someone of ma — my cousin who lives in <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">You see, 1-it — all kinds of experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">It’s very interesting there if you are on — on the — with the public, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="428">That’s why I went with the public, and I could have done translations upstairs if I wanted to, but this is more interesting for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">October 25, 1998
QUESTION:  Have their been any special moments where your experiences as a refugee and survivor have — have had an impact on the students who come in through the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  Yes, I mean, when I talk to them and they want to hear more about it and — and some people call me back and there is some impact, but I — I don’t know actually how much impact it is, I only in — I only can say that when we finish the rounds, you know, I sometimes ask people to write out the comment — the comment cards, you see, and — and they write out the comment cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">They write out certain things that gave them more insight and they would like to hear more about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">It has some insight, but directly I cannot point to any particular theme, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">There are — it certainly makes an impact on them, and the people come — to most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">To most of them, I cannot say to all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Especially children who, I would say who are more than 15 years old, because if they are less than 15 years old, even though the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> says 11 years can come, you have different types of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Some have — are very intelligent [indecipherable] some only become intelligent at 15, it’s all different grades.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">QUESTION:  There has been a resurgence of interest in the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">You have been in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> since before the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">In your experience, what do you think has accounted for this resurgence in interest? </span><span class="sentence" id="440">October 25, 1998
ANSWER:  It — it took a long time to — people here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and all over really found interest in the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">In the beginning no one wanted to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And I know the people who come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> [indecipherable] don’t want to — to buy German goods, and things of this sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">After the years go by, people can look a little bit more in unbiased [indecipherable] peace and rest about what happened with us, and people want to know more about their past in hitl — in Hitler’s time. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">You see, everyone had one had to rate — write a — what is called a family tree. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> I think it came about when Haley wrote his book on roots and people want to know who’s really my forefather, who are really my people before me. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And I think this had some influence here that people want to know more about it and the children want to know more about their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">It could be an — and they learn a little bit about it in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , more than before. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">It’s unfortunate that in Maryland it’s not compulsory to teach the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">But I know they have five or six states, like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> is one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And maybe [indecipherable] to the education [indecipherable] where it is compulsory to talk about the Holocaust, not only in five or six <span class="DLF">lines</span> like they have in the social studies book, much more about this an-and learn about things, see. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">How people should live with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Human history. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And that’s why very important, you see that people like [indecipherable] we talk about the Holocaust, you see, we try to learn about it, we like to make October 25, 1998 people aware about what happened and what can happen if the Holocaust and especially the second ge-generation, they should know about that [indecipherable] they doing a good job.

QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Jacob Wiener. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">This is tape number two, side A. And I had been asking you about the resurgence of interest in the Holocaust, and I wonder if you think that the — the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> itself has had some role in the resurgence of interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">If the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> itself had some role in the resurgence [inaudible]
ANSWER:  Okay, you also asked me about how I feel about certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I already told the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> there are certain things which I don’t feel are correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">For instance, certain people, you see, certain people who had the experience and so forth, should be used to do some research in certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> and — and I found that — that the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> is more interested in certain facts, not — they would hear more about the emotions from other people, you see [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Of course, when you have emotions, you may not always be neutral, but there is no person in this world who is a neutral, you cannot be neutral in th — in — in th — in your mind [indecipherable] where it says you can be neutral in facts, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">So for instance, October 25, 1998 I [indecipherable] to them that they are — they’re preparing people who have studied from books and every book has a certain bias. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Because you can have 10 books and you have 10 certain points of view in 10 certain books. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">You cannot be full of bias. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Of course, the survivor, or someone [indecipherable] also has certain biases, because what he went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">But his personal bias is — is actually what he learned during the Holocaust, I mean what the experience in the Holocaust, what I experienced or others experienced during the Holocaust, so [indecipherable] so therefore I say, if you’d send someone out to visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> for instant, you know, many survivors don’t like to do this, because they want — don’t want to have a second experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">But the people who go there with a professional degree and book knowledge, they may not know which questions to ask, proper questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And that’s why I said to them many times that — that I feel you should at least send one person also from the — from those Holocaust people, you see, the sur — survivors and they should bring out their — their emotions, wha — how they feel about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I feel about certain things, you see, feeling is not [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And that’s one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And then — then, like I, you see, I don’t feel too comfortable in maybe saying everything which is there, but you cannot always — you don’t know who the other person is, how the other person would take it, if I tell them from my own inner heart, you see, how I feel about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">So I don’t honestly know that, you see, October 25, 1998 but I don’t want to insult the person on — and things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">But — but let’s say when I lead the groups around, you see, I tell them how I feel about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And I tell the other people who I — how I feel about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And I don’t always know if this 1s the right way to say or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">You should always say your — your feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">If you have very strong feelings about it, like I had about — as I mentioned to you before, about people can come out and they say they don’t believe in God any more, you see, now I have the strong feelings about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">But — and na — once happened when I — when someone has invited me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , psychologist, a friend of mine, he asked me to talk about what happened during Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I couldn’t say it, because it — I was — it was too much for me, I couldn’t say it. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I do cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I couldn’t say it. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So there are certain times, in certain instances which made the greater impression on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Makes a great impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I didn't vi — didn’t want to talk about the Holocaust, what happened to me, but after awhile I said to myself, the world must know, you see, like the book says. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And, so therefore I said I would [indecipherable] about it, and so not everyone may like it, but that’s what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I hope only that we gonna have this hatred any more and this kind of terrorism, and this kind of anti-Semitism, because I experienced anti-Semitism very early in <span class="BUILDING">class</span> , 1n — in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">QUESTION:  Did you experience anti-Semitism in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> after the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="486">October 25, 1998
ANSWER:  No, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">You see, there is always some subtle anti-Semitism which, if a Jewish person advances or so, there’s always some anti-semi — Semitism 1n the — and why does he do this, and — and why does he deserve this, and why doesn’t he — there is always some anti-Semitism, but I cannot at this point have to think about it, find out special incidents. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">There are always certain incidences when you see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I mean, I don’t know if this 1s anti-Semitism, because that the Jews were considered enemy aliens during the war, I don’t know if that’s anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">So I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">But, that we were considered like refugees and looked down, that was hard to get a job, you see, at that time it was hard to get a job if you are not pure in your language and you have an accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">In <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> it’s not — no longer that way, used to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">So, I mean, you couldn’t get a job in the very beginning, you know [indecipherable] some anti-Semitism, I think, but — or it’s just [indecipherable] against foreigners, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">But whenever someone leaves a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , comes to a different <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , he’s not immediately accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Takes a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Now we accept people much quicker, when the Jews come in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">QUESTION:  Do you see the interest in Nazism from the skinheads and the other neo-Nazi groups as a— as a parallel to what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">ANSWER:  They could develop into such a thing, I think, because they are very adamant about hating people and — and — and wherever there’s hate, there is the possibility October 25, 1998 that it develops into the same a-as before. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I know this because the thought already is, before Hitler, feeling at the time, I saw the — that — that youngsters, you see, called you names [indecipherable] that’s always possibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And — and in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , at least now, they tried to outlaw anti-Semitism, you see, here too, but you cannot completely outlaw it because you never know what really is in the person’s heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">There are some people who [indecipherable] anti-Semitism. [</span><span class="sentence" id="503">indecipherable] you see in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> too, sometimes they see the teacher [indecipherable] people, especially when you go to non-Jewish schools. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And they [indecipherable] have the books really, what kind of books they read and [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">But it’s not on the old — in the old [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I like to — if I see something like this, I’d like to address it head on, you see, like I do many times, you see, even when the Nazis invaded our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , I asked them right away, don’t — don’t want to hide from them, I just want to ask them, why do you have this? </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Some like — someone asked me, do you have any — do — don’t you — do you — y-you don’t like me because I’m not formal, I’m not religious, or so, like this, they ask me this questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I say no, I would like you to see and be religious, but I — I — it’s up to you, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">You have the choice, you see, and therefore I — I’m not refusing, you know, everything, that is nothing but my point of view is, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">That’s what the most important, like said before, you have to have a point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">October 25, 1998
QUESTION:  What are the accomplishments that you feel the most proud of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">ANSWER:  Most important is that when I came here, you see, I — I found something in — in the <span class="DLF">education field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And I like the <span class="DLF">education field</span> because you can influence the children and people and other people and — and I work in that <span class="DLF">field</span> with — when I was — I had different job, I — I founded a — a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> in th — the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> there, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Catskill mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">I — I worked with the <span class="BUILDING">girls’ schools</span> , and I helped bring girls over from — from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> on a student visa and I helped <span class="BUILDING">banking institution</span> in 1956, the <span class="BUILDING">children’s home</span> for the ke — the re-retarded and emotionally disturbed children, which 1s still exists in [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And I — I learned with other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">So I think that’s a — another thing, and I wrote a few things, you see, which [indecipherable] and learn from if they want to, and — and I think eh — but could have done more. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">But we cannot do all everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">We can only do a few things, a few things and everyone does his own and we live together in peace and harmony. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And to be well and healthy, that’s the most important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">QUESTION:  What would you yet like to accomplish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">ANSWER:  I’m writing this book, I hope to finish it, because they always ask me, when will you finish it, how — how far are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I — I’m lazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I just cannot get to it all the time because I have many other things, I have here [indecipherable] chaplain, I go there October 25, 1998 — there — I give classes here and there and there, so I have to cut down on this, to do one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Too many things are not good to do, even if I move it up and — I —I want to finish this book, I hope, and write a little bit more about the experience, and talk to people, that’s all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">QUESTION:  Tell me about the book that you’re working on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">ANSWER:  The book 1s actually an autobiography, but it’s not only an autobiography, also it’s something about history in it, because — I mentioned this in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , I said you only want historians to travel overseas, yeah, I said — I said, I’m also a historian because I — I studied history and languages, you know, to see, that’s why I n — know a little bit about every language, but not the whole language. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Now, towards the end is this, I — I want it to be maybe part of a textbook, so that’s why I wrote also a little bit of history in there, you see how it came about, and how the Nazis invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">What you hear mostly nowadays when peoples talk is their experience in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , and — which unfortunately is — 1s a very important part of their life — lives, but I think it — I— what people don’t know so much, and that’s what I am talking to them about in the — for the speakers’ bureau I mentioned it, about how was it possible that Nazism developed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and what brought it about, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">The antecedents, what happened before, you see, and ho — what it means to grow up in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , that’s my topic, more or less, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Not so much — and it October 25, 1998 wasn’t in the conversation unfortunately you see, but I understand it was a terrible experience, but here’s what I want to — to write about in this book, and I don’t have a name for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">But I also want to tell them, you see, that I, among the [indecipherable] I wrote about it, every person has to see in this life, miracles happen. [</span><span class="sentence" id="532">indecipherable] a whole list of miracles that happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I wouldn’t be here, the miracles. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">So I feel it’s important that a person understands themselves and understands that he is not the guide of the [indecipherable] you know, no some —next day something happens, you get sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">But you have to pray and you have to hope, see. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">That actually 1-is what I believe and I would like others to believe it too, but I can’t make them believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">But I said to them, you see, you can learn a little bit from me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">QUESTION:  You mentioned some miracles that happened to you in Europe, getting out of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">What miracles happened to you in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">ANSWER:  In this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , first of all, when we came to — I have to start here, coming to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="541">It happened many miracles in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , I — it would be too long to talk about everything, I’d rather [indecipherable] a miracle happened that we wanted to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> and we were told by the government you come — go to <span class="REGION">Saskatchewan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And my father had a cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">A miracle happened that we — we met some people at the travelers’ aid and they found out for us and we stayed in October 25, 1998 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">We didn’t think we would. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">A miracle happened that I want to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and there was no way for me, I didn’t know how. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">But one day we found a newspaper where some people who have gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with me in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they on there and I wrote to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> and I got an affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And the next miracle was, when I got American affidavit I needed permission to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , | didn’t think I would get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Had special meeting with the consul [indecipherable] and I had no money and I got money from the [indecipherable] Jewish American Aid Society, I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Never thought I would come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> to an <span class="BUILDING">institution</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And I never thought I would — I would stay there five years or six years. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Stayed there five, six years, til I got [indecipherable] in the organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Then I didn’t think I would get a job afterwards, I got a job [indecipherable] and so forth, so all kinds of — and didn’t think I would ever become a citizen [indecipherable] and about getting married and children and all the other things coming afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">All miracles. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">The whole story of miracles, and I wrote si — I wrote that the miracle of Hanukkah, the miracle of proof of my own stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Hanukkah miracles [indecipherable] miracles.</span></p>

ANSWER:  We will never be able to cover everything, but I just want to say that, as I mentioned before, if you have hatred in your heart, you — you won’t get very far and you might only hurt yourself and other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And since I was a social worker at one time, I still am, that’s number one. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Number two 1s, you have to have your own opinion what you want to live with and — and if you feel comfortable, then you should do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And especially if you’re Jewish you should — you should know what it means to be a Jew and — and you should teach your children, you see, and sometimes your children don’t ask many things, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">You should play to their — an age when they ask, and when they ask you should answer them as much as you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And I hope that the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> will make it possible — makes it possible for people to learn about that and — an-and gives everyone a chance to experience what other people experienced, but they should also give some opportunity for people who experience it to — to do more in this <span class="REGION">area</span> if they want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I want to thank you, that’s all.</span></p>
