<p><span class="sentence" id="959">ANSWER:  In 1987 I was like a piece of stone, I didn't want to talk about the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">I didn't want no questions asked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">I couldn't show affection to my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">I was messed up pretty bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">So, I couldn't show affection. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">I was like a piece of stone. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">In 1987, I had to go in for open heart surgery, and after my open heart surgery, my whole personality changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">I guess I got another chance at life or got a new life and I became very sentimental, very soft. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">I started to show affection to my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">I started to show affection to my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">I always loved my wife and my children, but I couldn't show because anything that you got close to in the war, you lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">So, I was afraid to show my affection, because God forbid I would lose them. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">My open surgery changed my whole personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">I became so affectionate with my kids, everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">Even now when somebody says something, I watch a movie, I start to cry like a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Before it never bothered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">In 1992, my wife was diagnosed with cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">They gave her three months to live, tops if she survived. </span><span

class="sentence" id="979">I showed her how much I loved her. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">She knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">I didn't leave her for a minute and she was terminally ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">She couldn't walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">She was in terrible agony. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">She started with 25 milligrams of morphine, she went up to 275 and that didn't help her. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">But I guess God wanted me to survive to show her how much I loved her. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">She was a fantastic human being, a terrific mother a beautiful wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">She was so sick and she didn't want to hurt her parents because her parents were still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">Her father is 88 and her mother was 85. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">But the cancer and the will to survive is unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">They gave her three months, and she fought for eleven months. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">She wouldn't give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">She denied that she had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">She said I'm going to be beat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">I got so affectionate to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">I got so close and she showed me her love which was unbelievable and she kept on fighting the cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">She wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> with the cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">She was getting radiation and chemotherapy. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">She wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="999">She couldn't walk, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheel chair</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">The whole time she was in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheel chair</span> on pain killers, she was getting radiation in <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="1002">She wanted me to be happy I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">She fought an unbelievable battle and we have a friend of ours her husband passed away 2 1/2 years ago and my wife used to tell me I should call , maybe she wants to go out with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Her mother also had cancer and she said call and see if she wants to go to support group with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And I didn't want it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">I loved my wife, but she insisted I had to call her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">I said okay I'm going to call the Jewish support group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">My wife was very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">She used to call her and used to call her and used to talk for hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">As I was saying she was starting at 25 milligrams of morphine any treatment that she could have and she suffered so from the treatment it was unbearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">She used to get such pains in her legs that you could see by the fingers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">The pain was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">The only thing my own invention I used to take hot compresses, boiling hot <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">compresses</span> , turkish style, I used to wrap them on the legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">I used to put on a plastic bad, I remember from Europe yet, and that's the only thing that used to relieve her pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">I used to get up at night and I knew she was in pain, and I said you got any pain, she says no, I said I know you got pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">She said no I don't want to bother you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">And she went to doctor and she went to the last chemotherapy and she got so sick she was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and they gave her the chemotherapy and she got blisters in her mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">She couldn't swallow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">She couldn't even take a drink of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">Her face was completely blown up, her lips, the flesh was showing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">It was such a pity, and the doctor says there is nothing more I can do for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">So, she went to another doctor and she went to him and he said you want to hear the truth and she said yes I want to hear the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">He said, there's nothing more I can do for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">We came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she says to me, I don't want to live no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">That's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">And all of a sudden the pain got so bad I called the doctor and he raised the morphine from 75 to 175 two days later he raised it another 100 milligrams, 275 milligrams and I didn't want to give it to her, I didn't know what the morphine was going to do to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">She couldn't take the pain no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">I said let's put you in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> maybe they can help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">She says okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">I didn't even want to take her to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> because this way I fear that she thinks I'm throwing her away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">I didn't want to take her to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">I took her to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and she stayed there a couple of days and the pain, she was getting injections of morphine close to 275 and she needed medication and she was getting patches and the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> didn't have it and I had to buy my own medication for that, and
