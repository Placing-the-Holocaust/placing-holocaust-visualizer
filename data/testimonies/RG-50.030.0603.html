<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  What I noticed firstwell, first of all, I didn't start <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when I should have, when I turned six. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I remember my grandmother rented out a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to a boarder. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">It was the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> I remember in that scene where my father is coming into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Well, she eventually had to rent out that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and the lady must have been a Nazi because she gave me a coin for my sixth birthday, and she said, "Soon we'll have a new picture on the coins." </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And she was very triumphant; you know, she was gloating over this. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And then I remember the most frightening thing, when the doorbell rang one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And my grandmother was a little hard of hearing, she didn't hear, and I kept telling her, "Oma, the <span class="DLF">door</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And she went to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and these two men in Nazi uniform came in with the high, shiny black boots and the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And they passed through the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where I was, and one of them patted me on the head and said something. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And I have no idea what he said, I justI was terrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And they went into the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with my grandmother and shut the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And I heard a lot of talking and then they all came out, and my grandmother came back from closing the <span class="DLF">front door</span> and she had tears running down her face. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And she said, 'We have to move out, we're not allowed to live here anymore." </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And then one dayI don't know how many days after thiswe went to a <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> , my grandmother and I, and I believe she got a stay, you know, she didn't have to move immediately, because we stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">But I remember the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> , the big picture of Hitler and the flags and so on, which I found very frightening, but she seemed relieved, and I'm sure it's because she got this stay, she didn't have to leave immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Was your mother already in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">My mothermy mother took me to a friend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , because my parents thought in the first days I would be safer staying with friends of theirs who were outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And they also had children. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So I stayed there a few days, and my mother, when she put me to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> that first night and she said to be very good and brave and she would see me as soon as possible, that she was leaving.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  And you're talking about moving to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> right now? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">In the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  It was outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And then after a few days my father said I could come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and my grandmother came and got me and took me back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  Was there anything specific happening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> at that time that
ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I think they were just unsure. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">This wasmy mother left in April of '38, so in March '38 is when the Germans actually came in 1n person, and then she left almost immediately, in April. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">My mother was very blond and blueeyed and she looked, if anything, Slovak, not Jewish, if you're going by stereotype.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  So my father pushed her on the <span class="DLF">Aryan line</span> when it was time to get her papers stamped. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And he said, "These are still Austrians, they'll look at you and they won't ask for proof." </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And sure enough, that's what happened, they just stamped, instead of standing in the long, long <span class="DLF">Jewish line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So she left and thenshe left me with these friends, and then it couldn't have been longtwo, three daysmy father brought me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I think they were just unsure of what would happen in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  So that probably happened shortly after the Anschluss, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Beforeactually before the Anschluss. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It was in between the marchin (ph) because when she left, the man who stamped her papers told my mother, "Be sure to go to the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> and vote about the Anschluss." </span><span class="sentence" id="114">He was thinking, Good Aryan, she'll vote yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  For the Anschluss, yes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  So it was part of, you know, this interim period. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And then I have a memory that must have been around Kristallnacht, because I remember comingwalking with my grandmother, and we passed where my <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And as I said, it was run by a Jewish organization, and I saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> pulling away with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> and broken things on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and broken glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So I think that probably was around that time maybe, Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And then the next thing, my father took me to the parkI think it was right before he was going to leaveand at first he had thought he would take me along but then
QUESTION:  To <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  No, to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And then I think he got a little bit more realistic, that a sixyearold trying to climb illegally over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> wouldn't work too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So that was when he tried to teach me a few words of English, thinking my mother is more likely to be able to get me to join her. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">My parents realized immediately that there was not a hope if they didn't each go out as quickly as possible and then try and bring me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So my mother, in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , was trying to get papers for me to join her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  She got you on the Kindertransport?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  That was before theas soon as she left she started trying. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And there was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> that even signed a paper that she had paid for my schooling but the people, the officials, didn't believe it because how could a domestic get up enough money to pay for a year of <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  So they didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">But it was my grandmother who found out about the Kindertransport. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I have no idea how, but she did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  Did she talk to you about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">All Iremember is she toldshe showed me: "I have sewn your mother's address into your coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">If anything happens, you know that"she told me, "You're going to meet your mother, your mother is going to be there to meet you, and here's her address 1n your coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">If anything" you know, "if you get lost or anything, this is where your mother is." </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And she packedI don't remember her packing the suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">All I know 1s I have to leave my doll behind; she didn't pack my doll.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  I'm sure that was really upsetting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  It was. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I was only six and the doll would have been a comfort. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But I had a bag with my lunch, the food for the trip, and we left at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And although I was usually an obedient child, I clung to her and screamed on top of my lungs when they tried to take me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">The families were not allowed to go on the <span class="DLF">platforms</span> so we were in this big <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span> , it was nighttime, and they tried tothe women who were organizing the transport tried to leave me with the other children, and I just held onto my grandmother and screamed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  So you didn't want to go, did you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  My grandmother was the lastyou know, this was my bastion, my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and everybody went away and now she's sending me goodness knows where. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I think I didn't really believe that my motherI don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And so
QUESTION:  Did you dol mean, your mother left to Englandit was still very early, you were very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I mean, did youdid you remember your mother very well when you were going on the trip?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  Oh, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">It was only a few months different. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I left in December of '38; she left in April of '38.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  Were you closer with your grandma or with your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  My mother went out to work so my grandmother watched me all day, you know, I was with her all day. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">But emotionally, 1t was my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I mean, always it was my mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  So did they succeed eventually in separating you from your grandmother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Physically, I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">They took my fingers off her skirt, and as soon, you know, as I was out of sight of my grandmother I think I just resigned myself: This 1s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I stood with the other children waiting to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="163">Interview interrupted when person enters <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">|

<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  Were they upset or that mostly was just regular?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  I can't reallyI think I was too selfabsorbed toyou know, I justI don't even remember really looking around me at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">The next thing I remember, I was in a <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">There were four of us in the <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> , and I think we were all rather among the smaller ones there, all four of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And it was nighttime, so one of the women who escorted us put some blankets on the flooryou know how those <span class="INT_SPACE">compartments</span>
