<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  Well, that’s a good question, because as I graduate the <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , I also had to have -- had to serve three months in the

class="sentence" id="218">Those were the initial orders given, and of course we, as a military unit, we were prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Suddenly, over -- it was a weekend, Saturday to Sunday, when the invasion started. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And of course my commanding officer knew that the -- I -- a-as a matter of fact, I think I was the only Jew in the

I will never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">When I arrived at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , I was in uniform, in the Austrian uniform, military uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">When I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , got off, got out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , I couldn’t believe that I -- I was in -- in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where I not only was born, but raised and went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span

class="sentence" id="228">Everybody had either a flag or an armband, Nazi armband. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Flags all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , which never occurred during my lifetime in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> , go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I noticed of course at -- at that time, at th -- at this particular moment I didn’t know that they were all Jews who were down on their knees scrubbing the <span

the next day on Monday, and when he got -- got there, there were two Gestapo men waiting in front of his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And they introduced themselves and said that they were here to transfer the business over to the <span class="BUILDING">German banks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And as a matter of fact 1t was -- I think it was like a contract, that he would be safe under their control until September the first of 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And they were more or less watching every move he made during that period, and in the meantime, my -- my mother contacted my family in the -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and started procedure, getting an affidavit to get me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">At that time we also unfortunately found out that as far as I’m concerned, I could leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> without any problems as a -- soon as I got my visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">But my parents, unfortunately, my father was under the Russian quota and my mother came under the Polish quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Both of those quotas were -- were closed, and they just could not get a visa to get to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , so naturally -- we had contacts in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and other <span class="NPIP">places</span> and my parents were able to arrange -- leave here now to go first to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">But going back to -- to myself, on Monday morning I got back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , to my <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and believe me or not, I got into my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and I couldn’t find any of the -- my personal belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And, as a matter of fact, the whole regiment couldn’t find anything of their own belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And what we found out is August 12, 2002 the German -- Germans moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">As a matter of fact when I arrived in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , I saw the Germans drilling on -- on -- on the <span class="DLF">field</span> , just like it was

<p><span class="sentence" id="250">ANSWER:  As I said, when I came back into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , I couldn’t find my personal belongings and we later found out that the Germans just took over and threw everything down into the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">So we all had to scramble and find our things. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I eventually did. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I immediately contacted my commanding officer about the situation, that my parents a-are going to get me out as quickly as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And so he said don’t worry about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Of course, I also explained to my commanding officer that I couldn’t leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> until I get my mili -- mil -- military passport, because those are requirements to get the visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So he said don’t worry about it, I'll August 12, 2002 take care of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I was in the Austrian uniform for almost two weeks -- over two weeks, as a matter of fact, which helped me considerably, moving around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> without any fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And so the day when the commanding officer had the military passport for me, he called me in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and said, now here’s the passport, but I won’t give it to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I said, why won’t you give it? </span><span class="sentence" id="260">He said, because I want to make sure that you’re gonna deposit th -- in the <span class="BUILDING">American embassy</span> , where it belongs. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I said, well then, let -- take it out, I’m going to the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">He said, no, I’m going to call a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> for you, put you in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> and -- and you- you take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Which I did, and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> directly from the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and deposited a passport in the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> and then went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Of course, after that I had to take off my military uniform because I was not in the military any more, I was discharged; although I was, up until 1956, I was considered a reserve officer in the Austrian army, wa -- at that time of course, in the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And as a matter of fact, I still have my military passport with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And so a -- twice -- we -- we lived in a -- an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> and [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> near the American -- well, wi -- <span class="BUILDING">American embassy</span> as a m -- as a matter of fact, a new <span class="BUILDING">American embassy</span> after the war is located within a <span class="DLF">block</span> , walking distance from where I used to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And w -- our concierge was very cognizant of the situation and always informed us whenever the Gestapo came by to inquire about August 12, 2002 the Jewish residents, to notify us that they were here. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And so whenever that happened, my parents of course were safe because my father had the contract with the Germans to be in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> until September the first, but for me, I had to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And just went to the far -- far suburbs of do -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and stayed there for about a week, then I came back again. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Well, finally I received my visa in June of 1938 and packed everything up, wh-what I wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And of course I could not leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> with more than eight dollars in my pocket to go to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And of course my father, being in a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> , he arranged prior, long prior, my -- before my departure, to have money picked up in -- in twa -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> when I arrived there from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , which I did, was very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Of course, everything -- before I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , my passage was completely paid and taken care of from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And of course I was concerned about my parents, what -- what will happen to them, but luckily they were -- they got the visa to Yugoslavia. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">It’s only for about I think six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And then they traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> they went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And in the meantime, my uncle who had -- who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , and he had contacts with the State department, and arrangements were made that my parents take a -- buy a round trip ticket -- of course sh -- that’s the only thing they could buy, a round trip ticket to the <span class="REGION">West Indies</span> , a cruise to the <span class="REGION">West Indies</span> and arrive in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And so naturally my August 12, 2002 parents bought s-some cruise tickets in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and they left <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cruise ship</span> in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And they cruised and of -- when they arrived in -- in ha -- in Santiago de Cuba, the port, the representative of the <span class="BUILDING">American embassy</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> that greeted them and took them off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And my parents stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> for -- until April of 1941, when they finally got their visa to enter the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">So that is my story.</span></p>

go out of their way to help us or talk to us, give us service and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">But I also must say that I left in °38 and I came back in ’71, that the <span

first and then my daughter and her husband and their three daughters joined us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> when they came up from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And we spent eight days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and [| took them through the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and I took them to the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> where I used to go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">But -- this 1s the nice thing about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> is -- compared to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , they’d rather destroy and build new in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> they -- they’re trying to -- to keep it the way it is and maintain it properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">But anyway, [indecipherable] <span

took her to the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> where I was sitting for my -- my sec -- my second grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And as a matter of fact 1t was a Saturday afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Of course, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> are still there Saturday -- Saturday morning, half d -- half day school on Saturday, so we just arrived there when the children left, and I was waiting until they are all out, and then I walked in with my family and took them into the <span class="BUILDING">school building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And in the <span class="INT_SPACE">classroom</span> , one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">classroom</span> the teacher was still there and August 12, 2002 says, I told her, but she just couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">She couldn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And I took her to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where we used to live and of course that was a really high moment in my life, because I -- I noticed the children in my family were so interested in seeing where I grew up. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And -- and the third time was in 1990. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">We took a talk tour to ma -- <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> and we wound up in <span

<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and then I would up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And in those -- as a matter of fact, I didn’t mention that in the second visit to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> with my family, I- that was in -- in ninet -- in 1990 and that was a complete turnaround as far as being a visitor there. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">People seemed to be very polite, very helpful, very pleasant and it was almost like being 1n any other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , really. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">But if course, in the back of -- of our head there was still -- still the past, naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And bif -- the third time, just a few years ago, and it was the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I enjoyed it while I was there for about three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And that’s it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="763">QUESTION:  I had asked you before, and Ill -- Pl ask you this again, maybe I can get a -- a different perspective. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">During the war you didn’t realize the full impact of the genocide. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">When did you realize just what you had escaped, what you -- you know, by leaving when you did? </span><span class="sentence" id="766">When did you get the full impact of the genocide? </span><span class="sentence" id="767">August 12, 2002
