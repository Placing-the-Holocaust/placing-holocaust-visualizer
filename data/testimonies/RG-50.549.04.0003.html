ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Were you named after someone who has been murdered during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  What does that mean to you, and what do you know about these people? </span><span class="sentence" id="3">Can you bring them to life a little bit? </span><span class="sentence" id="4">December 7, 2000
ANSWER:  Well, it’s hard to bring them to life, because I really never met them. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">But my first name is Esther, which is my father’s mother’s name. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And I don’t know a lot about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I know a lot more about my father, and how he survived the war, but not so much about the personality of the mother, or the father, for that matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">My middle name is Cylia. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">That’s after my mother’s sister Cylia. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I know a little bit about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I know all the good qualities about her, and my mother seemed to adore her. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I don’t know a lot about her otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I actually -- my kids are named after survivors as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And we did one other thing for our children. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">All their names equal 18, all the letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">They have 18 letters in their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And 18 is a very special number in the Jewish religion, because it means chai, it means life. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So we try to continue that on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  Okay, we’ll talk about your children a little bit later. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I would like to now go back to you as a very small child, and to see the first memories of stories, of bits of stories that you now know were related to the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  I -- I can’t tell you the age, because it was always there. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">My -- and you can tell a little bit when they started, because I could see when they started with my older son. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My bedtime stories were probably Holocaust stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">My father would sing me Yiddish songs, I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">My mother didn’t read to me at night, my -- it was my father’s -- not job, but that’s what he liked to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">It -- it just didn’t start, it was always there, they always talked about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Their friends were always December 7, 2000 Holocaust survivors, they didn't integrate into the American society. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">So that was always the topic of conversation, I can’t tell you when it started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  Let’s -- 1-1if you can -- I mean, I know it’s really difficult, and especially 1f it started very early, to remember, but are there bits of stories that you remember that came up at what occasions, how did they talk about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Is there anything that sort of comes to mind, that gives an impression of what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So their father sang to you, what -- what -- what else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Oh, he would tell me the -- I mean, that’s what he would tell me, he would tell me about Hitler, and -- and -- and children being killed in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I think he learned actually to temper his stories as he got older. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">He would tell me, you know, the children’s fats were made into soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">He would tell me that -- you know, his -- his n- nieces and nephews were killed and they were my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">He would say that -- it would even start with food. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I was a very fat child, and they were very proud of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">They were proud that I was fat because they had enough food to give me and children were starving in the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">That I remember very distinctly, I was not allowed to leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> without finishing all the food, because the children in the Holocaust were s - would starve, and I should appreciate all that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  They would say that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">December 7, 2000
QUESTION:  How did -- how did -- how did you feel, I mean what was your reaction? </span><span class="sentence" id="45">How young were you, roughly, that -- I mean, when the father told you, for instance, about the --
ANSWER:  I could be three. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I mean, I was very young when they would s -- tell me these stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">You know, I just remember the stories were always there. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">How, you know, he lived in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">My mother did not tell me stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">My mother didn’t tell me very much at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">It was always my father’s stories, how he survived, and how they met, and how all the kids were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Not my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">My mother would cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">She would -- she would start to tell me these stories, and then she would cry, and I didn't want her to cry so I’d always change the subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I mean, I never let her tell the stories, but --
QUESTION:  Did -- did your father make them into stories for children? </span><span class="sentence" id="56">How -- how do --
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  -- you remember them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  No, they were not made for stories for children. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">They were as gruesome as he could remember them. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">He would tell me -- he didn’t go through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , so he didn’t tell me those kind of stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">He told me how his father was killed in front of him, how his sisters were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I knew the story about my grandfather, I can’t tell you what age I -- I knew that he tried to -- my mother’s father, how he escaped, and how he tried to come back and find her. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I -- I can’t tell you when these started, but I-I always had these stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">December 7, 2000
QUESTION:  Do you remember how you felt when you -- when you heard that? </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I mean, wa -- was it -- was it a -- was it fear, distance, curiosity, wha -- how did it make you feel? </span><span class="sentence" id="66">What was your response to --
ANSWER:  Well, you’ve got to understand something, 1s that one, I was an only child, so I had no one to bounce it off except my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Again, my parents really only associated with Holocaust survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I didn't know another world. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">It was the only world that I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I was not a giggly kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I never was a giggly kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">The kids used to play with -- I ne -- I didn’t play with dolls very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I played with maybe trolls, later on in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Make-believe was very hard for me, because I guess I had a taste of reality -- harsh reality first. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I wa -- I drew a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  What di --
ANSWER:  I drew animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I drew animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I could relate to animals better than I could relate to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I always drew animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I have actually even difficulty, probably, drawing people. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Again, how did I know it affected me? </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Only because later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">When you’re growing up and it -- you really don’t know how it affects you. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I just thought this was the way in -- in that regard how everybody was. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">It affected me in other ways that I didn’t have a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">It affected me that, you know, I saw my friends with grandparents and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">But the actual stories? </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I never heard Winnie the Pooh. [ </span><span class="sentence" id="90">never heard any of these, Snow White. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I didn't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Did you have friends as -- as a young -- as a younger child? </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Did you -- December 7, 2000
ANSWER:  I didn’t have a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I had some friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I had -- I had some girlfriends, but not a lot, because in a sense, almost like my older one, I was a little -- I call my youngest kid a little old man, and I probably was a little old woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I just couldn’t relate to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I couldn’t understand the -- the sparkling dresses and the fancy hair and clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">My parents weren’t into that, she never took me to <span class="BUILDING">malls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">She never did any of these things, so I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Did I resent it? </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Only a little, when I was older I resented it, not when I was young.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  Did you make -- did you make a connection to those stories that were told and to the songs sung, to your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="103">When -- when did that happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I mean, did it -- were they s-sort of difficult to deal with stories [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Well, you gotta understand that they were never told to me as stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I didn’t have to take a fairy tale and try to then say oh, I’m going to transfer this fairy tale to something that happened in real life. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">These were presented as real life stories, that really happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So I knew it was my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I knew it -- that everything belonged to them, that I was part of that history. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And they kept telling me I was part of that history. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">That I should be a good Jew, I guess, because I am a -- because I was born, it was their fight against Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I mean, I had to maintain that. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">That is something that I was brought up constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And I do tell my kids that, a -- a little bit, is that because I sur -- I -- I was born, and I survived a Jew, and I maintain it that I am victory over Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So this was something that I grew up, all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">December 7, 2000

ANSWER:  Well, you gotta understand, everybody has a dysfunctional family as far as I’m concerned, there is no perfect <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I mean, you watch on TV, that’s where you make your comparisons. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And you always wanted to be like the family on TV, not so much like your friend’s family, but the family on TV. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Cause they always complained about their parents, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I didn’t have a close home life. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">My mother -- I was closer to my mother than my father, only cause my father wasn’t <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">My father is a very driven man. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Probably is why he survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But also, he was an immigrant in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and he had to prove himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So he would get up at 10 o’clock in the morning, which December 7, 2000 means I’m already in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">He would come back from meetings at 10 o’clock at night, and when I was young I was already in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">He loved to listen to Yiddish mo -- music, which is not something that I liked. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And on the weekends they would go a lot with their friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I was a tagalong only because they didn’t have a babysitter, and they would speak Polish, which 1s a language that I never learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So I had to create my own world. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I mean, I used to have dinner with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">She’d u -- have the -- she loves the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So either she had music or news in the background. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And she’s very political oriented. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And so she would always talk all about all the political situations and I had to always be a-abreast about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And that would be our pul -- our - our life. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">My parents didn’t really integrate with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Maybe it’s part of the inte -- European culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">But we didn’t do -- we went on vacations. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">We’d travel a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">We didn’t do a lot as a family, not that I can recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">My mother, again, she wouldn’t take me shopping. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">She laughs at me when I say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Oh well, you know, I took you on these trips instead of shopping. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We didn’t do the normal family stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">My mother liked to read, and that’s what she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I don’t recall us ever engaging 1n board games. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I don’t ever a -- we nev -- it was as if they were tired of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And I couldn’t relate. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I mean, again, that’s also fantasy. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">You know, board games and playing with a little kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And they didn’t know how to deal with it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  It -- it -- try to ex -- to try to -- for listeners who haven’t heard -- who haven’t heard the interview with your parents, and from your perspective as a -- as a younger person, because maybe that has changed over the years, how did you see your mother and how did you see your father in the earlier years? </span><span class="sentence" id="166">How -- how were they to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="167">How did you see them as persons?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  My mother was reality, my father was fantasy. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">My mother is not a ha -- in my perception is not a happy woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">In a sense kind of bitter, but down to earth. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I was never showered with compliments. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">She may disagree with me, but that’s my perception. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I -- I always liked to draw and she always felt that that was beneath her as an occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I was accepted to <span class="BUILDING">art school</span> , she was very angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">She said, as a vocation, not a -- as an advocation, not vocation. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">She wanted me to be a doctor, it was it, black and white, you’re a doctor or you’re -- or you’re a failure. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">She called me a failure when I was in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  Do you know why --
ANSWER:  Yeah, oh -- December 7, 2000
QUESTION:  -- it was so important for her to -- that you become a doctor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  -- yes, and she explained that to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">She said that a doctor -- and again, this is her perception because she was a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">A doctor can take their skills and go from one <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to another and start again. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And if I wasn’t a doctor I wouldn’t have those transferable skills. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And that’s why it was so important, even though math was never a strong point. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And it was just not a subject that I excelled in. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I was always on the debating team, I was on the speech team. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">It was very interesting, I mean, when I was young, that’s where I lean. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And you know, yet I agreed to be a pre-med student the freshman year of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And then I realized it -- I loved taking care of people, but I couldn’t get through the chemistry and the -- the physics and the trigonometry to get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I mean, if it was just lab work, I got A’s in biology lab work and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So that’s the freshman year of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> she called me a failure. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But when you have no other siblings, y-you have to achieve all the goals that your parent want. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And that’s what they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I mean, they didn’t see me as almost a person, but an extension of all their goals. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I can see that now. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Maybe when I was younger I resented it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  Maybe, or did -- what -- what -- how did you feel when -- ho-how did you feel about yourself at that time, and how did you -- did -- did you have anger? </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Did you have --

QUESTION:  -- compassion, did you have -- December 7, 2000
ANSWER:  No, I didn’t have compassion when I was younger, I have much more compassion now. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Confusion, I think was the better idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I knew enough -- it wasn’t anger. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">It’s one of the reasons I left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , because I didn’t want to have anger, I didn’t want to have resentment, and I knew that distance would take care of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">They tried to totally dictate -- my mother, not my father -- cause she just was around more -- dictate my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">In a sense I had -- she had to relive her childhood, her concept of a normal childhood through me. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">If I had boyfriends she would write a script what to say to these boyfriends. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">She would go through their mail to me, you know, judging them either fit or unfit. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">But yet, you know, she did give me freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I -- I dated early. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So - but I-I could see that she was more controlling in a way to give herself control over life. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">She needed control so that she could feel control, because the war didn’t -- not let her have control.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">QUESTION:  How about your father? </span><span class="sentence" id="210">He was fantasy, so --

<p><span class="sentence" id="349">ANSWER:  I actually didn’t make that decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">To this day I have no idea how it came about, but it appears when I was in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , I was put in a program, it was an accelerated program that I only had three years of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and I went to <span class="BUILDING">summer school</span> one summer, and then I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> early. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I don’t know who put me in that program, I have really absolutely no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I wouldn’t recommend it, to be honest, to anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">But I -- I think they basically said that I was too mature to stay in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and I just didn't fit in, which is an interesting way, I suppose, to put it. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And so December 7, 2000 I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> early, and I didn’t apply <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">My mother recognized that we were starting to fight, I mean, I was hitting puberty. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">If I -- if I lived -- <span class="BUILDING">college</span> at 16, then you know, puberty starts 14 - 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I wa -- I was one, in the throes of it, but I don’t know if my mother really knew how to deal with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">One, children weren’t supposed to talk against -- back to their parents, weren't supposed to argue with their parents, they were supposed to be little mannequins. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">My mother always told me how wonderful she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">My mother would tell me how -- a good student she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">My mother always said how she listened to her parents, and I was not like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">So I guess what she was doing is trying to avoid, one a fight, and dealing with puberty. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And I left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I only came back one summer, first summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Because after <span class="BUILDING">college</span> they tried to put me, I remember, on a 10 o’clock tur -- curfew, and they didn't want me to grow up. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">They wanted me to go away, but not to grow up. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And that was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And I think it was difficult for them, too.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  Wh-Why do you think that is?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  Cause he was probably a very rebellious r -- youth, and you know, he really -- a little bit of himself was shining through through me, and I don’t know whe -- he probably smiled and was outraged at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  It’s kind of interesting, I didn’t want to interrupt you, but I did bring the interview with your mother and when I asked her in the very beginning how she would describe herself before the war, she said this, Amalie Petranker was very happy go lucky child with shiny eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">She couldn’t carry for a long time a grudge or hatred. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">She loved people, but she was also a fighter, because she was a middle child. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So she learned to fight for her rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">She was a little mischievous, she was rebellious, she questioned her parent’s judgment. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Did you ever meet that person? </span><span class="sentence" id="461">December 7, 2000

ANSWER:  They were silent. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">They gave him an amazing amount of respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Probably admiration that he -- he survived and he was a soldier and that he made it, and oh, he fought the Germans, or the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">So they respected him, cause a lot of these kids were street kids, and they have a re -- respect of the pecking order. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And he was, you know, lieutenant governor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , and that was pe -- you know, prestigious position. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And I hope they walked away from that with some knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">We also did a trial where -- we did a rape trial and I made the boys the victim, and had the women of the class on the jury and the judge. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I reversed entire roles. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And that was interesting because I’m very attuned to victims.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="552">ANSWER:  She wanted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Well, she wanted to go because there was a man who helped save her life, his name was Mundek, and I -- he was very ill at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And my mother said that he was always in love with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">He never married. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">He’d saved 12 girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And she wanted me to meet him. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And so my sophomore year of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and at that time you couldn’t go as a Jewish group to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Didn’t exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">You had to go with a Roman Catholic group, led by a priest to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And that’s how we went, and that’s -- it was very interesting because I never told them in December 7, 2000 the group that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I mean, I never brought it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">My mother didn't bring it up either. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">She basically said, you know, let us blend in right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And I remember the priest took a liking to me, and he always tried to make me go to confession to all these different <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And I kind of bowed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And we had one week that we were spending with our friends, with the people that helped save my father, and the people who helped save my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">But while we were in the tour group, there was also a -- a group, they were the fir -- there was a group of first Christians or something like that, they were from <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> , and they don’t cross themselves either, and they don’t go into confession. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">So I kind of said I -- I can’t do that, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And he had no clue that I was Jewish, none. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And there was a woman there who right away everybody knew she was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">She also had a -- she was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , so she had the symbol. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">But even before, they kind of knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">They used to tell Jewish jokes on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , and they still made fun of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Hardly any Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at the time and they still made fun of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And I -- and I knew then how my mother felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I used to wear a Moses holding the 10 commandments. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">I wore it on the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="579">It was very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Then we spent a week with the families. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And I met Mundek, but we couldn’t talk to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">But he was if -- there was like a light in his eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">He was a very interesting, very nice man. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">But I spent -- we stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that -- of the woman who saved my father, because she had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And she had two children my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">We couldn't speak very well, but they all kind of -- if they knew that December 7, 2000 I was Jewish, it was just never brought up. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Holocaust was never brought up, never discussed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">There was a language barrier. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">But there was one boy who came over who did bring it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And -- and we liked each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And I said to him, by the way, do you know that I was Jewish?

<p><span class="sentence" id="617">QUESTION:  When was that trip, roughly?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="622">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">ANSWER:  No, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> then, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">The trip was -- that was also very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but again remember, we went with a Catholic group. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And now they have tours and say Jews died there. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">When we went there, they didn't tell us Jews died there. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">The official tour was that many people died there, period. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Not one word that Jews died there. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">But you could see that -- the fingernails in the <span class="DLF">wall</span> -- in the <span class="DLF">cement walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="631">You can see imbedded lines that match fingernails in -- in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And you just have a chill. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I mean, you know, there’s just a silence and a chill. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And that’s -- you know, you realize that it will never hap -- you’re not going to December 7, 2000 let it happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">But that’s something for the perspective, versus dwelling on the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">QUESTION:  What was your mother’s response to that -- da -- ha -- and what -- what was your relationship to each other at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">ANSWER:  We were close. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">That was probably one trip that we were quite close. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I probably was not a very warm child. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">My mother wasn’t that warm either, I mean, she would hold my hand, and -- and stuff like that, and I didn't want her to hold my hand cause I thought that was not the right thing to do, you know, women holding hands together. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">But she would never come and hug and cuddle and kiss me. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And I in turn was not a huggy, cuddly person either. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I’m much more with my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">But we were close. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I think that we did hold hands then. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">It was almost like the world against us, except for these people that we stayed with. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">It tends to bind you.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1111">QUESTION:  Well actually, the -- the -- the last question was not so much about your -- the survivors, but about the children of the survivors, whether you kind of -- if you read books about the second generation, whether you were interested in it, first of all, to read those, and if you did, did you find yourself in them, or do you feel that you don’t quite fit there either? </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">Is --
ANSWER:  No, I haven’t read it so much, but it’s very interesting is that you know who another child survivor is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">If I walk in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> I can tell, and they can tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">I can’t explain it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1115">QUESTION:  Try.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1116">ANSWER:  It’s like when I went to a Schecter meeting and there was another woman there and we talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">And I found out she was a survivor -- a child survivor, and we just knew that each other were child survivors, it’s some -- maybe our outlook on life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">We’re a little more serious, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">Probably a little more warped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">Family, I think, December 7, 2000 for child survivors are very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">I find that is a unifying fact in every one of the child survivors that I’ve met. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">There’s this woman now from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , that we met through another family, child surviv -- you know, survivor, and we’re -- we’re close, it just -- I know what you’ve gone through, I know the stories that you’ve gone through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">I know that, you know, your parents always say that, you know, we didn’t have this and you do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">And we’re doing all this for you cause we have no one else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">You just know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And you know that either you’re going to resent your parents for it, or you try to deal with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">I don’t resent them for who they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">Maybe when I was younger a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">I can understand that they went through <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , and that I’m just going to have to be accepting of who they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">I’m not going to be able to change them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">You know, for many years you try to change somebody, and you realize you can’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">So you either respect them, or you distance yourself, or you want to have nothing to do with them, those are the three choices. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">When you don’t have a family, that’s not an option. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">They’re the only things that I have to a family, so it’s just not an option. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">And so that’s why I keep telling my kids, this is all we have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">We don’t have anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">You have to stand up for each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">You have to stick together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">That kind of bonding I’m not sure is in a regular family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">Everybody else is doing their own thing and not -- I tell the brothers, you better protect each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">Who else do you have? </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">You know, you better understand, you may not like what [indecipherable] have to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">They come in and my father will scream at them, December 7, 2000 they’re not wearing socks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">And they say, we’re not cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">And that we’re bad children because we don’t tell our kids to wear socks when they command it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">But I tell them, you know, you have to understand from where they’re coming from. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">Put yourselves in their shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">I don’t know whether or not if you’re not a survi -- child survivor that you can understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">Or if you’re not gone through that kind of generation, I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1150">QUESTION:  Among your friends, are there any children of survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1151">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">Except for that one friend who 1s Israeli, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">I -- I -- like I belong to a group of -- Havurah group, no, none of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1154">QUESTION:  Conscious choice or happenstance, or who knows?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1155">ANSWER:  I think it was more happenstance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">I mean I am friendly with this woman who is a survivor, but part of it subconsciously could be I still want -- I want to be an American. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">I want to fit in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">I don’t know whether I’m co -- more closely to a lin -- aligned to these people be-because they’re Americans, but you know, if you also associate with survivors, you tend to bring it up a lot more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">That means you’re reliving it and reliving it and reliving it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">And I don’t want to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">When the articles come out on my parents, I’m proud, I-I show them to my kids, and they read them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">The little one is proud because his father is famo -- grandfather, you know, 1s famous, he looks at it that way, and you know -- my father goes, well, that’s not a good enough reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">I said, let him bond that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">When he’s older he can develop December 7, 2000 other -- a-and Dustin is much more respective of my parents now as he’s older and understands more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">So I see that the time is coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">They don’t see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">They had no parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">They had no parents who ever butt into their lives, so they don’t understand when or when not to butt into our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">They just never had any mentors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">So -- a-and that’s why we sent them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schecter</span> , to be proud of their heritage, of who they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">And again, to make sure that it won’t happen again to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">And I think they see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">I mean, my -- my middle one will go into a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , very -- very -- and say, hey, there’s Christmas stuff, but there’s no Hanukkah stuff, why? </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">I don’t think an American kid would really pay attention to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">So it has sunk in a little bit, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">I mean, maybe not the way that my parents -- but he’s very proud of who he is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">He’s very proud that he’s Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">It was difficult cause my oldest son was dating a non-Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">I think my mother was much more willing to see -- let’s wait and see, my father went -- still goes bananas over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">Absolutely goes banana -- has major battles with my son.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1181">QUESTION:  How do you feel about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1182">ANSWER:  I -- if it’s on tape and they marry I’m in trouble, but I don’t like her, because I don’t like her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">I don’t like her personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">He knows that I would be very upset if he married a non-Jew and wouldn’t bring the children up Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">I would -- 1-1f the -- if the person would convert, I don’t have an issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">I don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">Then they’re as good as anyone else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">Because I think part of our heritage would be lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">And I -- and I am December 7, 2000 very close to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">I mean, my son’s Bar Mitzvahs -- you know, when you have a kid who lives in an affluent society and he’s having a Bar Mitzvah, it’s very difficult to have him not focused on what gifts I’m going to get, versus, do you understand what this mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">That this 1s a tradition that you are perpetuating over thousands of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">That if you’re not proud of who you are as a Jew, people will step on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">Maybe an American doesn’t understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">And I look. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">If somebody’s talking about Jews, or saying something and I hear it in the background, I'll speak up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">I’m very proud of this person, his name is Lenny Zakim. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">He died of a brain tumor last year, he was 47- t-two years ago, almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">They’re actually debating to name a -- the new <span class="DLF">bridge</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> after him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">He was part of the ADL, and he went to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> with me [indecipherable] was -- he was a year ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">I wasn’t socially -- we were not on social basis, but we always used to say hello to each other from the same <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">And he would really go around, and make sure about anti-Semitism and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">But it was only -- not only anti-Semitism, it was anti blacks, anti anybody who had issues. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">And I think I’m instilling that in my kids, about discrimination. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">That’s a product of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">It’s not only discrimination that you’re Jewish, and believe me, I’ve had some anti-Semitism, I haven’t had a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">My kids haven’t had so much, so they don’t know yet what it is, but they will, and I want them to be prepared for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">December 7, 2000
QUESTION:  I just have actually a -- a couple of follow up questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">Otherwise, I think we have touched on a lot of important things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">And one is a very practical one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">I forgot to ask you when, just for the record, when your children were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1211">ANSWER:  Dustin was born March 11, 1983. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">Aaron was born December 17", 1987, and Michael was born February 28", 1990. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">I have to say one thing is though, I’ve had many miscarriages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">That’s why I have the big gap between the oldest and the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">And because I really wanted a family, I never gave up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">I had eight miscarriages -- no- yeah, eight miscarriages, three live births. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">And I think part of that keeping me going, although I would get almost hives when I would go into the op -- the -- the -- the <span class="BUILDING">gynecologist’s office</span> was that I really wanted a family th -- to perpetuate our heritage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">That was very important to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">So I just didn’t give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">And they know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">I mean, I sing Shema to them every night, and even my s -- oldest one still asks for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">To understand, you know, that this is where it’s coming from. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">I don’t know - Shema is an affirmation of one God, but it’s also supposed to be said as the last thing on your mouth before death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">And then, just you know, make sure that they understand that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1225">QUESTION:  One other question until I remember another one, is sort of political. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">You have gone through, in your teens actually, Civil Rights movement, Women’s movement, all of these things kind of are also part of who you are to some degree at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">To December 7, 2000 what kind of degree? </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">What -- what -- what moved you, politically speaking? </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">What was important to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1230">ANSWER:  Justice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">I was for the Women’s movement for equality and for justice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">I don’t go over backwards on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">I mean, I don’t want any more rights, but I want to be respected. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">I am -- I’ve dealt with that personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">I was a women’s lawyer where they were just starting to have women lawyers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">I mean, there were men in my class, but the older men didn’t have women in their classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">I was called deary during trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">And -- and -- and my theory in life, as I handle almost everything with that one is somebody goes -- this one woman that was just outraged that he was calling me deary, aren’t you going to say anything to him? </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">And I said, no, because I’m not going to change him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">But if I’m a deary, I’m stupid, so I’m going to take it to my advantage, and just prepare. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">And I won that trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">And my basic thing is I start off with honey. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">Burn me and you’re in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">And then [ll y -- rant, rave and scream, but I usually don’t rant, rave and scream first, cause I saw my parents rant -- my father rant, raving and screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">I’m not sure that he was better off for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">I had a -- I was pregnant with my first child and they told me I was unfit to try the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">Not the judge, but an attorney on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , because I would be going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">He was a black attorney. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">The judge threw -- it was Christmas eve, the judge threw it out, and said I’m not touching this -- at least he was wise enough -- I’m not touching this one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">It’s much better for the younger women attorneys, I December 7, 2000 guarantee you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">They didn't have to fight that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">I campaigned when I was in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , for Scoop Jackson. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">I went around and I did a lot of political planning, but a -- it was a -- politics 1s a very dirty animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">I didn’t like the dirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">So I -- and especially for a woman, it’s much e -- more of a dirty animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">I fight for justice wherever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">For special education and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">I’m an independent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">I’m registered as an independent, because then I’m not locked in the primary to vote for a Republican or Democrat, and I wanted to see where my vote counts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">So I’m more of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">I mean, I hear what’s going on with Gore and -- and I’m outraged because I think that there were a lot of shenanigans going on and the people’s votes weren’t counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">It’s not so much Gore as a person to win, or Bush, though I think Bush 1s an idiot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">But the fact is that these people were turned away from voting, these votes didn’t count. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">And that gets my gall. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">It’s the underdog again, that gets my gall. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">I’ve rallied for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">I don’t do it so much now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">I’m a little more laid back now than I used to be, but that’s the only way I can handle my work load and my kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">Cause I don’t have three wallflowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">I mean, sometimes I wish for three wallflowers, but I don’t have them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">And I want to make sure that they grow up to be people that give to the community, that’s important to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">They give something of themselves to the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">My oldest son gave 10 percent of his Bar Mitzvah money to charity, to the Home of Little Wanderers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">That was -- I didn't care which charity, but it was imperative that he gave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">My youngest one says, I know, I have to give. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">So at least I -- you know, December 7, 2000 good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">You’re going to have to give. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">And he chose -- you know, he’s gonna choo -- he chose that <span class="BUILDING">Home</span> for Little Wanderers, so he’s going to give. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">That’s important, for my kids to give back to the community and not always take. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">It’s not easy, especially when you live in an affluent community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">But my oldest one works at a <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">Third week of the month he cooks and he delivers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">My youngest one -- my middle one does a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">My youngest one has to be pushed a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">He’s probably not as giving at the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">But we’re working on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1287">QUESTION:  I have one more question, but before I ask that final one, is there anything that relates to what we have talked about, and that I haven’t asked -- touched upon, or that’s important for you to say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1288">ANSWER:  I think part of the Holocaust children don’t want -- do not want to be seen as different, a-although we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">We want to be normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">I don’t know what normal is, but we want to be normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">And the only problem is our viewpoint of normalcy comes from a different <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> than other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">I think that we carry -- we’re a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , we really are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">And we carry the torch to our younger generation, our kids, to make sure that they don’t forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">And it’s very hard, because unless they’re living with their grandparents, they can’t understand as much, and you do, so you don’t know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">You understand where they’re coming from, because they’re removed and you understand where you parents are coming from, because you lived with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">And so December 7, 2000 you get battled from both <span class="NPIP">ends</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">And sometimes you feel like the mediator between generations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">And it’s -- it’s not the easiest thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1299">QUESTION:  And my last question is why did you agree to do this interview?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1300">ANSWER:  Part curiosity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">Part my parents, and part that I want people to understand who we are, and to be accepted for who we are.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1302">QUESTION:  Well thank you very much for having accepted the interview.
