<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION: How large was your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="8">How many brothers and sisters did you have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER: I had one brother named Armon Schafler. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">He was two years older than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">He was born on February 28th, 1933, and he died in -- on March 14th, 1999 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> where he had resided all his years in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION: And when and where were your parents born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER: My parents were born -- my mother was born in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berehomet</span> , which was on the <span class="DLF">border</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bukovina</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in -- when -- when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bukovina</span> became part of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berehomet</span> became part of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And her -- my grandparents lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Their -- my mother's maiden name was Hollar, Klara Hollar- Schafler. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My grandparents’ name was Malka -- grandmother's name was Malka Hollar. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">My grandfather's name was Malkilabe(ph) Hollar. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And my mother also had other siblings in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">She had two sisters that survived the Holocaust, but her brother did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">He was deported from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berehomet</span> with his family to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Moldova</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transnistria</span> , and they -- well, they -- they were either beaten to death or died of starvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">He didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">He was very ill, and he died in 1945 in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but he was very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">My mother had another brother who was a banker in <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> and during Kristallnacht, he -- he was -- the police came to pick him up, told him that he needed to open the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> for some urgent matter, and he was never seen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">His name was Benja -- Bena Hollar in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So they -- in the morning, they let her know that he had a sudden appendicitis attack and died. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So his wife and son left <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and went to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">His son became a professor at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Connecticut</span> at the Connecticut Institute for Research. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And I don't know, the lady, his widow, died. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My father was born in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vishnitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">He comes from a long <span class="DLF">line</span> of people that lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vishnitz</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vishnitz</span> is also part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And a long <span class="DLF">line</span> of people empowered. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Somebody had -- with an interest had tracked the Schafler family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vishnitz</span> and tracked it down to 19 -- to 1845 where the -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , it probably the equivalent of mayor or executive, was a Schafler. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And the Schafler family wasa_——_—s educcated family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vishnitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">That's all I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">My father's parents I did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">They died during the 1918 group epidemic. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">My father was, at the time, a student at the University of Konstanz in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So he didn't know too much about them, about their death. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And then he -- and then he -- at the time, he may have also ready been -- he was eventually a prisoner in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> , the German army -- he was in the German army and he was taken prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So he didn't know much about the circumstances of their death. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">But that's all I know about my -- he had -- he had siblings. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">He had two sisters and -- and a brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And there's more about -- it was an interesting experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">One of his sisters when -- when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bukovina</span> was annexed to Soviet Union, one of his sisters was married to a very wealthy man. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And he was with her when they had two children, and they had a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">They were -- as soon as the Soviet -- the Soviets occupied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bukovina</span> , they were deported to -- to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So they -- they went with the older children who were then teens, and they left the baby behind to their sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">They figured they're coming back and they'll get him. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Well, they -- they didn't come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">They came like 40 years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">They went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and the son was raised by the sister and didn't know his parents and did not relate to them, and that was the end of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And the others -- I don't know -- you know, they died of natural causes 1n various <span class="NPIP">places</span> , mostly in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">They all came to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">They were not interred in any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> ; as were my mother's sisters, they were not interred either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION: And can you tell me what was your family life like? </span><span class="sentence" id="56">What was your childhood like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  Well, my family life was a middle class, upper middle class family life. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">We lived in -- in those days, everybody lived in <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I guess they owned it or they didn't own it, I don't really know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But we had a lovely <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We always had household help, a maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">When I was younger, we had a nurse maid, sort of ananny. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">We -- I was -- it was a very nice <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">We had a nice life. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">My dad was the -- was a CPA. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">He was an accountant and financial manager for <span class="BUILDING">Auto Mataro(ph</span> ), which was the <span class="BUILDING">Ford distribution center</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bukovina</span> , and it was all and elegant, sort of Austrian style. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And my mother, as I mentioned, we always had a maid, and it was common in -- 1n those days in Europe to -- to go on the <span class="DLF">promenade</span> around noon, between noon and one o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">There were certain main <span class="DLF">avenues</span> , you went on the prom -- it was true even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">My mother and her sisters dolled up every day and went to the promenade. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And my dad came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for the midday meal at one o'clock and we ate, and then he took a nap, and went back to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> around four. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And that's what I remember a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I remember my mother's sisters, especially the youngest one, was very beautiful, tall, blonde, and she was sort of assertive and, you know -- I suppose we're not supposed to appear assertive, and they -- she was teased that she walked like a sergeant, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">She -- on the promenade, she was sort of assertive. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">That was a daily event. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And my parents entertained. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">My parents went out to -- for evening functions. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">One -- I remember one night there was -- obviously the maid was living in. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">My -- my parents were out, and my brother woke up and they weren't there, so he went and woke me up and said "They're not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." "</span><span class="sentence" id="79">Okay." "</span><span class="sentence" id="80">Come, let's -- let's look." </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And we went out on the <span class="DLF">terrace</span> and we were looking for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Well, my parents were coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and they could see the children on the <span class="DLF">terrace</span> at one o'clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">They didn't know what to make of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">You know, they asked me -- well, they asked him, and I don't know what he said, but they asked me and I said, "I don't know, he told me to get up." </span><span class="sentence" id="85">You know, that's about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">He was two years older and told me and I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">The maid didn't know about this, and my parents were upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So I -- I remember a very nice middle class, upper middle class life. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">We had -- we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> at the disposal of the chauffeur. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I don't think my dad drove. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Certainly my mother didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And my mother spent time with her family -- with her sisters, spent time homemaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">You know, she baked and cooked and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Holiday dinners, I remember Passover Seders. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Dinner parties, when I woke up and -- and heard voices and got up to -- to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> or <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and asked what time it was, which, you know, shocked my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">There was tea in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Neighbors invited me for tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And there were two ladies, or my mother described them as spinsters, and they wanted to pump me about secret -- you know, family secrets. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Not so much family secrets. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I don't know what they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">But like my mother's two sisters, and the one wasn't married and the other one was just engaged, who were they seeing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">They were pumping me, basically, but I liked it, you know, and I talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">You know, three years old, anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Four years old, anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So I remember a very -- my brother had started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> before the Soviet occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">He went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , which took -- because a lot of the Jewish children went to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">But my parents -- my dad used his influence and wanted him to go to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">He was -- he's very smart, he was very smart, but he -- he was sort of a troublemaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">He did something, throw it in the garbage, put it on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , which almost got him expelled. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">My dad had to go and use his influence. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I did not start <span class="BUILDING">school</span> until the Soviet occupation other than -- than <span class="BUILDING">dancing school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And I had neighbors that I played with and friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And it was -- I had a lot of toys and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">In fact, ours was a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> , and my parents were concerned - | had been ill when I was three. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I had whooping cough and -- and scarlet fever, so there were a series of some kidney problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So my parents were concerned that I wasn't gaining weight. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And, you know, Jewish mother always worries about the kid not eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So they felt that maybe ham would -- would put weight on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">But, of course, they couldn't bring it into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So the maid every afternoon for the -- what 1s called yowzah, for the -- the tea time, would take me to a -- a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that sold ham sandwiches where I could eat a ham on hard rolls. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I ate part of it anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">That was a daily ritual, I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And I had -- and my closest friend, play friend, was -- well, actually I met a little girl in the <span class="DLF">park</span> whose father was -- two I had -- her I was just fascinated. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">But my closest girlfriend, the -- this girl I met in the <span class="DLF">park</span> , little girl in the <span class="DLF">park</span> , her father was a bus driver. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And they lived in a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and she invited me to come over. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So the maid took me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But when the maid told -- yeah, I didn't know one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> from three, but I liked being in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> because everybody was in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So the -- my -- my parents, my mother, was not too excited about that, about this relationship after the maid told her that they live in a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But I -- I did still insist on going. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And since she didn't have too many toys, my uncle had come -- Uncle Jupiter had come back from the toy fair in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Every year, they have this big toy fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And he brought me some toys which I already -- some of them I already had like a new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baby doll buggy</span> , so I gave them to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And my parents may not have liked it, but I don't know what they said. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">But my brother, my brother had something to say about that, and he said, "You are gonna make us poor." </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Because I gave my toys away, these toys that Uncle Jupiter brought me. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And the other friend that I spent a lot of time with was a little girl named Anita. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">She was -- Anita Gelburd. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">She was three years older than I was, and she had four -- I mean three older sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">There were four girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">The oldest one was eighteen, nineteen, and there were a couple in between, and she was seven and I was five. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">She was -- since when I was four, and she was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And I loved being there because there was girl talk, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">There was a lot of commotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was quiet, you know, kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And there it was commotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And unfortunately, the whole -- they were deported, all the Gelburds -- the older daughter had gotten married somewhere in between and had a child, but the rest of the family was deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And when -- when people were coming back when -- when the nightmare ended, and the oldest sister, whose name I think was Lenny, saw that her family didn't come back, she committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Whole family went out {Crying}. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">That was my childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Sort of uneventful. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">You know, it just -- used to go see my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">My grandparents were religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Shabbat -- Shabbat was Shabbat. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">You had Friday night dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I liked my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">My grandfather was something 1n a <span class="BUILDING">wood factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I don't know what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">He was a supervisor or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And on Shabbat, people would come over and -- and, you know, they'd -- my grandmother would bake stuff on Friday, make challah, and she gave me a piece of dough and I could work -- work the system. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And they were -- they were kind people that I -- I loved. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And didn't see that much of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And I -- they were a different way of life than -- than we were used to, but it was a nice life. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">The whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> -- you know, there was a main <span class="DLF">street</span> , and their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">They were all individual <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And she -- people would walk by and see you on the <span class="DLF">porch</span> and that kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">It was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They had a <span class="DLF">garden</span> in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And unfortunately, they were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moghilev</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">They -- they died. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">They weren't killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">They died of malnutrition probably, and they were older so didn't see too much of them after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">You know, after the war started, we didn't see too much of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So that's basically -- I didn't start -- when the Soviets occupied the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bukovina</span> , when it was annexed, wasn't occupied, they would like to say it was annexed, in 1940, I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in <span class="BUILDING">Russian school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Now, I -- to roll back, when my dad used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for -- for his -- the midday meal, then he would lie -- lie down, I guess it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I know he was -- he lied down and I lied down right alongside of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Had my head on the -- sort of under his arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I learned to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I learned to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">We spoke German at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but I had learned to read Romanian and to speak Romanian, and I also later learned some Russian, even before -- before <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">But Romanian and German I had learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And when I didn't learn from -- when I was reading the paper with my dad would -- what I didn't learn, I sort of translated myself, you know, like -- I remember an example that my family had repeated, namely that in German whipped cream is schlagsahne, meaning beating, and sahne -- or schlagobers, the Austrians used to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Well, schlag means beating and -- and obers 1s a colonel. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">That's the -- so I had translated batoot(ph), you know, beaten colonel for -- for whipped cream. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">That was my accomplishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And people teased -- my parents teased, my brother especially teased me about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">It was a quiet life, pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">You know, no -- no particular drama until just before the Soviet occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I remember my parents, we -- my mother and the children had been visiting the grandparents, and my father came for the weekend and was -- was telling my parent -- my mother and the grandparents that the maids -- they were usually Ukrainian or Lithuanian, and they -- that there -- there is unrest, that there is hooliganism. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">But I mean it was abstract. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">It wasn't -- nothing had happened to us or to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">But there was some cloud on the horizon. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And in 1940, the -- the Soviet marched in. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">It wasn't -- 1t wasn't like Army takeover. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">It was -- they just sort of marched in. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">It was by agreement, although they had bombed, apparently, the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">So it was sort of different but much the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">The -- the Soviet -- the Auto Matoro was eviscerated. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And my dad, they wanted -- some town father or whatever these people had as commanders wanted my dad to be the accountant for Meloche (ph) Trust. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">In -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> , in communistic structures, everything is a trust. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">It's the milk trust and the - the shoe trust and the -- so Meloche Trust was the dairy trust, and my dad became the accountant and chief financial officer for the dairy trust. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And, you know, we basically went on the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I don't remember whether it was <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> or first grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I mean I don't know that I would have been able to tell the difference actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">But it was Russian and -- My parents entertained some -- I remember my parents entertained some -- somebody from the company, some people from the company, Russians, and the guys were amazed how people lived, you know, the beauty, what they considered luxury. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I mean we were upper middle class people, but we weren't by no means rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Just well off, I guess, comfortable off, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And he -- he was just amazed at how people lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And he said something to my parents, and my brother felt compelled to answer, so he said, "Yeah, this is all nice, but they call us dirty Jews." </span><span class="sentence" id="211">So he said, "Well, you can call me anything you want as long as you feed me honey." </span><span class="sentence" id="212">So that was sort of a -- an indication of -- of a perception of what they had, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">But other than that, the year went uneventful again, and you went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and you -- my Uncle Jupiter was not too {Coughs} excited about it because he was a businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">He - he did international business with -- with <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and he couldn't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So he was not too excited but, you know, he had to put up and shut up, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And when the Naz -- on July 21, 1941, the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">I mean Nazis invaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Actually, rolling back, in '39 I remember when <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was invaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">How do I remember it is that my mother had taken me for someplace, to some -- somewhere, and we were coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And in front of the perfect , the police there, which was the major police entity, there were people sitting on -- on packages on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And I had asked "Why are they there", and my mother told me that -- this was in September 1939 -- that these people are from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they are refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And -- and just as we were standing there, a dog came by and bit my thigh, you know, chubby little thighs of little girls, and that was a big minor crisis. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">You know, I don't think he broke the skin, I don't remember, just that the idea of it was a major thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So in 1941 -- and we knew that Hitler had invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and that there was -- and in 1941, the Nazis, on June 21st, 1941, the Nazis occupied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> and then everything changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">That was not benign, that was not -- it was -- first of all, 1t was war, number one, although you didn't feel it that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">But there were -- there were a lot of anti-Semitic outbursts. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">A lot of <span class="DLF">windows</span> broke and a lot of <span class="BUILDING">Jewish businesses</span> broken and -- I don't -- and lot of Jewish businesses just simply put out of business. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And -- and the Nazis had plans, had made plans to basically make <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherowitz</span> , to expel all the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Although my Uncle Jupiter was not -- he said, "Oh, they're not gonna do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And he was -- he was amenable. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">He was pleased that -- that the Soviets had gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Oh, let me roll back. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">In 1939, when Europe was getting just by things not looking so well, the <span class="BUILDING">Ford Motor Company</span> in <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> had -- had offered my father and his family to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And my mother said, "Who goes to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Only people that want to get away from a bad wife." </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Because in Europe, divorce was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Or people that can't make it financially and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So that was one opportunity missed. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And -- and when the Soviets were retreating, they offered my dad to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And my parents were sort of torn, I guess, about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">But Uncle Jupiter said, "No way, don't -- don't you dare", you know, kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">So that was the other opportunity that -- that was missed. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And in 1941 -- so when they occupied, Jewish children could not go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And they -- they started forming a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">All -- all Jews had to move into a certain <span class="REGION">area</span> where Jews -- let me roll back. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Uncle Jupiter immediately went into business or -- or revived an old business, I'm really not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">But food transport, eggs, stuff like that was a big business in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I -- I didn't really know that until much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And he was involved with shipping aid -- you know, transporting food, eggs, dairy, who knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">That business was not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">It was, what, 40, 50 miles away in some small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So he was back in -- he was in business immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And so when they -- when they tried to make <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> , they ordered people to move into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> , you know, certain <span class="DLF">streets</span> where Jews had lived and where the <span class="BUILDING">kosher shops</span> were and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But 5,000 people or whatever thousand, I don't know, maybe -- maybe more, maybe 6,000 were permitted to stay in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> because they were needed to run the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I mean they were the professors and the physicians and the businessmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And we were permitted to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and Uncle Jupiter was permitted to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and so were -- so was my uncle, my father's brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And so we were <span class="BUILDING">home</span> but -- and then these people that had gone to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- so, there 1s -- apparently there was a list that they put people on, and these people could stay in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And those that had been put in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , some were transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transnistria</span> , and some were allowed to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they would have transports later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Well, we never went so, you know, we were considered not at risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And this was like in September or in the fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And the next -- so after the winter, the next deportation -- these were deportations, by the way, they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">The next deportations -- I didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">My brother didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I had a non-Jewish friend that I met in <span class="BUILDING">dancing school</span> , and then in the year -- her name was Adele Havriluk. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Her father was a prominent attorney. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And then in that one year of schooling that was either <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> or first grade, I don't know which one, and they -- they used to come over and bring me school work. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And so to keep me in touch with school work, and -- and bring stuff for my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So then in the -- the next deportations were ordered to take place in June of 1942, and they were to be -- to take place on three consecutive Sundays. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Oh, my dad -- my dad had a job, so Uncle -- he worked in Uncle Jupiter's business of -- of food transport, had something to do with eggs and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And my dad would travel with Uncle Jupiter every weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">He would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> every weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">He would travel every Monday, go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So Jews had to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on those three consecutive Sundays, and that didn't affect us the first two Sundays. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">The third Sunday -- and I had, in fact, said goodbye to some neighbor girl that I knew, whose name I don't even remember, but I know I had said goodbye to somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">But the third Sunday, Uncle Jupiter had sent a chauffeur. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So Jews couldn't be out, but he -- he could send a chauffeur. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And my dad had come back on Friday. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">He had -- he went to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> or he picked up money, had a briefcase full of money, real money, two hundred -- the equivalent of $250,000 to pay wages, to buy material, who knows why. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">That's what he had. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">The briefcase was lying in our <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> , like the <span class="INT_SPACE">entrance hall</span> had like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And Uncle Jupiter sent the chauffeur Sunday evening about eight o'clock or so to suggest that we come to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , that we stay with -- with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And my mother said, "Nah, I don't want to go." </span><span class="sentence" id="283">You know, Max is going to -- back to -- I can't remember the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where this business was, and he has this money and, you know, Uncle Jupiter was going with him so he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And, you know, "Bathe the children, put them to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I don't think so." </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Well, that was our last chance, because in the middle of the night about midnight, the -- the doorbell rang and it was the police, and they said they wanted us to go to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> to check the documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Don't worry about it, nothing serious, just check the documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So we dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">My -- I dressed myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I remember wearing kneesocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">That's what every kid wore, kneesocks, little kneesocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And we -- when we got out of our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , there were -- there was a lot of police and a lot of people in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that were going, but we also -- my parents saw, I didn't have the perception to understand it, that somebody was giving some policeman a bag of jewelry and they didn't go, they didn't leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So -- but, you know, my parents were secure that -- that once he -- they know that he's needed, then the business will open, it won't have any money, that nothing would happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Well, that was obviously wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">We -- we left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in a -- like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , and we were taken to -- to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And my dad, we didn't have any -- we didn't pack any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> , although some people had taken something. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">My dad had the briefcase of money, and that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And we learned later that the -- that they were short on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">They had to have 2,000 people in the three -- three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> , and they were short 120 people on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">So they just went into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they knew Jews lived and took them, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I mean who's gonna hold them accountable? </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So that was basically how we were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transnistria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">That ended the childhood that I experienced.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">QUESTION: Did you have any sense of what <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> meant before that moment? </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Had you heard about <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> , or was this the first -- your first experience with it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">ANSWER: I mean I knew what a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was as a forceable sort of thing, but I -- I didn't really. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Neither did my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">We didn't really. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And we sort of relied on -- on something, I'm not sure what that something was. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I cannot articulate now. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">But we relied on status or something that -- that it's gonna turn out okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And in fact, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that -- that we were on, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> , it stopped in -- outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moghilev</span> someplace, and people were looking for water. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Obviously we had no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Oh, the night before when my mother said, "Oh, we'll stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , bathe the kids, put them to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> ", we were having dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Not that - the big meal was usually at noon, but some dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And my brother who always complained said, "Nah, I don't like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">It's too greasy." </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I don't know what it was, I can't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And my mother said, "Some day you're gonna be hungry and you won't have anything to eat." </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Just to, you know, to -- he was getting a little on her nerves, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">It was a constant thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">He wouldn't eat, and complain, and she would worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">It was a merry-go-round. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And there he was, two days later he was hungry, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">There was nothing to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So it was like {Coughs} was he clairvoyant, was it a feeling that -- who knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">She never -- we never discussed it again because -- at the same time, if she had any feelings, she should've -- we should've gone to my uncle's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">So we were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped -- well, my uncle, the concierge where we lived, my parents told them to go to Jupiter's, which was I don't know how many -- the distance was, and tell him that we were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And he did do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">So my uncle put in -- in motion all kinds of -- called all kinds of people by nine o'clock to get us off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , but you couldn't, I mean -- and to get us out and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">So when -- when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped, I went to get some water, and I saw people, and I don't -- I had a container, but I don't remember where I got it and what it was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And it was down a <span class="DLF">hill</span> , and I slipped and I injured my knee. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">It might have been something glass that I held, but it was a big cut on my knee, and there was nothing to -- to deal with it, nothing to clean, nothing to clean with, so that became infected. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And for the next three months or more, July, August, September, three months, I couldn't bend the knee. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">It was -- it was swollen and hot, and I couldn't bend it. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">So -- but I'll tell you once we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , if you wanted to ask me about getting there, so this is how we wound up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transnistria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we were taken was Cariera de Piatra, which is a <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> , translated <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">It was- it had a Romanian commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And we were unloaded, and there were <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> from I guess the people that worked there at the <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> , so we were put into <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I don't remember much about the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> other than that there were a lot of people in each <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and that we slept on like pallets, wooden pallets, but they were -- they were off the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , but they were -- they were contiguous, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">It was like -- so that's what I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And every day I was sitting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I don't know whether they carried me. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I was sitting on a big rock with my leg, my swollen leg, and it was getting bigger and I couldn't bend it. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And I had little pig -- pigtails and sat there and at some point -- if you want me to continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Did you want to ask me something else? </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I mean I'll continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">QUESTION:  Were you together with your family at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">ANSWER: Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">QUESTION: And how long was the journey from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">ANSWER: It probably was about four days, five days. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And if you want me to continue, I'll tell you about being there. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">So the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was commanded by a Romanian officer, and he would walk around every day, and -- and the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were like in a circle around the piazza, if you will, or the -- I can't think of another word at the moment -- that round sort of in the middle of it for -- So he would just sort of walk around every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">He would come by. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And he would see me and he would go by and pull my pigtails and look at the knee and, you know, smile or pat my head or something and -- and walk on. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">At some point, I don't know whether -- how my parents heard, but my -- my father figured he has to return the money to the company. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">So he gave the -- the camp commander, about maybe a month later, month and a half, the briefcase full of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And the commander returned it to the company. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">He did not pocket it. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And the -- my uncles -- so with the -- I mean the authorities that could do that were impressed that my father returned the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">It never occurred to him to buy his way out with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And -- and that the camp commander forwarded it on. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">So he -- but somehow the camp commander had been told that there are efforts underway -- can I get you more comfortable -- that there are efforts underway to bring us back. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">So what we -- you know, we were hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">People were dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">My parents did their best to -- the people -- my parents -- my father had to work on the <span class="DLF">quarries</span> , I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I don't remember much of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Some local farmers came with -- selling food. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">If you had money, you could buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">You had to sell stuff to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">But I mean food was scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">I can't say that I ever complained or that my brother ever complained because we knew that our parents -- somehow that childhood that your parents are always on top of you doing the best for you, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">There's so many little things that they demonstrated that. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">So that if there was no food, it's because there was no food kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Well, 1n September, around September or early October -- I mean we didn't have a calendar, didn't know one day from another. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">My parents might have known when it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">The -- there was an edict to exterminate the Jews from Cariera de Piatra, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">But the -- the people to be sent away were to be told that they're being relocated. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So --
QUESTION: And how did you -- how did you know that? </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Is this something you learned later or is this something that you heard from your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">ANSWER: Something I learned later, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">At the time, people didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Something we learned later. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And so one day, there are all these Nazi people. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">There's a setup of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">People are told to line up, get their possessions and get in <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And my family, we were in -- sort of getting ready to go in <span class="DLF">line</span> , and the camp commander must have signaled -- signaled to my parents for -- there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> over there and he was standing over here to -- to the right of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">They were sort of registering people. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And he -- he -- my mother went up to him and said, you know, "Where -- how will this -- how will this affect our returning <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And he looked at her and he said, "Run. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Run over there." </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Now, he was standing this way, he was standing this way (indicating). </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And the Nazis, they were loading on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">He said, "Run to the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Right."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">QUESTION: He told you to run behind him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">ANSWER:  Yeah, "Run over there." </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So my parents ran, my brother, and my knee that I couldn't have -- I ran, and it was oozing. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And -- and he said, "Run and hide." </span><span class="sentence" id="404">So -- so when- once we came -- we ran, there were on that part of the -- of the circle, there were <span class="BUILDING">shacks</span> that must have been <span class="BUILDING">equipment shacks</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">So we -- we entered a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> and there were other people that -- that he had told to hide. {</span><span class="sentence" id="406">Crying} -- this is very emotional, so forgive me, but I think that's -- that's the pivotal thing that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So we went to stay in there, and it turned dark, and water, food, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">One -- before it turned dark, the Nazis went on an ex -- inspection tour with the camp commander, and they said, "What's in there?" </span><span class="sentence" id="409">He said, "Oh, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Old equipment that we don't use and we throw away." </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And they said, "Oh, okay." </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And they walked away, and then we could hear the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> left. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">The next morning, the camp commander asked everybody to come to the square, ordered everybody to come to the square. {</span><span class="sentence" id="414">Crying} and he said, "I saved as many of you as I could." </span><span class="sentence" id="415">There had been 4,000 people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> {Coughs}! </span><span class="sentence" id="416">and now there were about 300. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And he said {Crying}, "Did my best. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">You will have a tough winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">But if you survive the winter, you'll be okay."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">QUESTION: So this was in the fall that this happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">ANSWER:  Yeah, in the fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">We -- and he sent people back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I don't -- but, you know, here is a guy, here 1s -- that the Nazis put in there because they -- they saw in him something that they thought would be to their advantage, and it turned out it wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">So he- he did the best -- he says, "I'll do the best I can to help you." </span><span class="sentence" id="425">There was some food provided, and I don't recall how. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">My brother got typhoid, got typhus, and then he got some infection. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Do you mind if I get a tissue and some water? </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Would you like something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">QUESTION: No, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">One minute. [</span><span class="sentence" id="431">Interview paused]. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">ANSWER: Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Are we okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION: Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER: So my brother had typhoid, and he had an infection in his leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And he was -- for about three weeks, he was unconscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And then I got typhoid. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And I remember nothing till the spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I was very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">My -- my parents had nothing to sell. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">There was a doctor, but he was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I don't know where he got -- they gave people strych -- he gave, to live, I guess, to -- to stimulate the heart, they were giving strychnine shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Why that, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And where he got them, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">But my mother gave some of the wedding -- her wedding ring, and they got the strychnine. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And then we both recovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I had some other illnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">They cut my hair off, you know, my pigtails off. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">They were full of lice anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And then I lost my hair, and then it started growing back. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And then the spring came. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And in the spring, we were transported to -- 120 people were transported to the other -- this other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Capostiano(ph</span> ), which 1s a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and the people were housed in, I don't know, <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> or <span class="BUILDING">shacks</span> that -- and they worked, I guess, the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">My- my family and two other families were housed -- it was -- one of the things in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Capostiano</span> was that it was a sof-house(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="455"><span class="BUILDING">Sof-house</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">co-house</span> , 1s a communal kind of enterprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Everybody has a share in the total. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And in <span class="BUILDING">sof-house</span> is that you keep your own property but you -- you -- what you har -- harvest is communal. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So in other words, if one grows potatoes and one grows carrots, you -- that's communal. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So we were placed - three families. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">There was the Glotters, which was a husband -- he was a soccer player and he was sort of caught in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> in a riot, with his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And he had a baby, a young baby when he was deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">The -- Harry. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">By the time we got together, he -- Harry was two years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And they were the Glotters. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And then there was a retired couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">He was -- had been the Postmaster General for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> , and he was this very distinguished sort of looking man, older man, and his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And my family -- and we -- we received a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on the property of the <span class="BUILDING">sof-house</span> , and again it was sort of like a circle for various functions. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And we -- we were housed in two small <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">When you walked in, there were -- just you could stand or sit or stretch out, lay down, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And across was the dairy -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">milk separators</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">They brought all the milk in there and the machines were sep -- making cheese and butter and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">So that was on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So we had the -- several advantages of being in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">One 1s that we had -- I don't remember whether -- which <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> we had, but we had some -- we used to get some little skim milk or something from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">separators</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And my dad was immediately recruited to -- to do the bookkeeping for the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I mean that's -- that's -- so he went to work every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">My mother did not work, was not demanded to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">She was going around offering -- my mother had been a -- years before she married, she -- she and her sisters, they had a small seamstress designing <span class="BUILDING">salon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">They did ball gowns and debutant gowns and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And so she went around offering her services to the farm women, or to the men telling your wife, and we got some potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">We got to eat -- I love -- I got to love potatoes and even potato skins. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I mean the -- we had -- we were no longer starving as much as we had in the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">So on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , there were two pivotal people that would - it's like a movie, Matt -- Matt Damon. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">He -- there was this guy named Misha. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">He was a young guy, about 25. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">He appeared to be 25 to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Very good looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And I was at the time -- when we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Kazakhstan</span> , I was seven years old, and -- but I knew he was good looking, with a mustache, blonde. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And he was the commander -- you know, he was in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">sof-house</span> , and he would go around and scream at people. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">But the Jewish -- oh, the other Jewish people, the others that were teens, were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">They worked somewhere in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> on <span class="DLF">farms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">On the <span class="BUILDING">sof-house</span> , there were no other deportees. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Just these three families. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">So we had no contact with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Not that we knew them, we didn't, but we also had no contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">So I mean obviously we couldn't leave, or maybe we could, we hever -- it never occurred to somebody to go stroll through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">So there was Misha, and then there was the -- the -- he would come by twice a day or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And, you know, demanding -- he was demanding against the fam -- I mean we didn't have -- he had- maybe he, Mr. Glotter, I think, worked for the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I don't remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">He -- he'd play with little Harry. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And then the other person that would come by every day was an older man, sort of a heavy man. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">He may not have been as heavy, as he wore this big coat, and he wore it all the time, same thing, every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">He was short and walked slow. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And he was -- they said he was a vet. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And he went to check, every day he checked the milk and checked the -- the separators. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And, you know, would say hello, maybe a pat on the head, that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Would not interact. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Misha interacted more. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">So that's how we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">We - occasionally Misha would tell something about the news that's going on in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">We lost all hope of -- that we would be brought back. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">We knew that the -- so from Misha we knew that the Nazis were losing, that the army was moving forward, the Soviet Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">So I -- my brother worked in the <span class="DLF">gardens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">I don't recall what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I know what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Maybe he did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I pulled weeds. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I was -- pulled weeds from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">plants</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Somehow we heard -- this is actually 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I was eight years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">My parents heard, and I'm not sure how, that the Red Cross -- oh, I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Let me roll back. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">The -- we started hearing -- if you envision like this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> is round and down there is a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , and we heard shooting at night in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And we didn't know what it meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Did they -- were they gonna shoot -- were they shooting Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="526">We didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">We didn't know that the Nazis- that this was the partisans were doing that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">So we -- we learned that the Red Cross was -- this is probably -- should I give you a napkin? </span><span class="sentence" id="529">That the Red Cross was -- I think maybe from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Misha</span> , that the Red Cross was trying to save the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And they were organizing a -- a mercy transport back, kinder transport back to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> to save us from the -- because they feared that -- the general premise was that the Nazis would kill everybody in their <span class="DLF">path</span> back, and they (?</span><span class="sentence" id="531">withdraw’?) </span><span class="sentence" id="532">that they would kill the Jews and everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">So they wanted to save the children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">QUESTION: And who ran the collective that you were in? </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Was it run by the Germans? </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Was it run by the Romanians?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">ANSWER: Pardon me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">QUESTION:  Who ran the collective where you were working in <span class="COUNTRY">Kazakhstan</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  Well, nobody ran it really. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">It was -- it ran itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">The -- the commander, the Misha, was, you know, he said he was a Ukrainian and -- and the people -- the people basically owned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">The -- there was no guard in control. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And the -- the round guy was -- was just in charge of the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">So -- so it wasn't clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">We were basically free, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">We could starve on our own, die on our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">You know, we probably could have left, but you are in the -- on the corner of nowhere and nowhere without any money and you are in rags. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">So the Nazis -- as the Nazis were moving -- I mean the -- as the Soviet Army was moving forward, the Nazis were in retreat. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And we could hear a lot of gunfire, and we -- I can't remember whether somebody told my dad that this was the partisans, you know, that were hiding in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , and they -- they were shooting the -- they were destroying the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">So when -- when the Red Cross -- somebody told my dad at work that the Red Cross wants to take the children out, out of there, so they would survive. {</span><span class="sentence" id="551">Coughs} the -- my parents signed us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Well, my parents talked to us first, and I didn't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I felt that I wanted to stay with my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">My brother was not as vocal as I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Now, at this I must make a point that this Jagendorf, this guy, says he arranged it. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And that is a lie. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">That is not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">But anyway, they -- it was the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">He says with the -- he arrange it with the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">The Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">There was a lot going on that we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">There was a lot going on in the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> that -- that we didn't know about. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">They -- that they knew about. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">So they signed us up, and -- and in order to ensure, A, that -- that we stayed together -- that we get -- we get to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And he says this was for -- only for orphans. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">We weren't orphans. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">So -- but my parents wanted to assure that we would always stay together, so they made us twins. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">So they picked the birthdate, 1931, on November 28th, 1931, so they couldn't be traced back, and -- and signed us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">But then they were worried about -- also my parents were worried about that I was too young, somebody would -- so they -- they register us twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">If you -- hopefully I get the list, 1f not I'll chase the woman down. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">They -- they registered us twice; once as twins, and other times as both separately being 11 and 12 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Just to -- to, you know, sort of secure that if somebody can't take twins, they can take one. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Or if eight, they think will be too young to complain or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">So they registered us. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And you couldn't -- you couldn't be sent back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">You could not. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">But you could be sent any other <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Well, you know, where to send in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , you know, cold, but my -- only where we have friends and family. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">We -- my dad had done -- he had done business with Ford, with Auto Motora(ph), the Ford agency in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Botoshan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="581">He knew Mr. Bacall, who was a man by then would have been in his 50s or 60s, and he figured -- and Mr. Bacall also had two -- two sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So he figured they -- they -- if they're there, they'll take us. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And so he put them down to -- that's where we were going, to the <span class="BUILDING">Bacall's</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Botoshan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">We left around -- before Christmas -- and then when my parents a couple of times asked Misha, "What's the shooting up there?" </span><span class="sentence" id="585">He says, "I don't hear any. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Shooting? </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I never heard any." </span><span class="sentence" id="588">So, you know, we -- we just sort of didn't -- didn't press him. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">The -- but he would come in and say to us -- "Hold on, + -- just -- just stay." </span><span class="sentence" id="590">He -- he invited us -- so he said he was married to this farm woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">He invited us to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> once for dinner or twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And this woman was 20 years older than he was, which that's how it goes. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And had a nice -- you know, it was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Anything was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And so, you know, he -- but he always said "Just -- just stay and hold on." </span><span class="sentence" id="596">So would the round man, the vet. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And so we -- we -- my parents said you gotta go. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">So we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">We left. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">My dad rode with us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moghilev</span> in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> with horse, horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And somebody else, which I can't remember who the somebody else was. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Nota child. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">It was an adult. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moghilev</span> for -- for a couple of weeks while the transport was being organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And I cried a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I was heartbroken. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">My dad returned in that horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And of course, my parents were heartbroken. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">But that -- that was the general -- you are heartbroken when you are in a concentration -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nazi concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">We eventually made our way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Botoshan</span> in- in the spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">There were about 18 children that went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Botoshan</span> from other camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Jagendorf says that when -- when -- that he arrange it and the children of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Botoshan</span> have a welcoming for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">So we -- we arrived by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , by a regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And we were in like a large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and the people that were supposed to pick up children came, but so did a lot of other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">You know, just -- just to help, just to care {Crying}. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">So the Bacalls weren't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">It was circumstantial, because they were not notified and they were out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">But there were other people who said -- numerous other people who said, "We'll take care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">We will." </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And there was somebody in charge who decided who may and who may not, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">There was this family named Finklestein. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">A woman, she was I think 29. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">She had a brother that was 25. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">They lived with their father. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And they said, "We want them. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">We want them." </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And they had neighbors, a couple, and -- and two sons, like 18 and 20, and they said, "We want them. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">We want them. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">All of us want them. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">We'll take care of them." </span><span class="sentence" id="633">So we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">They were the most loving, wonderful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I mean they were so happy to have us. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">You know, we were dirty, we were probably in rags, and I don't really remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">They -- they fed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">They caressed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">They -- they were -- they put us to sleep in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I mean they were not people of means. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">They had a small -- little bit small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , but -- and -- and we were so excited, that the -- the son sat up all night and the neighbor, the Marcus, the name was Marcus, he sat up -- the two of them sat up all night to watch us sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">They were worried that if something happens in our sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And just the sweetest, kindest people. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And was fine for us, we -- we were happy to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">They cleaned our shoes, such as they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I don't remember what kind of shoes I had and what clothes, but they- they got us some clothes or they gave us theirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I don't remember nothing about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">I was just so taken by their kindness. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">That was just -- it was like -- like you're a dream, you know, you're dreaming about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And we stayed there for four or five days, and the Bacalls came back, and they found out that -- that we had arrived and they were not there and they were notified. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">They were not too happy about it and, of course, they also powerful people and they're also rich people, so they sent a chauffeur and -- to pick us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And, you know, the Finklesteins and the Marcuses, they were so upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And they -- they called somebody and they were trying to say -- and Mr. Bacall said -- you know, Mr. and Mrs. Bacall, these gorgeous-looking people, like something you see in the movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And they said, "No, they -- they -- their parents said they come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">They come here." </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Mr. Bacall, Sr. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">had died in the inter1m. And they had the Ford agency still. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And so, you know, money trumps a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">We stayed in touch with the Finklesteins though and the Marcuses. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">So they -- we stayed with the Bacalls for -- for several months. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">They were very kind and very loving, and I guess they bought us clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">I don't know where the clothes came from, but we -- they weren't the rags that we came with. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And it was a <span class="BUILDING">household</span> where there was a maid and -- and a chauffeur and butler. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">So dinner was formal and -- and, you know, you rang the bell if you wanted something, even to make the butler come from a long ways so he open the bottle. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And that -- we stayed there -- of course, when the Soviet occupied, reoccupied the Bukovina, the Bacalls lost their household help. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Apparently, the -- the maid and the butler had been communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I wonder why. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And so they -- they quit. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">But before -- before this, the occupation, the reoccupation, was not -- was not seamless. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">The Soviets bombed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and bombed -- it was a Seder, I remember the seder, and there were people and it was an elegant sort of dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And we stayed -- we went on the balcony and looking over, and then the alarm had gone off for the <span class="DLF">bomb shelters</span> , and there was a <span class="DLF">bomb shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="672">But before we could -- could process it, a bomb had hit the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And by the time we got to the <span class="BUILDING">bomb shelter</span> , the go-round, there were apparently a lot of victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And my brother insisted on going to help care for the victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">The men went, you know, to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And I think he was seeing the carnage, the blood and that kind of stuff, and he was severely affected by that. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So anyway, we -- we stayed with the Bacalls. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">The Soviets occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And then my -- one day, my mother had notified them that they are planning to get us. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And one day my mother just -- I could see her walking up. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">She had -- she had used an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Army truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">She worked her way up on an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Army truck</span> , and that was -- by then, that was- we had stayed with the Bacalls maybe six months already, five or six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And we went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I don't know whether on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I was -- we were so deliriously happy, I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and we didn't even know what -- what my parents found in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="687">What they found was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Our -- our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was stripped and our property was gone, and the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was -- somebody else was living init. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And like you didn't even want to start making demands. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">So -- but -- so what happened while we were gone Is -- is a story unto itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">So my -- my parents were -- absolutely you hear the shooting, and my parents were obviously very frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Every- the Glotters and the Steinvitzes, the other two families. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">So -- and Misha would come by or -- or the round guy, and say "It's okay." "</span><span class="sentence" id="694">Shooting." "</span><span class="sentence" id="695">Not shooting." "</span><span class="sentence" id="696">How? </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I don't hear any." </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Well, when the shooting stopped and when -- when Soviet Army had occupied -- reoccupied, Misha came in {Crying} to see my parents and the Glotters and the other people, and introduced himself as Moshe(ph) Wiseman, a Jewish colonel from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> , who -- who was a partisan. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And all those shootings were the partisans who were blowing up the -- the rails. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And -- and the round guy was a general. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">He was in charge of all the -- the -- the partisans in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">But this gave him a good cover. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">You know, they -- and the reason he was wearing this round coat was he -- he was carrying a weapon, a long weapon. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And he -- you know, they befriended the parents, my parents, and the other people and helped them leave, get transportation to go back to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And -- and, you know, it -- it seemed like -- like my dad was saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">When Misha said he's Moshe Wiseman, a colonel, and that woman he said was a good cover and she knew that -- who he was and what he was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And this -- this guy, they spent time with him and, you know, it's like -- like a novel. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">So when we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you know, my parents filled us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">And then my uncle, my mother's brother who had lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moghilev</span> , he -- he had been badly beaten, but when the Russians came in they -- all men had to be conscripted. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">So they -- they found a job for him and -- but he was very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">He -- they said he had a blood disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">We think he had leukemia. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And he came to live with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And we -- we had an empty two-room apartment and a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , a small <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , I guess, and the -- the -- the uncle when he came to stay with us, we had -- I think we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> that -- to sleep on, and I gave him my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span> , or maybe my mother told me to give him my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And he -- he stayed with us for a few weeks, and he died in January 1945, the day after my birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And he was lucid. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">He was lucid at my birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Wasn't any -- anything done. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I was nine, turning nine, and he -- but he told me I'm gonna grow up to be very beautiful, and I'm gonna be rich and educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And I think that took a lot of imagination because this scrawny little girl -- I mean I never became rich but I'm -- I'm okay, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I'm -- I'm no threat to -- to the millionaires, to Gates, to Bill Gates, but - so he died the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I don't -- there was no grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I mean you just sort of went there and you learned Russian --
QUESTION: How -- how old were you? </span><span class="sentence" id="725">How old were you at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="726">ANSWER:  Nine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="727">QUESTION: In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">ANSWER: In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">So the -- there were all sorts of ages. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">So -- because these were the return people and nobody had actually been schooled. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">So {Coughs} actually when I started, I think when I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- you know, I turned ten. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And I don't remember where I learned it, asked me what I want to be when I grow up. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I said I want to be an architect. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">I knew no more about architecture than -- than the cat, but it sounded like a good thing to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">So I don't recall what we learned, but we -- we went -- there was someplace to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And my brother had a different -- for just older kids, but the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And -- but then he became -- my mother's sisters and Uncle Jupiter had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">They didn't want to live under the Soviet rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">My dad had a job, I think again at the Meloche Trust, which 1s the -- the dairy trust. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And -- but we didn't have very much of anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">So -- and we -- and my uncle persuaded us, persuaded my parents to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> , to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="742">So that was another sort of using forged papers for -- so they used the -- the different birthdays, and that's how we got to be -- we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I -- I remember I was in -- still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> when the war ended in Europe May 8th, 1945, and there were thousands of thousands of people on the square in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And was a woman officer, you know, I never seen women in the Army, and she said, "This is a special day. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Today we -- we celebrate probelov(ph), free -- freedom and peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">So that -- that was awesome. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> a few more months and then went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And I don't -- we -- we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> , I think, on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="749">But the -- the -- with the fear of the documents always. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And it became now a fear of documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> in 19 -- sometime in 1945, and stayed there until 1946 when the -- when the -- or -- or later, maybe -- yeah, '46, late '46 when the Nazis -- when the Soviets were occupying -- you know, the king -- when the king was -- was being ousted, King Michael. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">It was becoming communist and it was gonna be communist, and Uncle Jupiter didn't want to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And my -- my parents -- my parents -- an aunt and cousin were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> already, and they felt that we should leave there because nothing good is gonna come. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">We should leave the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="755">So again, you sort of struggle and you -- you -- we lived in a one-room apartment or something in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> , like a <span class="INT_SPACE">studio apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And you struggled to organize documents and visas and all this kind of stuff. {</span><span class="sentence" id="757">Coughs} -- and in 1946, we were leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">We had a visa for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and a pass-through visa to the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">My uncle couldn't get a visa, so he just contacted smugglers. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">There were always these smugglers and -- Uncle Jupiter. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">So he paid somebody a lot of money and they -- on the -- the <span class="DLF">Hungarian border</span> was still the <span class="DLF">Hungarian border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="762">So the smuggler took him to this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> waiting for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , for the right conductor to be able to smuggle him over. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Well, it took a couple weeks and he still hadn't gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">So he said he would send for the women, when -- his wife and my other aunt when -- when he's on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">But then it had become communist already and you couldn't leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">So -- but the women had become anxious, so they -- they contacted the smuggler who tried to talk them out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">They also paid him a lot of money, and they left their -- their beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , all their possessions, and he took them to -- to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Now, these -- these people must have had a brain freeze, because 1n a -- in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border town</span> where everybody is -- is a peasant, and you see these beautiful two women, the one with the long blonde hair, you -- you immediately conclude that there is something going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I mean so when -- when the smuggler -- the smuggler didn't want to take all three of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">They talked him into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">He put them on the -- on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> or something, and of course they were all arrested, arrested and sent -- sentenced to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> for four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">But in the meantime, our -- we had these visas and we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">We left <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and went, and I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">We lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> for several months. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">But we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> for several months in 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And after that, we -- we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I stayed there until I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And I had -- so I didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="780">I had learned -- had some tutoring, you know, volunteer tutors. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">But I learned -- I taught myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">I was reading and writing and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And the same was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And then -- and when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , where -- where did we fit in? </span><span class="sentence" id="785">We didn't really fit in any particular. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">There -- there was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where, you know, we went every day and, you know, it was sort of teaching you life skills and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Intellectually, we -- we were self-taught. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> at the end of 1951. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">So I -- when I say I grow up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , I grew up basically there. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And, you know, it was a lot of sort of empty time, a lot of -- grew up fast, dating, older people, you know, was kind of -- And my brother -- my brother went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to study some kind of engineering, and he- he came here two years after us. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">He stayed there until he finished his course, his studies, and came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> in 1953. '</span><span class="sentence" id="792">52 maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">Yeah, in'52. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">It was only a year and some months in the summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And then he -- he went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and -- oh, roll back. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">He was drafted, and he was drafted a few months later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="797">QUESTION: By whom? </span><span class="sentence" id="798">By who? </span><span class="sentence" id="799">He was drafted by whom? </span><span class="sentence" id="800">By the -- who -- who drafted him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="801">ANSWER: The <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="802">He came on a green card and he was arrest -- he was drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">He was drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">He was multilingual, as I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">They didn't try at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">Don't have to now, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">So he was drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And the funny thing is my parents wanted to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , wanted to stay in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">But they were concerned that my brother would have to serve in the German Army, or in the European Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">They didn't want that. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">So lo and behold, we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="812">But once I got here, I had gotten used to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And my brother, once he came on a green card, was drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">So the -- but he was in basic training. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">The -- the colonel -- you know, my parents worried about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I worried about him, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">Because, you know, in the basic training in the Army is a lot of Mickey Mouse stuff, clean your weapon, put it together, take it apart, make your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , make -- shine your shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Well, we didn't think he knew how to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">He's very smart and would become a very successful man, but these things are a skill unto itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">So the colonel one day heard him -- started talking to him and said to him "Where are you from and what language do you speak?" </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And he says, "Okay, you're my aide from now on. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">I want to learn French." </span><span class="sentence" id="823">So he eventually was sent to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And I don't know if the colonel went, I don't recall, and he became part of the forerunner of the CIA. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">He was for the Army Intelligence. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">He was trained and they -- the Army Intelligence, he was -- he served the Army Intelligence. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">They gave him a different name. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">They put him in a <span class="BUILDING">private house</span> -- they -- they rented a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">East Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And he was a spy, basically, for -- for three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And he -- they wanted -- tried to persuade him that he should -- he could be this, you know, he was done with the Army, that he should do this as a -- as a job, that he should become -- take this on. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">But we try to -- we talked him out of it eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">But tried to explain to him, "Listen, they're not gonna send you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , they're gonna send you to <span class="REGION">Africa</span> or someplace." </span><span class="sentence" id="833">Well, anyway, he -- he went on to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and became a -- had a couple of degrees. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And his job, his longest job, was for 35 years at the Rand Corporation, The Think Tank. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">He's very smart, and he's very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And he died, unfortunately, 11-99. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">That's 14 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">So -- and I got married in 1952. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">I'd been here just months, here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> , and had no particular schooling, self-taught, learned -- I learned English by myself, self-taught. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , nobody learned English. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we attended to periodically didn't teach English. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">They just sort of kept you off the <span class="DLF">street</span> , I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">And I -- I taught myself English. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And I tell everybody the story that we lived in -- we had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="845">We lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and we had a maid, Anna Marie. {</span><span class="sentence" id="846">Coughs} -- my mother -- my mother took ill in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and she never basically recovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">She had arthritis. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And I think she was emotionally injured as well, but she had a severe arthritis. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And, you know, the meds that you take for arthritis sort of harm you as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">But so in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , people hadn't seen African- Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And Anna Marie, the maid, was in the <span class="DLF">park</span> and met a soldier that was African-American. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">So one day he came to see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">She told him she lives there. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">She didn't tell him she works there. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">So people saw him in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And oh, my God, what's gonna happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And he came to our <span class="DLF">door</span> and rang the doorbell. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and he said, "I would like to speak to Anna Marie." </span><span class="sentence" id="859">And since I spoke English, I could tell him she doesn't live here, she just works here, and she's not here. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">And spoke a few more words to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">It was all very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">He was a nice guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">But the -- the -- I was a star for the neighbors, because it was -- people were frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">They had lived through the war and -- and this was a strange sort of person, you know, and they just didn't know what to make of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And English was not spoken. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Nobody spoke English. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">So it was -- made me a -- that was my good deed for -- for the week. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">So there were a lot -- a lot of Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">My -- we -- my relatives that were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , my cousin, a physician, well-known physician, had in the meantime gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , so we really didn't have anybody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="871">So I mean my dad had a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I don't know what -- how good a job it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">It may have been less than he's used to. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And he provided for his family, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">And he -- so we also came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , not only -- but primarily because my parents worried that Armon would have to serve in a German Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">So that's what brought me to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="877">QUESTION:  What do you remember about how you and your family were received in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> as refugees or as survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="878">ANSWER: In the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="879">QUESTION: Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="880">ANSWER: Sort of half let's not touch them and half like the circus puppy or the circus performer. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">Half let's stay away, they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">But that's not only in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="883">That's Jews have done that, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">Jews that were not deported had the same attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">And -- and I had come to understand -- to observe that later, that -- that, you know, that's them and that's us, and somehow they deserved being deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">It was on the merits, not just on -- on some crazed anti-Semite. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">It was on some merits. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And that was one -- one part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And the other part of it was curiosity. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">Oh, you were in concentration -- you must -- and you look, you know, like everybody else, and so that -- that accounts for -- that sort of registered with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">That accounts for my never having wanted to talk about it, that I just didn't want -- I never -- I never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">My -- since I spend a lot of time in <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="893">You know, Spielberg has a show. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">No, I didn't -- and my brother was married to -- his first wife was - her father was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> , a studio man, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And he -- he wanted me to -- my brother I mean absolutely would not, and thought well, maybe she's not as adamant. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">So I- | -- that was in part, I didn't want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">I mean there is -- there is a population that -- that chose to, and I give them credit that chose to. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">I know Gerda Klein. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">Gerda Klein lived in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kenmore</span> , New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">So it was -- 1t was -- I give her credit. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">It was courageous. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">It was -- well, I don't know about being courageous, but it was -- {Coughs} it was an affirmative thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And it -- it brought attention to it, and she was okay with that, and her family was okay with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">In fact, my -- my former husband had a business with her husband, Mr. Klein, had a <span class="BUILDING">printing shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And my former husband was in advertising and, you know, did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And the Kleins had three children within the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , so at some point somebody collides. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">But I think that the Kleins, as a model, were not as accepted as you would think. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">They were respected but not accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">That's my interpretation. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Just because -- you know, I -- some people don't see that distinction, perhaps. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">I'm a shrink besides having a law degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">So the -- I think you can be respected without being accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And I think the Kleins were respected but -- accepted means you're just a regular guy, you're a regular woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">That's acceptance. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">If you are singled out for something that you had no choice about, or you had a choice about, that -- and people give you credit for that, that's not accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">That's respected. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">But accepted is all the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">So I -- I don't know if you see the distinction, but that's -- or you've ever noticed the distinction. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">But I -- so I -- I didn't put it forth that I am -- when people say to me "Where are you from?" </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Or you say more. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">In fact, I was a college professor at one time, and some of the students didn't -- you know, like they don't know accents. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">So they would say "Dr. Schafler, are you from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ?" {</span><span class="sentence" id="923">Laughter} "Or where are you from?" </span><span class="sentence" id="924">So, you know, I would say "Oh, I'm from some other <span class="NPIP">place</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="925">I didn't want to go into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">So the -- the -- I did not want to attract attention because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">So, but I don't think that Jews were as forthcoming as all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">They were not forthcoming in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And -- and the more you -- you look around, there were a lot of Jewish profiteers. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">I mean like -- like Mr. Jacobs was a profiteer in the sense that he earned money and he lived better and earned himself positions. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And I was reading a book not long ago about the Wrightmans. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">I don't know if the family name strikes you, but the Wrightmans are billionaire developers. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">They have developed half of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> or three-quarters of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And they are Hungarian Jews, and they bought their way out when -- when <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was going -- they bought their way out and they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tangier</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="935">So they -- so that they wouldn't be considered profiteers. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">Oh, and they went into money laundering. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">That's profiteering. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And there was so much money. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">There was no place to launder money other than in offshore. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">So they became very, very wealthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">So for -- for people that don't know, they said she -- that Mrs. Wrightman had a group of women and they were wrapping packages to send to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="942">Now, that is the stupid -- the second stupidist thing I've ever heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">I can't think of the first. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">The idea that you can send packages to the -- to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and they have mail call, and they say "Schmul Kahn(ph), there is a package for you." </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Are you kidding? </span><span class="sentence" id="946">So they -- and -- or -- or that the Nazis would have allowed packages to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or even Cariera de Piatra. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">That is too stupid. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">Oh, and -- and she -- they write -- probably self-written. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">I don't recall who wrote it. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">But they write that they -- they had difficulty sending them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="951">They have to send them through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="952">And the packages had chocolate, coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">Now, come on, give me a break. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">How ridiculous can you be? </span><span class="sentence" id="955">So the -- the -- they had dehumanized. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">They dehumanized the experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">If you think that -- that you can launder money for Nazis but you're sending chocolate -- chocolate to some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> somewhere, how dare you. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">So Jews did not -- did not do much, did not do much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="959">QUESTION:  When did you become interested in researching your own story and really piecing together your family history?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="960">ANSWER: ] -- I didn't -- I mean I know -- I knew some of it, you know, as I -- as I went along. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">I - the -- the Schafler side of 1t was done by somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">When my brother died, the -- the rabbi said, "Schafler, are you related to my best friend Schafler who was a rabbi in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="963">I said, "I don't know." </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And he showed me a picture, and he looked exactly like all the Schaflers. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">All the Schaflers are blonde, blonde, blue-eyed or green-eyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">They have perfect features. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">They all look alike, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">So I said well, this guy must be related to me because he looks like my dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">So anyway, he says, "Well, I'll -- I'll -- he died, but I'll contact his widow." </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And he contacted this widow, and she -- she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> at the time, and she had -- but they had lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> before, and then he been a rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> as well, and she had seven children. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">They're sort of all over <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and - and <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and whatnot. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And she started researching the Schafler family, and she sent me -- she would keep me posted, and she would send me all kinds of stuff about it, and she'd send me -- she'd send me like a matrix outlining who went where and who did what. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">But then one day she called me and told me that she's not gonna do -- and she had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and she talked to people and she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vishnitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="974">But one day she told me she's not gonna do that anymore because she's getting married {Laughter}. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">And she met this friend she -- who -- who died, and she met up -- she connected to her husband and she is marrying this guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">So what I know is what I -- about the Schaflers is she did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And I -- and I just have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">I benefited from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">As far as the Hollars, that's my mother's family, is what I know is just the one generation prior. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I -- I don't know very much beyond that. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">But what have come to me, what I have -- I never thought much about it, many -- for many years, I ignored the -- it's been too painful to evaluate the Jewish contribution to the Holocaust and to the people that suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">It's been too painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">But I have come to understand -- I don't understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">I just notice it. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">The Jewish people had been conditioned by religion that, you know, do what you're told to do by authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">No way could -- could ten Nazis with ten guns shoot 6,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">No way. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">So if they would have shot 200 people, 300 people, fully 5,700 or 4,700, whatever the math is, would have been alive, and -- and they offered no resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">My grandfather said "It's God's will we go" when they were ordered to -- to evacuate or get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="990">What I didn't -- what I didn't say is -- about what happened to the other people in Cariera de Piatra. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">The people were shot on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">They were shot just going to -- on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And those that survived {Coughs} were buried, were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babi Yar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="994">You've heard -- have you heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babi Yar</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Yevtushenko's poem and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">I have a -- a picture I'll show you later. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babi Yar</span> to see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babi Yar</span> a few -- ten years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babi Yar</span> was babi in Russian and Ukrainian means grandmother, and yar means a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="999">But so this at the time was -- was outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> so they -- the Jews were dropped off there and told to dig <span class="DLF">graves</span> and they were shot right into the <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">So nobody survived even for two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">That was the end of all the people at Cariera de Piatra is that they -- they were murdered there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1002">QUESTION: And how did you learn about that, the fate of that particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">Did you learn about that much later?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1004">ANSWER: Later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">Later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">Later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">Later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">Much later, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">We -- we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">I -- I learned about it much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And after Yevtushenko's poem, I wanted to go to -- to see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">Because we -- we had so many birthdates, my parents -- when my parents were alive, they were very worried about that, that -- that somebody will find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">They had been intimidated by -- by Nazis and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">And -- and they -- they had trouble coping with me because -- and so had my brother, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">And the interesting part 1s that he -- he had high security when he worked for the -- for the REC and they never discovered that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And -- and he had a different name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">Armon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">He was using the same initials, Armon, and I can't remember what last name they had given him, but Armon Schafler was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">So -- but -- so my -- when my parents were alive, they were always worried that somebody is gonna find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">What are they gonna do?

Jewish paper that it said Jews have no opinion about some political thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">Like why should they have an opinion? </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">I mean Americans should have an opinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">Why should they have an opinion? </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">So maybe -- maybe it's not as homogenized yet as I think, that that fear has -- has been left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">But then Jews don't speak out about -- about Jewish slight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">Jews were silent in the '30s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">Business was good, especially in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">It was after the Depression. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">And they were selling arms, and they didn't want to rock the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">So they were silent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">I mean having a demonstration in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> is not enough, so -- but this has come to me later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">When I married my first husband, he -- he was a staunch -- talked about Roosevelt, his whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">And Roosevelt sat with his lover he had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bethesda</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">You know, you probably heard that he had on the corner, like the second corner of <span class="DLF">Connecticut Avenue</span> , there is a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on the <span class="DLF">hill</span> and he used to go there every afternoon to meet his lover. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">And- and Jews didn't -- were not an issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">Jewish blood being wasted was not an issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">So that had come to me later when I -- when I started looking at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And for me that's what I like about <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">They're pugnacious and they -- they -- in a way they are like a four- year-old who's pugnacious but dependent at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> 1s dependent on the <span class="REGION">Western World</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">But at the same time, they're pugnacious, and they -- "Hey, I don't like this crap, yeah? </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">I don't -- I'm not gonna take this." </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">So -- but that has come to me much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">The fear of being Jewish has -- had persisted for a while.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1090">QUESTION: So why did you decide to tell your story now? </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">Why did you decide to tell your story now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1092">ANSWER:  Well, first of all, because I -- I no longer feel constraint by -- by my constraints. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">As I mentioned to you, when -- when the man spoke, and you can probably look it up in the -- who he was and -- look it up in the calendars, you know, I thought I'm not doing that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">I'm not looking at -- and, you know, all the people in <span class="REGION">California</span> , I didn't want to have anything to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">But -- but I -- maybe it's an empowerment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">I have empowered myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">This happened to -- to me despite what I thought, despite me being innocent, and now I can tell you about it and you didn't help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">You did nothing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">The -- the people that we thought were -- we were helped by the people that we thought were victimizing us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">The camp commander who hid, who said, "I saved as many of you as I could", and he didn't steal the money, he didn't -- he didn't bribe himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">He had the opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">And -- and the -- and Misha and the -- we never -- didn't know his name, the round guy, is {Coughs} that used to give us food and say "Don't worry about that, just hang in." </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">Just -- just -- or some days when there was a lot of shooting, he'd say, "Today is not a good day you should look out", you know, or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">But he'd come by almost every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">I can't remember a day that he didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">So these are the people that helped us that we thought were our -- our enemies, our -- that betrayed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">They didn't betray us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">They did what they could to survive themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">And in a way -- in the -- on the way of helping themselves, they helped others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">This is a huge risk for the camp commander to hide 400 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">This is a huge risk {Coughs}. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And -- and to sort of minimize it, and probably he was scared stiff, but he said, "Oh, there's nothing there, just old stuff." </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">So this is why I -- I feel empowered now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">I got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">What I didn't get before, I got it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">And I think it's a -- it's a moving story to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">It's -- it's -- this kid that didn't have any schooling went on to -- I started -- I took a course 1n <span class="BUILDING">college</span> in interior decorating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">That's what you did in the '50s, you decorated your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">And + went on would take maybe something else similar. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">But later I -- I heard -- I took a psychology class, and I was so enthralled by what the professor had to say that this was my -- going to be my life-long quest to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">So I went on and I -- [have a BA. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">I went on for a Master's, and I have a Ph.D. I have been in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for, I don't know -- in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , not -- actually for 20 years, yeah, and then I went for my law degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">I had -- I had 20 years of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">And when I started <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , you still had to take <span class="BUILDING">gym</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">So I had to get special permission, I do not take <span class="BUILDING">gym</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And golf didn't count. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">I used to play golf a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">That didn't count. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">I used to take ballet lessons for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">That didn't count. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">Had to be <span class="BUILDING">gym</span> , and I'm not sure what it had to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">I was just -- you know, I was way beyond that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">So -- so I have come a long way, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">I didn't become rich, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">I modeled in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">I have modeled for artists, for photography, you know, kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">I was a college professor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">I had my own psychotherapy practice and my own <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">Self-made. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">In fact, my daughter, my children, are highly educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">My daughter is a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">She's a distinguished physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">She was a rogue scholar and she -- they both went to <span class="BUILDING">Ivy League schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">And she was a professor at Penn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">Now she's a big wheel in a <span class="BUILDING">drug company</span> in -- drug company -- pharma company, Merck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">And my son is a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">He went to <span class="BUILDING">Columbia Law School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">And Ginsburg was his professor, Justice Ginsburg. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">So -- and even the next generation, the grandchildren, three of them at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> and one at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Williams</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">How -- how better can it get? </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">So -- so it -- it can be done, and I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">So now I -- I feel no -- no constraints. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">I -- if I'm not accepted, I don't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">I mean I might be respected, but I don't know that any -- any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> victims are accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">I don't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">I have not seen any evidence of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">I think that even those that have reached fame or wealth are sort of more like the circus entertainer than just -- just an ordinary person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">But that's my own view of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">Elie Wiesel is somebody who comes to mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">I mean he's not -- he's admired but he's not -- and respected but he's not accepted, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">I mean he's not a regular guy, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">To -- to be accepted, you have to -- you can be respected and be a regular guy, and he's not respected as a regular guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">So -- but I don't care now, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">I have accomplished a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And those that don't want to accept me, go away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1166">QUESTION: Is there anything else you would like to add that we haven't discussed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1167">ANSWER: I -- nothing that, you know, I haven't -- I'm trying to think what I wanted to tell about the camp story that I omitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">That to -- to illustrate the accept -- I felt as a child the acceptance versus the kindness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">And as I told you before -- and I think you may want to - to make a point of that, that -- I told you that the Bacalls were not there when we were, and there were the Finklesteins. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">They -- they accepted us, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">They -- they didn't do their duty to -- to some unknown whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">They accepted us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">We were children, and they -- we were special. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">And the way they treated us, you know, sort of -- we were dirty, I'm sure we were, and they -- they put us in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and they cleaned our clothes and they watched us sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">That's acceptance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">And -- and -- and they were poor but they fought for us, to keep us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">They were not poor -- I mean poor, I'm using it in relation to -- but they were not wealthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">And two more mouths to feed, I don't know that it was easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">But they were -- they were -- they wanted to share because they -- they accepted us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">So not a big -- the Bacalls were wonderful and all their friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">They had parties and physician there, and he used to examine us and he was their close friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">And they were wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">But then they were rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And the maid did most of it, and the chauffeur did the rest of it, so they -- it's easier kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">It was not -- they -- I don't think they accepted us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">They sort of a "noblesse oblige", if you know anything in French, that so -- that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">And I think that -- that the acceptance for minorities in general is just not what it should be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">It should -- just not what it should be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">I mean when -- when I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I thought being Jewish, being a Holocaust survivor, 1s like being, you know, a toddler, you grow up and you move on, but it isn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">Nobody -- you're not treated like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">So therefore, you internalize that you're not treated like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">We also thought that, you know, we -- we fought for the '60s and all the marches and stuff and we thought well, equality for -- for African-Americans, for black people would come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">And then you would just think well, this is another woman and she's great or she's awful or just another guy and he's great or he's -- didn't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">It didn't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">The -- so this 1s one of the reasons that I decided now to -- she's the one that is the survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">I mean when- when -- when Madoffs, the people that gave the money, you know -- you know, we all- you probably know, you saw the list, I'm sure you saw the list, you -- you think -- you thought to yourself how could people that have that much money be so stupid? </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">How could they not know what goes on? </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">How could they not know that -- that when everybody else pays 3 percent and somebody pays 10 percent that is illegal or -- or fraud. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">But people looked at Wiesel, especially, Elie Wiesel, and thought how could he do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">I'm sure you know he lost a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">And he said he didn't want to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">He feels that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">He feels that his -- his -- his burden is -- 1s higher than someone else's burden. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">You know, somebody else had lost that much money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">A lot of people spoke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">He never spoke out, because he feels that -- that he's not accepted, and for him would just be another piece of evidence not to accept him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">No, another reason not to accept him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">I had- | had wonderful childhood, you know, wonderful childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">That's not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">I had wonderful childhood until -- until -- but I had like Ruth, I had very good parents, wonderful parents, although they were more conservative and fearful as they got older and fearful because of what they went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">They were -- they were just -- we were their priority, and if we -- they didn't give us food when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was because there was none. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">And we didn't have to ask and say "How come we're not eating?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">If it would have been possible to get food, they would have gotten it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">So -- so this kind of total devotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">And I remember my -- when we came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Botoshan</span> and we were walking down the <span class="DLF">street</span> and we saw my dad come walking, {Coughs} coming towards us, and he hugged me and he said, "You came back to your poor old father." </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">And I'm thinking to myself how could he doubt it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">How could he doubt that we would come back? </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">You would make a choice you left luxury and you came to your poor -- poor old, poor father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">How could he doubt that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">That he -- they were very loving kind of -- if not dad -- my dad was more affectionate than my mother, but both of them had the priorities taking care of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">So -- so this -- this kind of thing gives you a basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">I didn't have to worry about that they would not protect my interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">So -- so you take this basis with you into life, this early -- or this -- this approval, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">I had come to -- to -- to- when you go through marriages and stuff like that, and you realize that only good parents love you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">Everybody else has a motive, wants you to love them back, wants to be married to you, uh, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">But only loving parents love you because they -- they wanted to have children and they -- they -- they feel the responsibility to do the best by you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">And when they led us -- they sent us away, they wanted us to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">If they couldn't assure their survival, they wanted someone else to -- they wanted us to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">So anyway -- yeah, I can think of -- the woman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ruth</span> , she -- she talks about -- I don't know if you are familiar with the book, but she talks about hers was a more modest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">They were sort of hand to mouth kind of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">And so any -- any bit of deviancy in life affected them immediately {Coughs). </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">So different experiences may have made her different -- her attitude different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">That's all I have to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">Interviewer: Thank you very much for your time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">Conclusion of Interview </span>
