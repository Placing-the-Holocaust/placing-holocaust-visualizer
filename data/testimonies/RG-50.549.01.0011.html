ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  I'm going to slate this tape by saying my name is Nina Ellis, and I'm interviewing Bella Tovey. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Today is Monday, June 10th, 1996. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">and we are at her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Silver Spring</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Silver Spring</span> , right, <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">| saw your video interview, and you talked a little bit about your memories of your liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And you were quite ill at that time, so a lot of it, | guess, is hard to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">But could you maybe start there with some of the events around that time that are most outstanding to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And how you remember that general period of time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Well, | remember -- okay, that's okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">| remember being liberated by the British. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">That is, | don't remember it, but | was told later that | was liberated by the British.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  What do you remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Do you know where you were that day and what your condition was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Well, | was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> in a -- | was one of the lucky ones at that point, because | had a -- | wouldn't call it a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Stop it for a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">| can't think of the name -- | had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> which | shared with another girl because what happened to me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , and | already -- | did say that, but maybe it need clarifying. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">That about a month before liberation, | was lucky enough to have been taken out of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , of the <span class="BUILDING">death barrack</span> that they called, where | was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> with many other women. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And | was taken out of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , thanks to my girlfriend, Frieda, about whom | also talked a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Who managed to get me out of that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> into a <span class="BUILDING">working barrack</span> , and it was there that | shared a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> with another girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And it was from that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> that | went to work, but for a very short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Actually, | had had -- by that time, | had had typhus, and when | came to this second <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where | was supposed to go to work, | came down with typhoid. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So that | basically worked for a very short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And then no sooner did | get of this typhoid, | came down with what they called paratyphoid. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">It must have been a repetition of that high fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And it was then that | -- as | was still sick with typhoid, | had fever and | don't remember much happening to me, that | was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">| do remember that my girlfriend, Frieda, came. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">She was very concerned about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Things were obviously going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">The British must have been very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Some of the SS men were trying to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Things were unsettled in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">| don't know it, but | remember being told. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">But my girlfriend, Frieda, who was in a different part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> because she worked as a runner for a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , worried about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">She knew something was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">She told me later she sensed that something was really wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So she came to see me, and | was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">| was feverish, | had not eaten, and | think | said that for certain more than a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And | don't think | had anything to drink for days on end. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">When people tell you that you can't live without food and drink, well, | managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And | wasn't the only one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">But anyway, she did come, | think she brought me some water. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">| think she managed to bring me -- she says she brought me some aspirin. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">| don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And she sat with me through the night, and, in fact, | do remember something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">As she came to my part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , | think they were trying to stop her. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Because somebody did -- she was shot, somebody hurt her. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And | remember that the only thing | remember is seeing Frieda and seeing blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">| saw a lot of blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">She told me later that it wasn't that she was bleeding so profusely, she was hurt in her arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">It was a very -- what is it? </span><span class="sentence" id="49">It was not a very severe wound. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">| think the bullet must have just scraped her skin or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And she had enough presence she just, you Know, put something around her arm, but it must have been red. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I saw her bleeding, and this | remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">| also remember people shouting that we are liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">| also remember that somebody tried to give me something to eat, and | couldn't eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And | Know now, | Knew later, too, that | was very lucky that | couldn't eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Because what happened is that British soldiers felt so sorry for the inmates that they gave them their rations, and most of the inmates in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> were not able to handle that kind of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And -- go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  Let me ask you to go back just a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Do you remember very much about that working <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> before you got sick? </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Can you tell me something about who was in there, what it looked like, wnat your average day was like right before you got sick? </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Because it was about a month that you were in there altogether, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  Oh, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">| remember the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">The <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was a long <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> on both sides. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">If you ever saw any of the pictures, it was the normal kind of a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">You walked in and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> were on both sides, and it was like a <span class="DLF">throughway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Like a <span class="DLF">corridor</span> in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> were double. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">You know, one on top of the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Very small, crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Two women, two of us sharing a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">We didn't have too much <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">If | had to turn around, my partner had to turn around. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">You know, we had to be always aligned. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So it was -- but it was <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> in comparison to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> from which | came where we were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and just some straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">It was just terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Of course, the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was also infested with lice, even the one | was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Because...
QUESTION:  Did you have any bedclothes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  We had a -- oh, yes, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">We had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">straw mattress</span> , and we had -- everybody had like a blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">| remember we had a blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">| remember it was dark gray. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">| don't remember exactly -- certainly no pillows, no sheets. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">But, as | said, this was <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Now, | went -- most of the people who were in this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And the work that | was taken to or was sent to was to sort clothing in a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And, of course, the clothing was the clothing that they had managed to bring from the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="89">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> mostly, because a lot of inmates in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen</span> had come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And this was mostly clothing that belonged to Jewish people or other people that were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And we had to sort things, socks and stockings and underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">All of it, by the time we got it, | think it was already washed. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And there was an SS man in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Every morning we had to get up, | do remember we had to get at about 5 o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Appell was at 5:30. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">| was given -- when | came to this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , | was given a uniform, a famous gray and blue striped. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Basically, what women were given. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">It's like a dress, not a jacket. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Men wore pants -- slacks and jackets, and we wore like long dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And underneath, since | was working in the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> , | was permitted the first day when | came, because | probably had rags by the time | got to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">But! </span><span class="sentence" id="102">was permitted to take from the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> a pair panties, | suppose maybe some stockings, maybe slacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">| don't remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And it was winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">A blouse and a sweater. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">| didn't have a bra, | didn't any bra. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">| was just as flat as anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">| was very skinny already. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">The way one could survive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> when one worked, and that's why the death rate on this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camps</span> was a little lower, was that you could steal something and exchange it. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So when | finally got to this <span class="BUILDING">working place</span> where that first day that | got my clothing, when | came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">home</span> meaning to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> -- | would, say, take off my sweater. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And the next day, | would just put on my blouse and that uniform, and that sweater stayed on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , let's say. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Or | sold it that evening for a couple pieces of bread maybe or a bowl of soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Then the next day, | would go to work, and when | was working, there was always a chance you could sneak in somewhere and get a pair of -- get another sweater and put it on and then | had something. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Unfortunately, we had a kapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">A kapo is a Jewish woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Actually, she was probably just a couple of years older than |. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">She was very pretty. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">She was not a like | was. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">| was very skinny, | looked like -- | was already at that point a walking skeleton, and | think she disliked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">She disliked all of us who looked so terribly bad, and | thought one day of trying to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I'm sure something was written about Jewish women -- of course, she was a bitch. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But why she was so particularly mean to me and those of us who looked so bad would probably make a good case study for a psychologist. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Was it that she saw in me what could happen to her? </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">There was another reason why she disliked me, and that was my own fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">The SS man who was in charge of our group sent her to get some books from a little -- there was a little <span class="BUILDING">office</span> where he had some books. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">He needed something. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Well, she was | think illiterate, or if she was not illiterate -- maybe she was not illiterate. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But she certainly did not read and write German. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">| don't know how good her Polish was. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">| didn't speak to her much. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">She was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , she came from a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">She was very pretty. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So he sent her to get the book, and she brought the wrong book because she didn't know how to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">But she didn't have the courage to tell him, "I don't read German." </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So he turned around and looked at me, and he said, "This little one looks smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Why don't you go and get me the book?" </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And | made a horrible mistake, and brought him the right book. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And she never forgave me for that, so as a result, what she did is the following day when we came on appell, she made me lift up my uniform to check what | missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And when she saw that | didn't have a blouse on, that | only had the sweater which is what maybe | was hoping to steal so | could have a bowl of soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Right away, whatever | sold and whatever | got for it | shared with my girlfriend, Frieda, always. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So she said -- she started beating on me, of course, and she said, "You're not going to take anything back with you." </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Even though this was a kind of a gentleman's agreement, everybody did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">She did it, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And so my career in that sense ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">| had an interesting thing that happened because of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I'm taking you to a different <span class="NPIP">part</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">The girl with whom | shared that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> was a cousin of Frieda's friend in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">When Frieda was taken out from that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , from that <span class="BUILDING">death barrack</span> , very -- originally, if you heard my story, you know that someone whose life was saved my Frieda's sister took her out of that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And she first didn't want to go, but she went because, of course -- that same, her name was Salka Longett (ph), the same woman who took Frieda out of the <span class="BUILDING">death barrack</span> took out another girl by the name of -- her name was Ruth, and | don't remember her other name now. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And Ruth was her girlfriend, so she also saved Ruth. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">| mean -- | don't mean save, but took her out that horrible <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where the death rate was the highest. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So when Frieda was able to get me to this <span class="BUILDING">working barrack</span> , that friend of hers, Ruth, with whom she became friendly now because they were working together in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , managed to get her cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And that cousin's name was -- | don't remember anymore, Franka (ph), Francis. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">She was a very placid, not very bright girl, and | think she was just not a very nice person. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">But maybe, maybe just not to me, | don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">She fared much better with the kapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">First of all, she was not that skinny. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">As | said, | think she was not that bright. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And she was managing to -- and she didn't get sick as | did shortly after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">But whatever it was, but she knew that all of us were bringing things. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">She didn't know that | was being picked on by the kapo, or she didn't pay attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">What she did do is that after the war, after | was already out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and now I'm going ahead of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">| didn't see my friend, Frieda. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">| fully expected her to come and see me, and she didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">She came to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> once, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">| don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">But just the relationship was not what it was, and so | went -- when | was already better, | went to see my girlfriend, Frieda. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And she was cold to me, she wasn't very pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">| don't know that | ever told anybody that, but | just remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So | said, "Frieda" -- we went out for a walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">It was already in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And | said to her, "Frieda, what's going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Why are you so uncaring? </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Is something wrong?" </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And she got very angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">She got very upset, and she said that Francis, the other girl, told her that | did not share with her everything that | was able to get -- you know, that | was getting, bringing some stuff and | was probably selling it and getting maybe some bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And | want you to know that Frieda was not living in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">| mean she was working in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , but she was hungry from -- | mean there was just no question that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> was a horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> , even if you work. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And she said that she was very hurt when she heard Francis tell her that | did not share, because this was -- you know, we were like sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">This was an agreement that -- we didn't write anything to each other, but this was a given. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And she said to me that that's what Francis told her, that | did not -- that | basically cheated on Frieda. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And | got terribly upset, | remember | cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">We had a long talk, and we made up. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">She believed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I'm grateful to this day we are still friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">In fact, | just saw her in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">But so | had this terrible experience, but it was this Francis with whom | shared, that bum. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And it was this Francis who | remember, because she did not get sick as | did, when | was so sick toward the end of my stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> that she just was just a very uncaring person, at least as far as | was concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So...
QUESTION:  The close relationship that you had with Frieda was clearly very important to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Was that -- did other women have close relationships like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  That was very important to many of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Very often a relationship such as this was was there between, let's say, two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">If some of them were lucky and they had a mother and daughter, but usually two sisters, two cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Interestingly enough, not always did the two sisters get along. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">It was not always, but many of us did form these kind of relationships, and it was extremely important for all kinds of reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">| mean not just -- first of all, it was important to survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">When we were on the death march, when Frieda couldn't walk, | dragged her. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And when she didn't want to get up, | pushed her. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Or | couldn't -- and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , if it wouldn't be for Frieda, | probably wouldn't be sitting here and talking to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">There's no question that she saved my life, and | don't think this was true just for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">We had a lot of us formed these kind of relationships. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">| know that Henry, my husband, had a kind of -- actually, he was with a group, but he had one friend who | didn't even know about, because Henry doesn't talk much. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">But we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> a couple of years ago, and we were staying with one of his friends with whom he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and in the camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And his name is Jacob, and they were awfully nice to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">We had a tour, but then we stayed a couple of days with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And Jacob told me for the first time, | didn't know, that he's alive because of Henry. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">That Henry literally carried him during the death march. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Henry never told me that, but these things were happening to a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">This was very important to have somebody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  Once the British came and you started to get your health back, you stayed there because it became a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> ; is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">QUESTION:  How did -- what was your life like there, let's just say, for like the first three months or so of that summer of 1945?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">ANSWER:  I'm trying to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">| probably came out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> -- | was liberated on April 15th. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">| have no dates to give you, | don't remember when | was -- they probably took me out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> as soon as | was not contagious. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Because when | was taken to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , | had paratyphus, but | was already lucid. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">|, for instance, remember being taken out, not fully, but | remember that they put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> or something, since the sick people went first. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">But | do remember being sprayed with DDT, | always talk about it; it's such a wonderful feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And | remember that the <span class="DLF">air</span> , when we're driven out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , the <span class="DLF">air</span> smelled so sweet once we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">But | don't remember how long | was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">It was not probably a very long time because | think that it was already in May | was already in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> , actually, you probably know about it, was formed in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> , not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> had -- these were army, this was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">army camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And what the British did, is that they took over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German Army camp</span> , and they turned it into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">The Jews were not the only inmates there. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">They had Russians -- | don't think there were too many Poles there, meaning non-Jewish Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">There was Polish, but no Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">They had men and women, but they kept the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> separately. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So | was put in, | remember | was in Block -- if I'm not mistaken -- <span class="BUILDING">Block Number 73</span> , which was one of the blocks where the women were put. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And what they would do, we were given a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , the blocks was a two-story <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">| don't remember how many <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> were on each <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , but | do remember that we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and showers on one <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and then one -- so | have no idea how many. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">| don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">| do know that | was given a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on the second story, <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> with this Francis. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Probably because | came out with her, and | very quickly moved out. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">| didn't want to share with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">There may have been somebody else in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And | meta very nice girl who was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , who was about five years older than |. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And | actually came to borrow a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">frying pan</span> from her, | wanted to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And we became very friendly, and she took me into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where she shared with three other women. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And so we were five of us in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and we also had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , but these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> were now private. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">| had my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , and there was one above me and there were five or six <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Because | think eventually, we took in another girl, and the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> had -- so we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">It was a good-sized <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And then there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> , | suppose, for clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">People had clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And then, of course, if we wanted to wash and shower or use the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , there was one big communal. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">| suppose this was the way soldiers lived in these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , so that's -- it was summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">We were coming out from a bad situation, we had food. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">It was not wonderful food, but we were -- I'm trying to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">We probably were given all the bread we -- we had enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">| remember for the first time not being hungry, which means that we were given soups. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">| think ONR moved in rather quickly and provided, they had big <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">We had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> to pick up our -- | think, midday soup meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">In other words, we were given soup and probably bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">| don't remember anything more than that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">QUESTION:  What did you do during the first few weeks? </span><span class="sentence" id="258">What did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Were you strong enough to go out? </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Could you leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">ANSWER:  | don't remember leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">| think what we did in the beginning, we were trying to -- | have all kinds of memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Well, the first thing that we tried to do is to find out who was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">| remember going to the -- there was already probably something, a <span class="BUILDING">community center</span> formed. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">In fact, there was one. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">In fact, if you ever heard about Hadassah, Gross Rosen, her husband, she by that time was not married to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">She comes from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Her name was Hadassah Binka (ph), | think it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">She was a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">She survived, she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">| think her husband-to-be, much older than |. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">If not much older, certainly he was an adult before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So there must have been Jewish who formed some kind of a community, and maybe they were the ones who worked with ONR to start bringing things. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So | remember going there probably, and trying to get lists of people who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">My girlfriend, Esther, started volunteering in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">| probably took care of things in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Maybe | was the one. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Because everybody was doing something. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">| was probably the one who would go and get the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">| was probably still weaker than the other girls there because | had come out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , and they were not -- they came directly from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">There were some, | have a memory of sitting on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So | think that behind the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , there may have been some <span class="DLF">lawns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">We probably would sit around and talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">We probably talked a lot about what happened to us and about our family and whether we're going to find anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">That was in the beginning, | had a very difficult then with my girlfriend, Esther. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">| found Frieda, remember | told the story what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">She was already at that point sharing a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with some other people with wnom she was, so we never -- we did not get back together that way, because | had found Esther. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">But our relationship was great, that was the problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">| was -- my girlfriend, Esther, was very hopeful that her boyfriend survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">She came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , and she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , she was an only child. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">But she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with her parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">She was separated from her parents, but managed to go through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with her boyfriend's mother and sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">They went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> together, they ended up at some, | don't know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="294">| think they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , but | don't remember, and they ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And my girlfriend, Esther, who as | told you was about five years older than |, that she mothered me because, you know, | was -- in 1945, | was born in 1946, so | was 19 right after the way, not quite 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So my -- no, | wasn't even -- wait a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">| was born in 1946, | was not even 19; | was 18, going on 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  Let me turn the tape over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">QUESTION:  This an interview with Bella Tovey. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">This is Tape 1, Side 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">ANSWER:  So what happened to her that she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , talking about my girlfriend, Esther. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">With her boyfriend's mother, and she was practically engaged to be married to this guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Having been five years older than |, she was -- | know that she graduated from <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">She was born in 1921, yeah, so she was about five years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Anyway, she buried that future mother-in-law and her boyfriend's sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">In other words, they didn't survive, but she had hoped that her boyfriend survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">She had heard from somebody that he was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with his brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And then, must have been about a month after the liberation, maybe a little longer, but | remember that we were together in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with the other girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And somebody came with the news, must have been a friend of her husband -- of her boyfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">In fact, it was a friend, | remember, who was his friend and told her that -- his name was Manik (ph), | don't what, the Polish name was Manik, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">That he was killed a day -- he died or something happened a day after liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Just a day after liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And my girlfriend, Esther, went into what | now know, into a deep depression. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">She refused to get out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , she stayed in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And | was very concerned for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And | do remember that | would sit and | would sing to her for hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">The other girls, we all tried to take care of her, but | was the closest to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And | would sit there for hours, and | would sing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">QUESTION:  What would you sing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">ANSWER:  All kinds of songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Polish songs, anything that | remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">| came from a bit of singing family. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">My mom had a beautiful voice, and we always sang at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So | sang whatever, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And | would try to make her eat, and friends came. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">In fact, Henry, my husband, who was not my friend then, but he knew Esther because he comes from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And they were together in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the same <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Anyway, | remember he would come and bring some goodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Men always managed to bring some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">They managed to -- he probably already was getting out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> occasionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">But | don't remember how long it lasted, but | think that what | did then and | talked to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And | would have a talk to help, and then -- originally, first, of course, she was talking about her boyfriend and Manik and what friends they had and how much she loved him and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">But then | would -- today, | suppose | could say that maybe | acted as a therapist. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">But | didn't have any schooling, | just did something instinctively trying to help her. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">So | started to ask her to tell me about life before the war, what she did before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">What <span class="BUILDING">school</span> she went to, who were her friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And then she told me that she had a boyfriend before the war, that she had a boyfriend, and they were kind of like childhood sweethearts. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And in 1939 when the war broke out, her boyfriend, whose name was Lolak (ph), and his father -- his father was a professor at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Gymnasium</span> , and they knew because they were intelligentsia that they're going to be -- they were in anger. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">They were told that the best thing for them is to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">At that time it wasn't because he was Jewish, this was when the Germans were removing the Polish intelligentsia, and among them, of course, the educated Jews, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">So Lolak's father, his name was Seka and Lolak decided to run away to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And they came to Esther, and they wanted her to go with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Lolak, her boyfriend, was a year older than Esther, and he graduated from the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Gymnasium</span> in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">He was accepted at the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , but he waited for Esther, who was also accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And they were going to go in 1939 to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but they missed it because war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So they were really serious about each other, and he wanted her to go with him to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">But she was an only child and she couldn't leave her parents, so they parted company and he escaped to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> with his father. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">When she started to talk to me about Lolak, | Kept going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lolak</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Whenever she would mention her boyfriend, then apparently life took its course. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Lolak was in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , she was a very pretty girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">She met this guy in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and they became close and had he survived, I'm sure she would have ended up with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">But | just wanted to know about all of that, and | made her talk to me about all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And | was singing to her, and she was so -- | think that | probably spent probably the rest of that month, May, maybe into, | would say -- | would say that it took about maybe a month to get her back out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And she did get out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and she went back to work in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where she had started before she decided that life is not worth anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And | want to tell you that -- two things: Number one when she came back, when she came back to herself, somebody came and told me that my father is alive and was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">| had...
QUESTION:  That's your...
ANSWER:  My father. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">That somebody by the name of Aaron Nakabovich (ph), that's my father's name, is alive, and he should be somewhere in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Now, | had not seen him on the list, but somebody said that they saw him on the list. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">| did find my sister at that point -- no, | didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">| Knew my sister had a chance to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">No, | didn't know anything about my sister, but | put my name on the list. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And when | heard that my father is alive, | decided to go and look for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Now, this is an interesting story. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Because what happened is that traveling through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that point was impossible, but people did. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">We were looking for people, so the first thing that was necessary was to outfit me for the trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And my girlfriend, Esther, who was not a wonderful thief, stole -- | didn't have shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">| had like cloppers, it was summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And | probably had some clothing that the ONR gave me, but where I'm going to go on a trip, | need something a little more decent than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">A warm jacket maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Evenings in Europe, even in the summer, are cold, colder. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">So she stole shoes, two shoes for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">But they were two left shoes, they were, you know, kind of like, you know, like shoes with lace. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Good walking shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">So she stole them, or organized them as we used to call it in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Somebody gave me, or maybe | had a pair of slacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And then another girl -- the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> got together and they outfitted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">So! </span><span class="sentence" id="379">got a pair of slacks and | got a nice shirt and a shirt to change, and a sweater or a jacket, and even a kerchief. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And Esther was telling me how to, if | need to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or | need to step down or something, since I'm wearing slacks, you can't tell that they are two left shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">But if | always step out with my left foot, then nobody will notice that | have two left shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Managed very well with these two left shoes, so | went, but | didn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">It had to be arranged. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">| didn't go alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">| went with, actually, Henry and a friend of his, because they had had pneumonia and they were being sent to a <span class="BUILDING">sanitorium</span> just to make sure that it doesn't develop into something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">So they were going to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="BUILDING">sanitorium</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , and | wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , so | went with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And it was an experience, because you couldn't buy tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">You had to -- some of Henry's friends literally carried us and threw us into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that was leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">| don't know how we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">| Know how we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Henry had a friend who was already working for the British, he spoke English. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">So he managed to borrow a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">So the three of us, with his friend -- his name was Alexander, took us to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="394">We went from -- and a couple of his friends must have gone along, because | remember being thrown into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> through the <span class="DLF">window</span> , okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And somehow the three of us got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went to the -- stopped at the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Because, you see, we're in the <span class="REGION">British zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">So we had to get through to the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> , but this was the beginning of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">The soldiers were very sympathetic to us, they knew who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">All we had to do is tell them that we are Jewish, DP, you know, people -- refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And the Americans let us through, we didn't have to -- later on that became much more difficult, but at that point, it was easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">| do want to tell you this, and this was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">The American and the British, | don't know about the Russian soldiers were extremely nice to us in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">When they shipped the <span class="BUILDING">American boys home</span> , and they knew the young -- | don't know -- the young, they knew what Americans, | suppose, wanted to do and maybe the British did the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">They wanted to send the war-weary soldiers <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so they sent them <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And then when the new soldiers came in, those who didn't see the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , those who didn't see what we went through, they started fraternizing with the frauleins, with the German girls and they were much nastier to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">They were not so understanding, it was much harder. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">It was painful, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">So that's -- but, you know, | remember at that time being very angry about it, but | now understand why a little better. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">But anyway, | went through, we went through to the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="410">| got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , turned out that this was not my father, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">But when | came back, oh, | also want to tell you -- | also want to tell you that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> wasn't always -- then one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that we took on that was really funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">We had -- <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was devastated. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> were bombed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> -- the trip that should have taken maybe, | don't Know, 10 hours, we were traveling for a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">We would stop in <span class="NPIP">places</span> , we would stop in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> , some Jewish inmates would take us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Then we would go farther. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">It was a whole undertaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">| remember being, for one stretch of the <span class="DLF">road</span> , we hitched -- we managed to hitch- hike or something, | don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">We managed to get on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that carried oil or gas, because they were those round -- what do they call them? </span><span class="sentence" id="420">| suppose, trying to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">They looked like a big, round barrel, and you couldn't -- there was no way, and the only thing it had like a little <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> in front for | suppose the conductors. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And | remember Henry and | and his friend, we were sitting on one of those little, it looked like a little <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">QUESTION:  Was this the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank car</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">ANSWER:  It was like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> , but it was like a round. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And in front on both sides, it had these- there is a name for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">It looked like a little <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> , but it wasn't a <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> , with the little <span class="DLF">railing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And | suppose you could stand on it, or if you were weary, as we were, we would sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And since it was night, we would hold onto the <span class="DLF">railing</span> , and since it was night, we would doze off. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Because | remember occasionally, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were moving very slowly, but nevertheless, | remember once in a while kind of feeling that I'm sliding down. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">| Suppose when you're young, you don't worry about it, but it was not always the safest way of traveling but we did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And, as | say, | did get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , but by that time | had parted company from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And, you know, | don't recall how | got back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , because that was probably an experience; | was alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">But again, what was helpful is that if | met some Jewish -- | remember getting on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , and | don't remember how | paid for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">| think what probably happened is that somebody -- | said something, and somebody said to me, "Am who?" </span><span class="sentence" id="435">It means -- it was kind of a Jewish password, which meant are you from my <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> , are you from my people? </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Because there were a couple of guys who | think paid for me and asked me where | was going. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And | was telling them that | was looking for -- | had an address, but it was already in the evening, so they suggested that they would take me to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , to wherever they were staying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And it's funny, there were two guys; | didn't know them from Adam, and | said, "Okay." </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Well, | had no choice anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">| could have, | suppose -- to stay on the <span class="DLF">street</span> would have been ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">They felt that it was too late for me to get to where | was going, so they took me with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And | think they had some kind of an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , they must have gotten an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> from a German family. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And they gave me a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and there was no other -- there were just the two of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">You know, when | think about it, they could have raped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">It doesn't matter, they actually they were very nice, they gave breakfast. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And | think they even took me to where | needed to go, and then | found that my father was not alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">But | found a cousin, a distant cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Who was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="449">My mother's cousin, who was younger than my mom. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Anyway, she survived, and she already had a boyfriend or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Because | remember she gave me some money, she gave me some clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">| don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And she told me that my sister's alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">So that was great news, so | somehow managed to get back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> , to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And I'm trying to remember how | got back there, but | don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">| probably took the same, you know, chance with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">QUESTION:  Why did you go back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">ANSWER:  To <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">ANSWER:  Because that was my base. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">| had no intentions of not going -- if | had found my father -- | didn't leave for good. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Even if | had found my father, | would have gone back. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">| would have gone back to see how Esther is; | had made friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And they gave me clothing, not all of it was mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Besides, it was my base, but | went back, so | went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Also, | knew that if my sister is alive...
QUESTION:  Did you never think about not going back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  From where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">QUESTION:  From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="469">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> was also in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">ANSWER:  And who wanted to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="472">| didn't have anybody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">There was no reason for me to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">That cousin, maybe she even offered to keep me, | wouldn't have. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">| didn't Know her that well. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">| felt much closer to the people | had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> , so -- but | also knew that if my sister's alive and | was registered on the list, then she would know that I'm in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And this is what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">When | came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> , it must have been already early July. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">My sister was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">She had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Now, she was liberated by the Russians, and because she was liberated by the Russians, she was sent -- the Russians sent most of the people who could walk, they sent them back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482"><span class="BUILDING">Home</span> , for my sister was <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szydlowiec</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where | was born, and that's where my sister went. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And she didn't stay there that long because she was alone and she met with some unpleasantness. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Some Polish neighbors were extremely nice to her, and then she walked out into the <span class="DLF">street</span> and some s.o.b. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">said to her, "So Hitler left some of you." </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And my sister decided this is not for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So she went to another- she found another cousin who, by the way, is my cousin whom | knew much better and stayed with her for a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And when she found out that | am alive, she decided to smuggle herself to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And she did come with an aunt of mine, who also wanted to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">So she, my sister, and my aunt -- this was mother's youngest brother's wife, who had lost two children but survived with her niece. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And she and her niece and my sister, which was a niece on her husband's side, they managed to smuggle themselves through to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">That was a little more difficult because you had to go through the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> , you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And but | have a feeling that my aunt who was an adult, she had been married before the war, she had two children, she may have had some money with her already. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And they managed to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> and to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> , and my sister found her way. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">She knew where | was, and when | came, she was in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with, you know -- and, of course, we took her in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">QUESTION:  Do you remember coming into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> when she was there the first time? </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Do you remember the meeting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">ANSWER:  | probably -- you know, it's funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">| remember that | couldn't recognize her. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">She was also very thin. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">By that time, some of the girls started to gain weight. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">It took me a much longer time to gain weight. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">| never got real heavy, but | already looked a little better. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">My sister was still very thin, and she was -- she's little. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">My sister was only 16, she was a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And -- so | think | was in a state of shock when | saw her. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">She looked so vulnerable, you know, so small. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">But she's not a vulnerable person, she's very strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">She's a strong woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">She was even then strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">It was wonderful to have my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And then, then we had some rough times because we, you know -- well, first of all, | had to tell her that | thought that my father's alive and he isn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">So we cried about that, and it was a mixed thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">It was good to find her, it was probably wonderful for her to find me. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">But, you know, until my sister came, | remember we were looking for things, but we were in a kind of a -- it was kind of a never-never land. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">| don't know how to explain it. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">With my sister's coming, the reality that this is it, the two of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And at that point -- and at that, | was lucky, | had a sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">There were some of us who Survived all by themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">The reality set in that this is it, that I'll never my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">That I'll never see my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">That I'm never going to see my kid sister or my kid brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">That was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And in that sense, | think that was hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">We also started to fight, and we fought mostly because of ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">She was going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">She came in, she had been -- when she was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> until she came, she was involved with a group of young people who were being already -- | don't want to use the word "indoctrinated," but yeah, they were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">QUESTION:  The Zionist group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">QUESTION:  What was the name of the group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">ANSWER:  | don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">| belonged to a Zionist organization during the war, it was Dror. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">It was probably the general Zionists. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">| was not opposed to going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , but | had a fight with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">The reason was simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">When she came, she also brought a letter from my uncle here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">| had four uncles in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and after the war they were looking for family. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And when she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szydlowiec</span> , she found letters from my uncle written to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> asking whether anybody by our name from our family is alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So she managed to get the letters and the address. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And when she came, she brought all of it so that we could write to our family and tell them who we are and where we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">So | said to my sister, "Nina"...
QUESTION:  Her name's Nina?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">ANSWER:  Nina, her name's Nina. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Her name actually was Piena, but when she came -- Piena, | don't know how she got the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Her name was Sabena, but when she was little she couldn't pronounce her name, and when people asked her what her name is, she probably said, "Piena." </span><span class="sentence" id="545">So the name stuck, and we called her Piena. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">When she got to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , she found out that Piena means corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Well, she wasn't going to be called corner, so she changed it to Nina, that's how -- but anyway, my sister and | started to argue, because | felt that we had four uncles in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and we should go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">If we don't -- oh, there was another reason, and | do have to be honest about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">If we were permitted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> -- and when | say "we," | don't mean just myself, | mean most of the survivors of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">At that time if they had opened the <span class="DLF">gates</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , | think that 90 percent of us would have gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">There would have been no question about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Given what we went through, all of us felt that this is the <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">So | didn't have any quarrel with her on that subject, but | was looking at reality and my sister was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">The British were not letting anybody in, and it didn't take much time for us to find out what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And | didn't want to enter already. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">| needed -- you asked me why | wasn't getting out. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Except for the trip that | took, | stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I'm beginning to think -- | wasn't interested in getting out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> because | couldn't stand to see German children. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">| couldn't stand to see German -- | hated -- | hated the kids because they were not my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">| was very -- | Knew it was probably a very normal feeling for a lot of us, and | didn't like those feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">| didn't want -- | needed to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and | kept saying to my sister, "We have a chance to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="562">My uncle wrote us immediately that he's already applying. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">That as soon as they permit anybody to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , we will be the first people to get the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">My uncle was very wealthy, and he wrote; he said he has contacts. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">He's going to make sure that the <span class="DLF">Polish corridor</span> was after all open. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">He was going to make sure that his nieces -- we were the first ones that he found out that we were alive -- that his two nieces were going to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">So | knew that we can go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and | Knew we can get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And | said to my sister, "Look, if things change in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ," in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , it wasn't <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , "we'll go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="569">| agree." </span><span class="sentence" id="570">| said to her, "You are my younger sister, I'm older. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">We're going to do what | say." </span><span class="sentence" id="572">This is what | thought | have the right to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And she -- well, first we fought because she said to me, "It doesn't matter what you're saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">| am not going anywhere but <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Nobody will send me to another <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="576">She was absolutely convinced that if she goes to any other <span class="NPIP">place</span> but <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , the same thing that happened to her parents is going to happen to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">She's not going anywhere, forget it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">QUESTION:  Did a lot of people believe that way, or...
ANSWER:  Oh, she wasn't the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">As | said, look, most of us would have gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Some of that feeling was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">| didn't come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> with a feeling that this is the best <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">| came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> because it was better than being in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">| mean, | wanted to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , | would have gone to the moon. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And | definitely would have gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> if | could, but | couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">So the fights between us -- and that's kind of, it took its toll. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">So what did | do? </span><span class="sentence" id="587">There was no point fighting her. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">| figured she's only -- she's a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I'm going to take care of the two of us, and we'll manage. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Fortunately for me, my girlfriend, Esther, went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to see what's going on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">She took a trip, she brought some pictures back. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Talking about my girlfriend, Esther. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">She came back and she decided she needs to -- gee, | didn't know | had that much to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">She decided that she knew that she probably could go, get to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> legally, because she was accepted at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> before the war and she had family in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">But she also knew that it would probably be better to be in the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">So she managed -- and also, things were easier in the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="598">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen camp</span> was not an easy <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="599">When winter set in, we were cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">We were not so very well taken care of, | found out later. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">So she managed to get over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szczecin</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , which was close to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> and sent for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Well, | wanted to take my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">There was no talking to my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">My sister by that time had joined a Zionist organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">She was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , she was learning Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">But | decided okay, so | said to her, "Look, I'm going to go see what | can do." </span><span class="sentence" id="607">So | went over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szczecin</span> , it must have been about November of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Don't ask me what | did in between there and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> ; | honestly don't remember, honest. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">But |! </span><span class="sentence" id="610">did go to -- as | said, | went <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szczecin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">In fact, Henry came to get me. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Again, he was just a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">He was a very good friend of Esther and he had at that point enrolled at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">He was already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szczecin</span> , he was studying medicine at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Frankfurt</span> , and Esther asked him to come and get me. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And so he came and got me and | went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szczecin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">When | came <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szczecin</span> , Esther already had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that rented with a German family, and it was moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And | found work, | started working through Henry who had a girlfriend whose sister worked in the Hias. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">My husband had a lot of girlfriends after the war, but that's okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And then -- so | started working the Hias. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Well, you know what the Hias is, and when | went to work to the Hias, there was -- again, you see, | was very, what do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="621">What's the word? </span><span class="sentence" id="622">There was one thing on my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">| wanted to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">| was just concentrating on one thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">QUESTION:  Very focused.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">ANSWER:  Very focused. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">| certainly was. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">So | was working the Hias, and hoping that this will help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And, indeed, the first papers that came to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of Hias were for me and my sister from my uncle who later | found out, as | said, he was a very wealthy man. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And he probably was able to get his congressman to send through the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Whatever it is, my papers came in first. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And then, of course, other papers came. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">So | knew that I'm going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Now, what do about my sister? </span><span class="sentence" id="635">In the meantime, | was going back and forth to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">First of all, when | came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szczecin</span> , | registered myself and | registered my sister, as if she -- because she had to live in the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> to go to American. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So she was registered, the papers were written, she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">| brought her once or twice to visit me when | went there, but God helped us, we were called to the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And first, | think to the doctor for examination, so | brought my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">| don't remember how, somebody brought her; she came. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">She went with me to the doctor, she went with me to the <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And we were issued probably already the permission, the papers to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and we were supposed to wait for tickets because at that point nothing was yet leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">This must have been March. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Now, my sister went back, and she said that she needs to take care of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And we were waiting to hear, and | think that | got -- when | -- | don't remember exactly how | heard... End of Tape 1. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Tape 2
QUESTION:  This is Tape 2, Side 1 interview with Bella Tovey. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I'm Nina Ellis. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">It's June 10th, 1996.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">ANSWER:  On one of those trips back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> when | was trying to get my sister to either come or go, | found a letter written to Esther from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lolak</span> , her first boyfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And | remember | ran like -- | don't remember, but | made it back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szczecin</span> within a short time, and | brought her that letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">He was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">He had survived in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> with his father, and | was the one who brought her that letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">That must have been sometime early in 1946, maybe February, one of those before. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And then | remember, of course, that | kept saying to Esther, "I have to wait till Lolak comes. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">| have to meet him." </span><span class="sentence" id="656">| never did then, because what happened is that we were issued tickets, and the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , | think, came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in April or later April. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was supposed to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremerhaven</span> , that's the port of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , | think on the 10th of May. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Because | came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> on the 24th of May 1946 on the second <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="659">In between, my sister while | was running back and forth said to me, "Bella, I'm not going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">We are leaving in two days." </span><span class="sentence" id="661">That must have been April, still late April, and | already knew that she's supposed to come with me, too. "</span><span class="sentence" id="662">I'm leaving tonight or tomorrow with Aleah Allah (ph) to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="663">She was 16 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">The bill that Truman worked on to commit the children to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> was apparently the British agreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">If you remember history, the British did permit children to be taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and my sister was one of those who was permitted to go because she was not yet 18; she was 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">So we parted company. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Of course, | didn't realize that we parted company for such a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">As far as | was concerned, | was going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and then | was going to take a walk through <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> one of these days, you know, when things straighten out. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And | came back and | couldn't wait for Lolak to come from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> either because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> wasn't waiting for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And | remember that -- | do remember how this was organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">The Americans took us to a special <span class="NPIP">place</span> , it must have been some kind of a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that was turned into some <span class="BUILDING">dormitories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="672">We had to report a good week before the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> left from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">They took us, we spent there a couple of days. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">After that, they put us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> took us -- when | say "us," I'm talking about -- | think | have pictures from those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">They took us by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , all of those people who were going to take that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="676">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> we were again put up in some kind of a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> or something for about a day or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Then we were put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">These <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> were -- | think that what they did for us, they transported us the way they were transporting soldiers back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , because that was the only way. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">This was only '46, and we were put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was Marine -- the first one, | think was Marine Perch and | came on Marine Fletcher, or the other way around. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">These were the two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> that were going back and forth bringing some of the first refugees to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And we were on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> for 14 days, 14 miserable days because | was very seasick, and then we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And Henry came on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> with me, had nothing to do with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">He, too, wanted to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> even though he was in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And he was able to get to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> without the help of anybody through what was called the corporate affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">What happened is that the Joint was trying to bring some refugees to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and since they were trying to fill the quota, they knew that the quota isn't going to be filled, we'll be lost and not everybody had sponsors. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">So what the Joint was doing, they were getting out corporate affidavits. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">What it means apparently that companies, some companies got together and they sponsored. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So Henry was not sponsored by a family member, but he was sponsored by Joint. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And he came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and we were -- since he was a friend of mine, we kept together on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And we did not, as | said, this was not at that point, there was nothing between us yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">But | think it did bring us together, and then in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in the beginning when we were here. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Totally two lost souls. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Not knowing any English. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">You know, just feeling very lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">| didn't get the best reception in my family, although, again, in retrospect probably there were many things | didn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">But...
QUESTION:  Tell me about coming -- you arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Tell me about, do you remember, Bella, was that an important moment?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">ANSWER:  Well, | remember -- | do remember something. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">| remember the day when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> came to the -- when it came close to the port of New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">| remember standing on the -- by that time | was feeling better. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">| think the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> must have gotten calmer, and | was already not -- because | was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">| was a mess. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">| couldn't eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">| remember a difficult <span class="DLF">passage</span> , but the last couple days things were easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And | remember looking at the lights of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">You have to understand we came <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was dark, it was devastated. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">There was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Suddenly | thought | am coming to an absolute paradise. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And | also remember because | must have seen from a distance the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="712"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Cars</span> going, they looked like little match boxes because it was far away, but so many of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And | remember we were so overwhelmed, it was a beautiful and scary sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">It was absolutely beautiful, | do remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I'll never forget that first impression of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And then it was Friday | remember when we arrived, so my four uncles were waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Some, probably other members of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Mostly also a little curiosity, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">But it looked like, you know, we were the first or the second group to arrive from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , so there was a little bit of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And | do remember saying good-bye to Henry. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">| don't -- | suppose Henry was taken by the Hias, because he didn't have anybody to, you know, nobody was waiting for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">But my uncle arranged with his son, who he was married. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">| think he had, his wife was pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">It was a young couple, so they took me to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">They were very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Somehow he thought that because I'm coming from Europe that I'm very religious, so they took me. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">But they felt that I'm observant, so they took me for Shabbat to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And | have to say that my cousin's wife was -- my cousin and his wife were very nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Particularly she, Miriam, | didn't have much language with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">She didn't speak Polish; she didn't speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">| don't speak Yiddish, | could understand some. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">So were probably communicating. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">She was speaking in Yiddish, | was answering her in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And | spent that Saturday, that Shabbat, with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And then on Sunday, | don't remember what | did on Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">She may have gone with me shopping or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">| probably called Henry in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hias</span> , although | don't remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And | do remember that on Monday, | was taken by my cousin who worked in my uncle's <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="739">My uncle owned a <span class="BUILDING">jewelry factory</span> -- not a <span class="BUILDING">jewelry factory</span> , it was making bracelets for watches. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">The name of the firm was Jacobi & Bender. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">It was a very, very big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">My uncle, as | told you, was a very wealthy man. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">He employed a couple of hundred people, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">So anyway, | was brought into his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and | had a problem with my uncle anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">When | first saw him, | don't remember that impression when | first saw when | got off that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="746">| think | was probably overwhelmed, but when | walked into his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> | went into a state of shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">He looked like my father, it was my father's brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">My father had five brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">He looked most like my uncle -- | mean, this uncle looked most like my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And here was this man who was this big, rich uncle who | didn't have any language with. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">| couldn't talk to him, my benefactor, if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">He brought me to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and he looks like my father but it's not my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">So | think it had an effect on me, it was hard really. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">He -- | don't remember exactly what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Things were going on probably, but he sent me with a cousin of his who was a refugee from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="756">He had brought -- we had some family in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> apparently, and my uncle did bring -- you Know, he was a good man, but he was insensitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And | don't think he meant -- he meant to be a good person to me, but he just didn't do the right thing, perhaps not knowing how to do the right thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">But, as | said, he brought his family from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , some of his cousins, you know, before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And one of them, her name was Dora, had already was working already in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">She was working in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and she spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">So | had a common language with her, and he sent her with me shopping. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Because | didn't have clothing, | had -- | really didn't look very presentable. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">So she went with me to the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , | remember, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And he probably gave her a carte blanche or whatever and she bought me clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">But she was afraid of him, too, | suppose, so she was very careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And | can understand, so she bought me three pairs of panties and two bras. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">In other words, she was very -- she wanted to make sure that | had enough for a beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And after that, that evening, my other uncle -- | had, as | told you, four uncles. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">My other uncle who was his -- who was Uncle Max's, the rich uncle's -- he was the one who was contracted. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">He was the one who was taking care of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">He was a very religious Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">He was the one whose son's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> | went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">So it was that uncle who lived at that point in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">He had lost his family in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but he had two sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Not <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , during the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but he had two sons that he managed to bring to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">So lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> , that religious uncle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">QUESTION:  What was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">ANSWER:  His name was Uncle Favish (ph), and Uncle Favish was a very religious, ultra- Orthodox Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And he rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for me in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> somewhere not far from where he was with some person. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And | think he was stingy, and perhaps he didn't want to exploit his brother again. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">But he was not -- again, there are all kinds of members in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">He rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for me for $35, and he paid this woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Her name was Mrs. Fox, he gave her $15 and said to her -- maybe he gave her $20. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">But | remember that | had -- no, | think he gave her $15. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And he said that when | come, I'll pay the rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">In other words, he didn't have brains to pay for one month's rent for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">| don't know where he thought | was going to get the $20 from, but that's what he told her. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So | come into this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , | get this furnished. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And, by the way, it was very difficult to get <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">So, you know, the fact that he found me a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was a nice thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">| move into this -- | get into this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , this is Monday evening, and I'm supposed to come to work Tuesday morning to my uncle's <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="792">So | come in, and Mrs. Fox takes me -- the first thing she does for me is she takes me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> to show me how to flush a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And | started to cry, because | knew how to flush a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="794">| didn't come from -- when | started to cry and | said to her, she spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And | said to her, "Why are you showing me how to" -- She said to me that when she came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , she didn't know how to flush a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="796">So | said, "Well, you Know" -- she came from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> somewhere or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">| said, "Well, you know, there may have been places in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where they didn't have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> in your time, and maybe even in my time. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">But, you know, also didn't stand still in these 30, 40 years that you've been here." </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And | -- we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and we even had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and it flushed water. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">But anyway, so that was my beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">She also didn't let me use the Frigidaire, because that was not in the agreement, which meant that | had to eat out. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">So | had a rough beginning, if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">You know, if you can understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Funny thing is it wasn't, I'm sure, it wasn't meant that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">| had -- | started working, and I, you know, | got my first check and | made my arrangements. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">| had my rough couple of months in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Actually, | have to say that my wealthy uncle took me to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> finally. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">On July 4th, the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> closed for one week. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And he had told me before that he is going to take me to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for a week so | can meet his wife and his daughter and spend a week in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on <span class="REGION">Long Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="810">He lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lawrence</span> , <span class="REGION">Long Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="811">So | went with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="812">QUESTION:  You hadn't been to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> before that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="813">ANSWER:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">This was the first time | was invited to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to spend a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And | went to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Oh, | want to tell you something else that happened to me which very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">| was very upset in the beginning because | couldn't manage my money. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Later on, when | could admit to Henry that my family was not treating me the best way, Henry would -- he managed much better having come to strangers. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">But sometimes this works out. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">So anyway, but at one point when | was sitting and eating my lunch, and my lunch consisted for the first couple of weeks until | could get myself -- because | was making $18 a week after taxes. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And | had to pay $35 for rent and the first $20, | had, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">So | was having trouble managing, and | ate my main dinner in the automat. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">But for lunch, | couldn't afford to go out, and | couldn't keep anything in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="824">So | bought a loaf of bread in wax paper, and | would take two pieces of bread and | would wrap it in the wax paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And when people sat down to have lunch at work, | would take my two pieces and | would eat my two pieces of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And | was feeling sorry for myself, to be very honest. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">| wrote to my girlfriend, Esther, that | wished that | were back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szczecin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="828">So one day, Dora came over, and | was sitting and | was probably feeling sorry for myself so | looked say. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">Or maybe | was crying, and she said, " 2" "Why are you crying?" </span><span class="sentence" id="830">So | couldn't take it anymore, so | opened the two pieces of bread to show her that I'm eating -- you know, after all | went through, I'm also telling you that in 1946, | wasn't quite 20, so | wasn't that grown up. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">So | was feeling sorry for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">| think that if | had been more adult, | would have managed my uncle better, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">You know, | could, but | didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">So | opened those two pieces of bread, and | said, " " "That's why I'm crying." </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And so she got very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">You know, | was telling her that | was eating two pieces of dry bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">You know, this is my lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">So she got a hold of me and dragged to my uncle's <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And then she started to talking -- | didn't know what the hell she was saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And he looked at her, looked at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And he pulled out $50 from his pocket, and he told her to tell me that -- oh, the first thing she said to him, because | had asked her, that they are not paying me enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">That if they paid me a little more, she would -- you know, | could manage. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">So he said, and | understood that, because my English was- | was beginning to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">This is what they pay here, meaning -- now, maybe this was policy that he wasn't telling anybody what to pay me. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">| was working in the wrapping department, and that was what they were paying. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">By the way, | was working on accord, this was piecework. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And eventually, | was able to make more money because | quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">But at that point, | was still having trouble, so he gave me the $50. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">So he said to her, but he can give me $50. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">And he said to me to her, through her that if | need more money, | should come him. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Now, you see, this is where he was not sensitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">| never went back to him for another $50 or for another $10. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">What he should have done -- see, when he died in 1966, | came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in '46. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">So that's 20 years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">When he died, he left me $20,000 in his will. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">| mean, | was not the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">He left for all the survivors, for all the children who survived, because | and my sister and then later on he found a couple of nephews. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">There were a couple of people who survived from my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">All of those, there were about eight of us -- all of us were given some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">You know, he left them in the will. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">He was a very wealthy man, but, you know, this not even a Jewish -- Jews usually leave their <span class="REGION">estates</span> to their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">But he did have in his will, he left for all of the children who survived, for all those, some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And he left me -- now, if he had given me in 1946 $1,000 and send me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to teach me how to type. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">| did go to, of course, evening classes, and | started to learn English, and | was reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">So, you know, but if he had given me a kind of a help in the beginning, it would have been worth more than the $20,000 in 1966. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">It was nice to get the $20,000, and he was working and earning good money. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">And it was -- | think it was -- | want to tell you something nice about his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">His wife, when my uncle took me to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lawrence</span> , <span class="REGION">Long Island</span> , | took my little valise with my belongings and my aunt waited for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">She may have met me before, she may have come to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">But | didn't -- | was never in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="871">| had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and they welcomed me very nicely, and she came in and she asked did | need anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And | said, "No," and she wanted to see what | have. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">She looked through my clothing, and she said, "Tomorrow we're going to go shopping." </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And she did not take me to Klines on 14th Street or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">She took me the same <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> where she shopped; she was a lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">She shopped in <span class="BUILDING">Saks Fifth Avenue</span> or wherever. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">She took me those <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , and she bought me some very beautiful things. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">She bought me shoes that | wore for years, and clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">That | remember, she was, you know -- so that was my beginning in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in that sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="880">QUESTION:  Did you start to socialize and have friends and meet other people fairly quickly, or did it take a while? </span><span class="sentence" id="881">You knew Henry, and did you keep in touch with him and -- how did you sort of...
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="882">QUESTION:  ... get beyond just working in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="883">ANSWER:  Mostly it was | stayed -- in the beginning, | didn't make friends, although | am a sociable person. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">But mostly | saw Henry. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Henry and | started getting closer, and we became a kind of a twosome. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">| don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Henry's very good friend survived the war and came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="888">He worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , but he would come for weekends. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">So often the three of us would go to the <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="890">We would go to <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="891">| remember Henry took me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radio City</span> the first time, dropped me off there. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">It was a beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="893">| worked, | started to -- | found out that my sister was turned back. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">They attached an illegal transport to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">legal transports</span> , and my sister was sent back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="895">When | came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , my sister was supposed to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="896">It turned out that she was back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> because they had turned back the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> because, you know, the Haganah was -- well, they needed to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">They were attaching some illegals to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">legal transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And so, but then about a half a year later my sister ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And | remember | started sending her packages because things were rough in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="900">Did | make friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="901">Yeah, | think what happened is that | started to make friends with people who survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="902">The same probably -- as a matter of fact, the first years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , most of my friends, and, in fact, many of them | just met somebody who reminded me -- | found them work. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">Many of them ended up working in my uncle's <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , because they came in and they needed work. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">So | would, you know, ask whether there is a need for somebody, and they would come to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">So | became friendly with one girl whom | brought in and we sat across from each other and we spent time talking while we were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And she was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> survivor, she was already married. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Some other friends came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">In the beginning, I'm just trying to remember, Henry and | did not get married till 1949. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And | lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> and Henry lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , and that was a little difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">So | finally moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="911">| didn't like the lady | lived with, so it was not a pleasant situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">It was not bad, but | didn't -- so | moved into a much nicer <span class="NPIP">place</span> , where the lady permitted me to use the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="913">| could make myself a cup of coffee, a cup of tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And eventually, | moved in where Henry stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">Henry found a wonderful family, American Jews who came in, their daughter got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">They had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="917">| understand Mr. and Mrs. Rhinehart (ph) was wonderful to Henry. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">They took him in like a son. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And then when Henry and | got kind of engaged and when we were going to get married, | moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And after we were married, we stayed with the Rhineharts for several years, and then we managed to get an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="921">So we moved into this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and at that point, as | said, | was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And Henry, he had started going to <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn College</span> in '48 just before we were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">And he was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , he was riding a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> every day, so that he could save some money on transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">But these were good years, and, as | said, he was probably older than many of the students at that point, except for some soldiers who had come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">You know, they were veterans, Gls who were going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="926">So | think Henry befriended a few -- | think Henry may have had two friends who were American. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">It started because they studying together, but my friends at that point, most of them were people who survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="928">| think it was probably still very important to be -- we spoke Polish with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">That was not so good for my English, although, as | said, | did become friendly with some people at work. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">The first person who really befriended me, interestingly enough, was an Irish lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">She was much older than I, her name was Sarah. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">| don't remember her- who said that | reminded her of her when she came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="933">| was freckled, | probably could have passed for Irish at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">| had kind of reddish hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And she remembered herself, more or less that way, so she was very friendly to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And then there were a couple of Italian girls, | do remember as a result of becoming friendly with Toni and Annette -- that was their name, because we had lunch together. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">That | would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and show off my English to Henry, and Henry was much more meticulous about his -- about everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">He was much more of a perfectionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">| was picking things up, and | would say -- this was even before we were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And | would say to him that | am going to -- maybe we should go and see a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And Henry didn't understand why | wanted to see a picture, because that was picture, a movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">Or if | wanted to make myself a sandwich. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">But | was picking up the English that was spoken in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> by some of these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="944">QUESTION:  Some of the people then that you were mixing with were, a lot of them also immigrants, sound like. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">This Irish woman...
ANSWER:  This Irish woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="946">QUESTION: ... and some Italian girls.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="947">ANSWER:  The Italian girls were born in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="948">QUESTION:  Oh, they were born here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="949">ANSWER:  But they were Italians, and they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And if you've ever been around there, | don't Know how it is now, let me tell you they do sound a little different, | suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">Then after we were married -- but, as | said, these were just acquaintances. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Most, | agree with you that most of my friends in the beginning, it was language, common experiences I'm sure had a lot to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">All of my friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> before | came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> were survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">It isn't just that they were Polish, they were survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">We may have met some people here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">| remember we met a very lovely German lady who was much older than we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">She befriended us, and took our horror, | remember later. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">She was a -- she had come to American shortly before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">| remember that she had a son in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Long Island</span> who was a physician, and | don't remember where | got -- we got terribly upset when she told us that she couldn't have us meet -- she wanted us to meet her son, but she couldn't have him invite us to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , because when he came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , he had converted, and he didn't want to admit that he was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And so he didn't want -- she didn't -- now, she didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">She remained Jewish, but it was -- and | remember to me this was so upsetting. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">On one hand, | understood why, because | was contemplating doing something like this shortly after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">| was thinking of going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and | was thinking that if | go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> I'm not going to admit that I'm Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Or | was thinking | would go somewhere, because why go through that again? </span><span class="sentence" id="965">But! </span><span class="sentence" id="966">couldn't do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="967">QUESTION:  Go through what again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="968">ANSWER:  Go through what | went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">It never left me, the possibility that someplace somebody -- | want to tell you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">Whenever something happens in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , | get into a Holocaust mode. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">The best <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me to be when something is going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> is actually <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , because there | see that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> isn't sinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">But when I'm away, | always think that if something happens in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , | always think that it's another Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="973">QUESTION:  And when there's a bombing or something . . .</span></p>

QUESTION:  What is the word you're using?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1002">ANSWER:  Dean (ph) Torah means dean, a misjudgment; Torah, based on the Torah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">It's a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> based on the Torah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">In old times when two Jews had a -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , for instance, when Jews had some of their autonomy, if you will, then often when there was a problem between two people, some kind of a -- they would rather than go to the <span class="BUILDING">civil court</span> , they would go to a rabbi and have what you call a dean (ph) Torah in front of the rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">It's basically a court case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">Well, | had that kind of a dean (ph), Torah with God, but to deny my Jewishness, you see, was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">That | couldn't- | couldn't do that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1011">ANSWER:  Okay. '</span><span class="sentence" id="1012">52, Henry got a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">He got out of <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn College</span> with a- he graduated, and he had a bachelor's degree in chemistry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">And he had a very interesting experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">He applied -- actually, three experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">First of all, he was -- it was suggested to him that he go on to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">He graduated magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa, but we couldn't afford it at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">And he just wanted to go work, so he applied to DuPont; they didn't respond. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">Then he applied to <span class="BUILDING">Kaiser Pharmaceutical Company</span> , and he got an interview, and to all purposes, go the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">And then just as courtesy, he was taken into the <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> of the Vice President. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And the Vice President -- this was 1952 -- the Vice President said something to him in German and Henry answered him in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">And he said to him, "So you're not an American, where were you during the war?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">And Henry said, "| was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">And "Where were you in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And Henry said, "Courtesy of Hitler, in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">And that was the end of his job, he didn't get the job at Kaiser. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">That was '52, chemical companies did not employ Jews very readily. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">But he did get a job a month later with Berikson (ph) Research Laboratory, and he was sent by Berikson, who was a Swede educated in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">And he employed Henry and gave him a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , and Henry opened an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> for him where he was going to do some research and literature search. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">And that's how we -- Henry came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , and | was very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">| didn't want to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , | really didn't want to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">| had made my friends, it was my <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">It was very hard for me to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">And, as a matter of fact, Henry was commuting between January and May. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">He would come here every week and come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for weekends, come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">And the commute was difficult because we didn't have the <span class="DLF">turnpike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">It was a real trip, but he did and he finally -- but, you Know, we had to make a decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">He wasn't going to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , he had a job and a job that was a good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">| remember when Henry came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and told me that he's going to be making $75 a week, and | said to Henry in all earnest, seriously, | said, "Henry, what are we going to do with all this money?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">Because it was a lot of money for us, it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">So! </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">came here in April, and the cherry blossoms were out and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was beautiful, | remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">And Henry's boss, Berikson, was here, and he literally wined and dined me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">And then so | agreed that | had to move, so we moved and | was miserable in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">First of all, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> in 1952 was a very provincial town, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> was really an exciting <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">And | didn't have any friends, and | was very lonely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">| was really lonely, it was really difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">So what we would do often is spend a week here and go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> for weekends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">So we were going back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">But then | met some friends, | made my first American friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">| met two neighbors, they were both my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">Their husbands were Henry's age, so we were kind of the three couples, the six of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">The funny thing is that they were all from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ; they were not Washingtonians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">One, Shirley, was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Allentown</span> , <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> and the other was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">So that made it that was our kind of bond, and we became very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">And we stayed friends till this day, as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">These were my first friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , and in 1954, | think, | had my daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">| became, you know, | gave birth to my daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">That was five years after we were married, and then about a year and a half later, | had Craig, we had Craig. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">And we had the <span class="BUILDING">townhouse</span> , a little <span class="BUILDING">townhouse</span> , a semi-detached <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Silver Spring</span> not far from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">And | was doing absolutely one thing, | was saving money to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">By that time, of course, my sister was already married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">She had two children, her husband had already been in the War of Independence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And we were in contact all the time, | was forever sending packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">Times were rough in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">| mean in comparison, | was rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">But | was saving money to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and in 1959 | took my five-year-old daughter and three-and-a-half-year-old son; in March of '59, we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">| took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , | had to because | was taking an awful lot of stuff with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">As | said, things were rough in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">And | went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and | spent -- | left my poor husband for all this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">He came for a month, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">I'm sorry, he was gone a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">He had, at that point, he had started working and had left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berikson</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">He was working for the National Cotton Council, and it was a very good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">And he had some trips that he needed to take to Europe, so he came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">But | was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> from March to September 19- -- | was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for a half a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">| saw my girlfriend, Esther, of course, who was by that time married and had a little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">And | was with my sister, she had three children at that point and | fell in love with <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">At that point, | think that's when | started making peace with God a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">| walked the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of Es Salt and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">| walked into the first <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , and my sister who was not religious would light Shabbat candles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">She wouldn't say a prayer, she would say, "Shabbat, Shalom." </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And | thought this was a very nice custom for a beginning for me, and | started -- | became very interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">| always loved history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">I's funny, you said you liked it because | always like history, always loved archeology. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">If my life had normally, when | was child | used to tell my father that I'm going to be an archeologist, | didn't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">But when | came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , | had already been enrolled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">| was going to <span class="BUILDING">night school</span> in <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> , and | seriously thought of becoming an accountant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">| thought it would be a good thing to do, | wouldn't have to work maybe full-time, you know, raising kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">But | switched, | decided to study Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">And | started to really, | started studying Torah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">| enrolled at <span class="BUILDING">Baltimore Hebrew College</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">| took all my courses there in Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">| got my degree in Hebrew letters, and | became a licensed Hebrew teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">And while | was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , | started teaching Hebrew in different <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">For a while | taught at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Northwood</span> when they had Hebrew as a language. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And then the last 10 years before | retired, | was supervising the Hebrew Department at <span class="BUILDING">Washington Hebrew Congregation</span> , so that was my last -- but studying Hebrew, studying Torah, studying the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , | did it a lot of reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">And | also for the first time, | did not before, | didn't talk much about the Holocaust and | didn't read much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">| started reading a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1100">QUESTION:  When?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1101">ANSWER:  | started -- well, it kind of came together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">| needed to understand, | needed to understand a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">| couldn't make peace with the Holocaust emotionally myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">| don't think anyone -- occasionally, sometimes, you know, if they tell you, you know, that a therapist or a psychologist or a psychiatrist can help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">These are not problems that a psychiatrist can -- | mean there was nothing that | could work out with a psychiatrist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">It isn't that | needed to understand why my mother didn't treat me right or | didn't -- there wasn't anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">To understand the Holocaust, you can't understand the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">In other words, | can't imagine that anybody can be helped by a psychiatrist in terms of the experiences of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">Perhaps some people, if they have some guilt relate it to the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">I'll be very honest with you, | never felt guilty that | survived and some didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">Because | didn't survive, | didn't do anything to anybody to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">| survived by sheer luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">Some Holocaust survivors have this guilt, even if they survived the same way as | did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">| don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">Maybe that kind of a thing can be cleared up or helped through some therapy, just to understand that there's no guilt in having survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">On the contrary, if anything, perhaps a little triumph that Hitler didn't accomplish everything, that somehow we're here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">And, you know, | married and | have a son and a daughter, so, you know, why should | feel guilty about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">But to go somewhere and try to understand and to make peace with the Holocaust on an emotional level, | don't try and | can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">When | get a bad dream, when | have a nightmare, | either take a pill or | get up and read a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">Henry does it all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">When he sees his father's face -- he doesn't tell me much, but | Know that he was -- the last person, he was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with his father, and he can't get rid of that face. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">He sees his father with that -- once in a while, he tells me that he sees his father because they were on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> together, and he had this three, four-day, you know, gray growth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">And his father gave him something that he had, they came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">That was a horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> to begin with, and so he didn't have much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">Maybe he had some cigars and maybe he had some -- maybe he a silver dollar or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And he gave it to Henry and he said, "Take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">| don't need it anymore." </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">Or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">And | know when Henry has that dream or when he sees this, he just gets out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">| don't ask him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">Goes down to the <span class="BUILDING">den</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">Take a crime story and he reads. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">You can't solve anything about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">But | needed to solve for myself, | don't mean solve. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">| needed to understand how God could permit that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">Now, Henry doesn't have this problem because | think he's an atheist or he’ an agnostic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">So he's not asking God how God could allow it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">Insofar as he's concerned, he has an expression, he says, "Shit falls." </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">Look what's going on all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">There are people killing people in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">So maybe in that sense he doesn't have, but | have -- I'm not an agnostic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">| have some kind of a belief, | don't necessarily believe in a Jewish God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">| believe in a Supreme -- | believe in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">So | have to figure out for myself, | had to, how this could happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">And they way | have solved it, and | think I've said that perhaps in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , when | read a book by Dr. Fakenheim (ph), Professor Fakenheim, | think he was a professor at the University of -- Canadian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">There's a <span class="BUILDING">University</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , I'm trying to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">| don't remember the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">Anyway, he was a professor of history in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">He now | think is a professor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moretus</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">And he wrote a book, "God's Place in History." </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">| don't remember exactly, you may not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And he said something in the book, and it's absolutely true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">He said that God was not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , that God gave us -- when you speak to the Jews, he gave us the Torah, but that's not important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">He gave, he taught people what is right and what is wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">And if we choose to do the wrong thing, then we do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And God didn't create <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , the Germans did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">And what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was between the Germans and their victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And now, perhaps in the earlier history, according to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fakenheim</span> , did interfere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">He took us out of <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , but that was a god of a different time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">In our time, God does not interfere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">So | have that kind of a peace with myself that | don't blame God for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ; | blame the Germans for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">Just as | blame, just as | will put the blame of the people who kill each other in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Burundi</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1168">ANSWER:  Oh, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">Well, you know, it would be nice if my daughter could -- because | sometimes talk to her about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">| did talk to my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">| think at different times, and it depended -- when the reason came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">| didn't live it all the time with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">Actually, when the kids were little, when they were growing up in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , these were really happy times for us in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">But | talked to them because when they were little, and they wanted to know, for instance, why Lisa Zidner has a grandmother who's coming to visit and Janie has a grandpa and grandma coming, and where are my parents and where are Henry's parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">So | told them that both my parents and Daddy's parents are not alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">Why aren't they alive? </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">| said, "Well, they died in the war."

"</span><span class="sentence" id="1179">Well, they didn't die -- they died because of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">And when you will be bigger, | will explain it.". </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">And | did, and, of course, in 1959 they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> with me, and we talked a little bit more about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">The children were still little. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">When they got bigger -- and | did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">For instance, on Tu B'Shevat, | always lit candles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">That | did even though | didn't go to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> because this was the anniversary of the destruction of my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">So | lit candles, and when the kids were big enough and they would ask me why I'm doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">And | told them I'm lighting the candles to remember my mom and my father and my sister and my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">And as they were getting bigger, | would tell them about some of the things that happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">Depending on their age when they got big enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">Henry did much less of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">He had a lot of trouble talking about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">On the other hand, and | did discuss this with my daughter, | asked her whether she feels - because | wanted to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">That was some many years later, whether she was -- when | read the book my Helen Epstein, did you read it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">Helen Epstein wrote a book called, "The Children of the Holocaust." </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">| think she wrote about that second generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">And | was very upset when | read the book, because apparently she wrote the book, she based it upon a study that was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">Or maybe she did the study, discussing it with a psychiatrist or some psychiatrist in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , whose children -- whose patients were children of Holocaust survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">And she paints a picture of real neurotic, disturbed children, and | was upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">First of all, the first thing | did at that point, | wanted to know from my daughter and from my son whether something like this -- after all, no matter how objective you think you are, you're not objective, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">Did I? </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">Did | fill them with these kind of -- some of the stories that she writes about, you know, these children really grew up in very dysfunctional, difficult <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">So | talked to my kids, and both my children told me, and this was not right away, but through the years; this is the picture | got from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">That theirs was a happy childhood, that they had a good <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">That they were aware of a lot of things and they were not totally not affected. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">In other words, okay, in other words, what they -- then, as a matter of fact, let me tell you how they saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">That they were not to be compared with the children that Helen Epstein is talking about fully. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">And, in fact, it was Robbi (ph) who came out, my daughter, with the idea that perhaps we were lucky, Henry and |. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">We had survived the Holocaust and we were young. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">| had lost my parents, lost my sister and my brother, but | didn't lose a husband and | didn't lose children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">Many of the children described in Helen's books were raised as second children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">They were raised by people who had lost not just their past, but their future. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">Some of these people lost their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">Later | met some -- | know some people were -- sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Robbi had a friend who told her -- he was a Survivor's son -- that he didn't know that he had a sister until his father was on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">death bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">When his father was dying, he told him that before the war, he was married and he had a daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">Why these people could not deal with it, | don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">| belonged to the generation, and there were many like me, who survived the war and did not lose husbands and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">| was too young for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">That may have made a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">| think that for anybody who studies the Holocaust survivors, | think they should draw that <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">That was more difficult for people who had that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">So in that sense, I'm not taking any credit, it may have been easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">Did my children -- were my children affected by some of it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">Definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">In what way? </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">Well, first of all, the fact that Henry did not talk was not very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">It would have helped if he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">On the other hand, | can't say that he never talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">He talked about before the war how things were at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">He just didn't talk about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , he couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">And that was probably -- but | did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And | think that was -- Robbi always felt that that was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">That | had, that they didn't have to imagine things being worse than they were, so that was helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">On the other hand, Robbi said that | was neurotic about certain things, and, for instance, | was probably overprotective. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">| tried not to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">Up here, | tried not to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">| sent my son and my daughter -- my daughter was 10 years old when she went for four weeks to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and my son was nine and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">In other words, | sent them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">| gave them a lot of freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">| did not -- but that was up here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">Emotionally, | suppose if Robbi was late from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , | may have been a little more upset than | should have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">Fortunately, even though Henry did not -- Henry acted in this sense as good balance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">When I, when we went -- when the kids learned how to swim and we'd be going to a <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> and | would go with the kids, and they learned how to jump from the, what is it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">From the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">diving board</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">And so we made an agreement, so | said to them, "Okay, when I'm not here, you can't jump off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">diving board</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">You can swim." </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">And so the kids said, "Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">Why can't we? </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">We're good swimmers." </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">By the way, I'm not a swimmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">| can float. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">So when we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but | said, "No, | won't allow you when I'm not here." </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">So the kids as usually they would take their case to their father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">So they would say to Henry, "Daddy, Mom won't let us jump off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">diving board</span> when she's not there." </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">So Henry looked at me and he said, "Bella, tell me what is the difference?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">First of all, he thought it was funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">He said, "What could you do for them if you were there watching?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">So that was already -- but anyway, | said, "Well, I'll feel better if I'm there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">I'll holler for help." </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">Well, anyway, this was said to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">Henry said to me, "You can either be there all the time, but you cannot restrict them." </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">So that was settled, and this was how we settled some of theses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">So yeah, | had some, | wouldn't let Craig ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> until Henry said that this is crazy, and then Craig rode the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">But we settled this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1265">QUESTION:  You negotiated together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1266">ANSWER:  Yeah, we did, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">Yeah, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">On the other hand, when Craig went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> , he didn't tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">This is how | found out about the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">He took a course on the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">He has a <span class="BUILDING">library</span> on the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">That's not his <span class="DLF">field</span> , but, you know, this his interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">There's no question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">So were the kids affected? </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">| think so, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">But perhaps not in a totally damaging way, | don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">| hope not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">My daughter had some problems, but | don't think they had anything to do with the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">In fact, she used to say to me that when she had -- she had a chemical disorder. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">She had a premenstrual, what is it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">Premenstrual syndrome, PMS, that led practically to depression until they finally medicated her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">It was just totally uncalled for, because it wasn't recognized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">But she said to me that it got to a point that when she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Princeton</span> and she started having problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">And she would go for help, and she said, "Mom, | got to a point where | wouldn't tell them that I'm a Holocaust survivor's child, because they would get into it, " and she said, "and my problem had nothing to do with the Holocaust."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1285">QUESTION:  So she was aware of...
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">But as | say, she's fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">And she's on medication, but if it hadn't been neglected. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">She had some rough years because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">But it was, she said on the other hand, she probably is a little bit more high-strung than she would have been if she hadn't been raised in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> by a mother who, when the phone ring, | would jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">So...
QUESTION:  And now that your children are adults and out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and it's just you and your husband, does he talk more? </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">Do you talk more to other people about what you went through? </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">Is it even a different phase of your life now in your own thinking about the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1293">ANSWER:  Well, this has been a process. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">As | told you, originally, | did not talk about the Holocaust at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">| started talking about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">That was right awaya...
QUESTION:  We need to switch tapes here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">End of Tape 2. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">Tape 3
QUESTION:  This is Tape 3 of an interview with Bella Tovey on June 6th, 1996 -- June 10th, 1996. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">The question that | started to ask at the end of Tape 2 was, your children have left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> now, and you and your husband are here together, and how is your thinking about the Holocaust today, compared to when you had children at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , or when they were young? </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">Where are you now in your thinking about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1301">ANSWER:  Well, mostly, as | said, | didn't -- we don't, Henry and | -- it's funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">We don't talk about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">| can talk to Henry about it, although | will say this: In 19- -- there are a couple of things that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">First of all, | talk about the Holocaust more mostly because -- and | started originally when | was a Hebrew teacher talking to my class. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">First | talked to my children at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">Then | talked - but mostly that's why | agreed to interviews, | gave my oral history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">When | started reading that people were denying that the Holocaust happened, | think | took, | made a definite decision that | need to make some kind of a contribution if | can, because | realize that there are people who are denying that the Holocaust happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">And particularly | remember reading about a Professor Butz, B-u-t-z, | think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">He was at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Northwestern</span> , and he wrote a book called "The Hoax of the Twentieth Century," denying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">In other words, this is not just, you know, some of these skinheads denying the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">But this is scholarly work being written that the Holocaust never took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">It's that kind of a thing that made me want to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">That, plus the fact that we did take Roberta and Craig to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in 1989, shortly after Henry retired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">We went back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Henry's city</span> , went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">We went to all of these <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mogilev</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">Our son and our daughter wanted, they felt it was an incredible experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">My husband paid for it by becoming -- and he's never been depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">He was depressed for three months after we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">It was a rough trip for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">He did it for his kids, and it was at that time that he talked about his experiences because it was -- | mean we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1322">QUESTION:  To the kids?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1323">ANSWER:  Yeah, to the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">Most of the time Henry and | do not talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">When I'm called up occasionally by the <span class="BUILDING">Children's Museum</span> , | go and talk, because | feel it's important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">| gave a talk at my <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> a couple of years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">Henry actually gave a talk once in his life last year at the Liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">We had a wonderful service dedicated to the liberators last year, and Henry was one of the people who the rabbi -- Henry's very fond of our rabbi, so he twisted his arm, and Henry gave a short talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">That was the only time that Henry talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">| will also say to you, though, that when some of my friends who are survivors -- | don't have too many friends here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">| have one couple, but we have some friends who occasionally come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">When we get together, usually, and this is kind of a joke and a password. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">That one of our friends will say, "Well, we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">Why don't we go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">Why don't we go to sleep?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">In other words, if | can explain what happens, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">| think that when we are together, particularly with people who went through what we did, we find ourselves somehow drifting back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">And usually somebody then will say, "Okay, we're already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">Why don't we call it quits? </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">And why don't we go to sleep?"</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1341">QUESTION:  | don't understand that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1342">ANSWER:  What happens is that we are together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">We can be talking about our kids, we can be talking about politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">Henry and | volunteered this days in the <span class="BUILDING">Whitehouse</span> , and we are very, very pro-Clinton, for instance, so we talk about politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">We can talk about music. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">My husband loves birds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">We can be talking, and then suddenly somebody will say something, remember something that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">And then we'll start talking about -- and one thing leads into the other, he'll mention something, then we start talking about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">And then somebody will usually say, "Well, we are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">Why don't we go to sleep?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">Meaning, that somehow <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> is the, what is it, is the synonymous thing with Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">So we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , why don't we call it quits? </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">Why don't we stop talking?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1354">QUESTION:  Meaning, let's not talk about this anymore?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1355">ANSWER:  Meaning that somehow it's -- no matter what we talk about, when we are together with people who went through what we went through, we somehow end up getting to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">So yeah, can | say that we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">Yeah, we do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">Somehow it didn't leave us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">| remember you have on that big film, the big one in the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , somebody said that she tries not to teach her children to hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">| never taught my kids to hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">And if they want to forgive, my son is flying to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">| hope he has a good trip, and he's so happens that his trip is paid for by his <span class="BUILDING">University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">And the tickets, he's going via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> with Lufthansa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">And from there | think he's taking via -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but he's stopping in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> for a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">| will not go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">My son is going, he isn't going to visit <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but he is going to go through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> and go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">It's okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1368">QUESTION:  Because you still have...
ANSWER:  It's okay for him, and it's fine, but | will not go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">| will not forget and I'm not forgiving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">Not where the Germans are concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">So am | left with something? </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">Yeah, probably.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1375">QUESTION:  Are they old enough to ask questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1376">ANSWER:  Probably, but we haven't gotten to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">His oldest daughter is 10 and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">Two are from <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> ; one is from <span class="COUNTRY">Peru</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">And Kendall is going with Craig to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , so | don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">I'm sure that Craig has talked to her about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1381">QUESTION:  It would be interesting maybe as they get older to see how you think about talking to them.</span></p>
