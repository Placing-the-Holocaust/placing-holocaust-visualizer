<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  Can you describe please a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was very funny looking <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , in respect that there is, as you board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> there 1s only one way of going down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was built sort of like <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicles</span> and in order for you to go into your <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , you had to crawl into it, there was not enough <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> for you even to sit and we all crawled into our <span class="INT_SPACE">spaces</span> and we could not even move in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , we were so close to each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  So there were several layers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Many, many layers. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">The top, I would say about six or seven layers, so that you had to pull yourself in and then underneath same kind, but the only thing you could see that there was steel, up was wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So the lower portion was, you could hit the steel and upper portion, it was wood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  So it was a huge, let's see, a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> made from steel, on which they built a sort of superstructure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  Superstructure, wood superstructure, correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And of course we were too many of us on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  How many?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  Over 700 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So, because we were so many, they told us we cannot go up on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> , all of us, So We were given times when we were, were, about maximum 100 people could be on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> , so we took shifts when we could go on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> were in, very few of them and it was just a terrible conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">From the beginning we saw that it's, it would be worse than a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> because the <span class="DLF">air</span> was difficult even to breathe. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And yes there is one thing I would like to mention, that after we finished with the Romanian customs, then we passed through the people that organized the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Now they restricted us exactly to 10 kilos of baggage. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">One piece, 10 kilos. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Anything over that has to be left behind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  Are you saying that these people who restricted you were not the Romanian Customs, but the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  I don't know whether they were people, but anyway they were part of the organization of the, of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  We had no choice, no time to even to ask who are you. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">They told , You're going to board now, but you have to, you have to leave everything above the 10 kilos." </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And they had, of course, a scale. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">You put your suitcase on a scale. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">My suitcase was, if I remember correctly, something around 15 kilos. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">They said, "You have to unload it." </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So we unloaded several things and then we put back, it was 12 kilos. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Unload it again until it was 10 kilos, then we were allowed to proceed. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So imagine so many people waiting, waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So it took us forever just to embark on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  Why do you think they did this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  I think they were afraid of overweight already. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Already the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was meant for less than half of the people that we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">When actually, in order to obtain more funds, they allowed more people to join, until it became 700, over 760 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  Did you feel in any way that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was unstable, not very stable because of it's load?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  I doubted that we ever made anywhere and everybody, everybody was so flabbergasted, shall we say, that this, that a thing like what they call a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> will manage to take us so far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We doubted that it will ever be able to leave the <span class="DLF">port</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  How big was the crew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  We haven't seen the crew until actually when we're all on board. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We, we were told that the crew, it's a Bulgarian captain and a Bulgarian chief officer and several Bulgarian, the whole crew was a Bulgarian crew, about seven or eight people. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And actually we seldom saw the, the captain altogether, but you see, we were so, so many of us, that we have, we were not manage, we were not managing even to walk around. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">We were glad when we were allowed to go on, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> for a few hours just to breathe a little bit of better air.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  Can you please describe the journey?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  The journey, we left Constanza(ph) at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We were pulled out of the <span class="DLF">port</span> by a tug, a Romanian tug and once they took us out into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , they disconnected and they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Then, we tried to work the engines, we had a very, very hard time to make the engine work. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">It pop up and then stopped again. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Anyway, I think it took us practically all night and the engine still didn't, didn't start. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Then I understand that we had, start sending SOS's because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> was floating into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , but it was not moving anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">The captain send SOS's and eventually, now the, now the next day, the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tug</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tugboat</span> that took us, pulled us out, came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">It came back and we requested that they, if they could repair so that the engine can start. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">They tried and tried but they told us that 1t would cost us money. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So we explained that we are left with no funds at all because the, the Custom took away everything we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So then they requested that we, everybody that has a wedding ring, which were, miraculously we were allowed to keep. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I didn't had one, but in any case, many, many, many people had. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So we collected all the wedding rings from the people and we gave them to the crew of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tugboat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Then they went into the engine and they start playing around with the engine and they said, they, two conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">If we give them enough money, they may be able to pull us all the way into the <span class="REGION">Turkish waters</span> , which would take us about a day or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">But if we don't have enough money, then they said okay, we'll try to repair the engine and if the engine works, we are going to be with you, floating next to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> , into the international water, close to the <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , <span class="REGION">Turkish waters</span> and then we will leave you there. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So finally the engine start working and we start sailing towards <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tugboat</span> was going next to us and then it went away and it took us about three, four days because it was very, very slow, until we reach the so called <span class="DLF">border</span> with the <span class="REGION">Turkish territorial waters</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  Did you know other passengers on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , did you talk to them during the journey?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  Oh yes, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">First I had the girlfriend, my, we were actually engaged and she came with both of her parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">They were, their <span class="NPIP">place</span> was way below, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> 's belly, like. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So and I was completely on different side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">But we managed to see each other from time to time, somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">She was with her two parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And I had also two friends from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that were also on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and several other people that I knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  Did you talk to them during the ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  No, I did not know him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  Did you feel that there was any organized or organization or organized life on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  We, we knew that of course there is a Batar(ph) that organized everything, but we have very little communication with them, so and besides that, as I said, there was no way of moving around, so each one just stayed in it's <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> until we were allowed to go to, on, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> for a, for a, for a short time and then back there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  So basically everything that you knew about the trip, during the trip, was by way of rumors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Exactly, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  So what happened when you got closer to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  When we got closer to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> , the engine stopped working and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was floating, you know, towards the, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">It was right in the other opening of the <span class="DLF">Bosporus(ph) Straights</span> and the rumor was that we were too close to <span class="DLF">mines</span> , because the <span class="REGION">Turkish waters</span> were mined and there were only certain <span class="DLF">passages</span> that they can get through. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So but we had no way of knowing how to get through. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">But suddenly a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Turkish tug</span> appeared, from the Bosporus(ph) and tied us up and pulled us through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Turkish water</span> and took us right into the <span class="DLF">Istanbul harbor</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> we anchored, in the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> , which is quite a, quite a big <span class="REGION">area</span> , between the Asian and the <span class="REGION">European sides</span> , right? </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So you have, the <span class="DLF">port</span> is on the <span class="REGION">Asian side</span> , but as well as on the <span class="REGION">European side</span> , we're right in the middle of that big water, like a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  So you are not close to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  No, we were pretty far away from both shores, but anchored right there in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And of course we had then, Turkish police came on board and they came, they were constantly on board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> and we stayed there for about two months. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">From what we understand, that the Turks will not allow us to go into the <span class="REGION">Mediterranean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">We couldn't go forward, we couldn't go backwards and the engines were irreparable on board <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So finally I understand, we got permission for mechanics to come on board, remove the engine, take it ashore and try to repair it ashore. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So they removed the engine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  So, if my understanding 1s correct, one of the problems was that you, you, the passengers didn't have an immigration visa for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  Right, first we did not have any immigration visa for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , secondly we had no visas for <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , we were not allowed to get out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> and we had to stay aboard until somehow they would manage to repair the engine. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Meanwhile of course there were all kinds of rumors that were going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">First, rumors that maybe there is a chance that they childrens will be allowed to disembark. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And there were quite a lot of children on board. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Then there were rumored that maybe they will allow us, they will make a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> on the Asian side of the <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> and allow us to stay there, until somehow it will be resolved what to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">All these things never materialized, neither the children, neither going on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">board</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">But, what did happen 1s that finally nine people that were on board with expired immigration papers for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , they got permission to be taken out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> and then to be, to proceed to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So the nine people, nine person disembark, were allowed to disembark during those two months that we stay there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  Did you ever see spokesman in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  I saw him, not on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">He picked me up when I was in the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  So later?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  Much later, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  Did you ever see any British representative of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  No, I did not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  So the only contact that you, as passengers, had, was with the Turkish authorities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  Could you be so kind to describe the sanitary conditions on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> during these two months?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  They were terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">First of all, we had not enough food, we were just eating biscuits. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Finally we understood that the Jewish agency in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> got permission to export some food to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> , but it was all dried food and the only thing they allowed water to be, you know, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">water tanks</span> to come and fill up that, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> 's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and the sanitary condition was just, I would say atrocious because we had no opportunity to wash ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">A lot of people start getting fleas, there were a lot of sickness, vomiting and, and people crying and it was quite a, a very difficult position to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  Do you remember a ship committee, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> during this period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  Yes, the Batar(ph) organized some kind of a committee and they tried to keep people from, from getting wild, like trying to get out on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">But actually, people were so, shall we say, flabbergasted by this happening, that it's like they gave up living. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">They, they, as the time was passing, they, we start believing that we never get out of this, because nothing is moving, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">On top of it, we don't even have an engine, never mind going someplace.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">QUESTION:  So the engine was gone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">ANSWER:  Gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  It was ashore, in order to be repaired?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And the engine was never returned to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">QUESTION:  Never returned?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  Never returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">QUESTION:  How do you know this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">ANSWER:  Because we were very surprised on the twenty-third of February, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tug</span> , coming and start pulling us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">First of all, we see a, quite a huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tugboat</span> coming and trying to tie us up to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tug</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Then we have, we see people coming and they did not pull the anchor, they cut the anchor. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Now, the anchor is made out of steel, so they came and physically cut the anchor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  Did you, did you witness this, or?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  I saw it myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">QUESTION:  You saw it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  First of all you hear it, you know, when they try to cut off the anchor and, and secondly, you could see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , trying to, when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tugboat</span> tried, the people from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> tried to attach the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> , quite a number of people tried to prevent them from doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Obviously we had some suspicion about that, so we, we prevented them to come to attach it, so that the police start pushing us back. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So quite a commotion for quite a while until the police manage to push us back into our, below the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  Did you see the Turkish police on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">All the time and of course when this happened, we had quite a, quite an army of police to subdue us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  So you were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> when they pushed you back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  Yes, I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I remember that they start pushing us back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">QUESTION:  What happened next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">ANSWER:  Well the next they managed to attach the, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tug</span> , managed to attach the rope to the front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and they start pulling us, that was already nighttime. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">They start pulling us back into the <span class="REGION">Black Sea</span> , back to the Bosporus(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Took several hours, they pull us out, out in the, back into the <span class="REGION">Black Sea</span> , then they cut off, they cut off the rope and they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Of course, we shouted, what are we supposed to do now? </span><span class="sentence" id="219">They start yelling, "Go back to Borgaz(ph)." </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Why Borgaz(ph), I don't know, this is one small <span class="DLF">port</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">We did not understand at all, but they left and we were now floating fairly close to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shores</span> , because we could hear noises from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">At night of course, you could not see the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> , just noises and we were just floating, no engine. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Of course we were worried about <span class="DLF">mines</span> , we were worried about everything and where do we go without engine? </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Until morning time, morning came and then of course you have a big bang and the whole thing blows up. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And I was projected way up in the <span class="DLF">air</span> , suddenly. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Now, I was exactly, my <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> was right under the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> , so the whole thing blew up and I was in the <span class="DLF">air</span> and then I was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And as I was 1n the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , naturally, were quite a lot of people in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  How many?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">ANSWER:  Hundreds.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">QUESTION:  Alive or dead?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="232">QUESTION:  All alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  Or at least they were swimming, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">People here, there, quite a number of people were swimming all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , including myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And then yelling and yelling, help, help . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Women, women and men, no I haven't seen any children in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And we were floating, it was pretty cold, but luckily the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> was not, was quite calm, just very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And slowly, slowly, I was seeing less people and less people and less people floating. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">At that time, I saw a piece of <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> that had bars and it was quite, you couldn't see the, what was there, but people were holding on these bars and as people left, died or frozen, this piece of deck was getting up and up and eventually you could see that there was a piece of, oh, I would say about, let's see, five meters by six meters, something of this sort.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  Of wood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">ANSWER:  Of wood, the piece of, so the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> was quite thick and so I was also holding on one of these bars.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">QUESTION:  You were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">ANSWER:  In the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , so by just flipping over, I was now on top of the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> and as people were drowning, naturally the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> was getting lighter and going towards the surface, so eventually I was on this <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> , oh with about, let's see, about a foot of water above. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I was still all the time in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , but at least I did not have any more the necessity of swimming.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  Were you dressed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  Yes, completely dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">In actual fact I had a leather jacket, leather kind, it was of course quite heavy because it was full of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">But, in any case, I saw also some kind of piece of, of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> that usually was on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">It was attached with wires on this piece of deck, so by pulling this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> on top of this <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> , now if I sit, when I sit on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> , I was about a few inches above water. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">So now I was above, holding to that piece, above water. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Towards the evening...
QUESTION:  So, so, I'm sorry to interrupt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  That's all right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  You were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , the explosion was sometimes in the morning, after drifting for one night...
ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  On the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , correct? </span><span class="sentence" id="255">You stayed on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> until towards the evening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">At this moment, how many people did you see around you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">ANSWER:  No, I, I saw one, which I, dead, further away from the, from the, from the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> , but it was entangled in wires. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">That was a person there. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I could not reach him because I was myself not very mobile.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">QUESTION:  And that was it, the rest of the people were gone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">ANSWER:  No more people. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">But, towards the evening I see a man, sitting on something which obviously it was a <span class="DLF">door</span> , he was sitting on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and paddling. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So, he came towards me, so I pulled him up and sat him on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And that was the chief officer, a Bulgarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So he, at that time, started talking in Russian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  You knew Russian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  Yes, it's my mother language. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">He told me that he happened to be on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">He was the, he was on duty on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> , when he saw something floating towards the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">It was like, looked like a torpedo anyway, that was coming towards the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> , so he run from the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> towards the <span class="INT_SPACE">captain's cabin</span> and as he was opening the <span class="DLF">door</span> of the <span class="INT_SPACE">captain's cabin</span> , the explosion took him in the <span class="DLF">air</span> and when he landed in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , he landed with that <span class="DLF">door</span> in his hands, with the knob in his hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">QUESTION:  This is the <span class="DLF">door</span> on which he was paddling?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So what he did eventually, he went on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and that, that how he managed to stay in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So when I pulled him, I pulled him off this <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">So, he says that the only way we can survive is really by us shouting all the time, so that we don't fall asleep, because if we fall asleep we will never wake up any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So we were sitting back to back on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> and yelling all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And as the, the night came, as the day came along, we were already exhausted of yelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And then we stopped and, and then I felt that he is not any longer on my back. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I turned around and he, he fell from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> onto the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> and his head was in the water like on his belly. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">In other words, he could not possibly breathe any longer, he was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And, but he was very close to me, but just a corpse.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  So you were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> for?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  About 24 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">QUESTION:  24 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">We are now in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  You could see the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">ANSWER:  All the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Soon as the, day, day, the daylight came, I could see the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> and you could hear the noises of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> , like an engine, pumping engine and things like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  Did you think about trying to reach the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Then I decided, maybe I'll be able to swim to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So I jump into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">What happened is, if you take, from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> and you land into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , you are much lower into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , now the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> was quite far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">So I swim a little bit and I could hardly move, so I turned around and went back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  To the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  To the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">QUESTION:  And to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">ANSWER:  To the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I was only a few yards away and I realized that the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> is much further away than I thought, because of the, on the, when you are on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> , you can see further than when you are 1n the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">QUESTION:  Do you remember anything about what you were thinking during that night?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">ANSWER:  I was, knew that obviously I am going to die from drowning and I, I was not looking forward that kind of death. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">So I was contemplating to cut my veins or something that is a quick death. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So while I was contemplating what I'm going to do next, suddenly I see quite a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> , fairly close, sailing in, in the, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> , in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">So I looked up and I see people on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> that moving pretty fast, like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo</span> , it was like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo vessel</span> , with a few people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And they were pointing towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> , so I yelled at them, but they, they pointing toward the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So I concluded they tell me to swim to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> , which I already tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Anyway, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> goes away and then I see a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> with sailors coming towards me. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">So my conclusion was that that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> , the people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> , the sailors on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> pointed out not to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> , but that somebody's coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Of course they came, they picked me up into the, into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , they pick up the chief officer and the other corpse there, all three of us on, in the, in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and they took us ashore. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">These were sailors from the <span class="BUILDING">lighthouse</span> , which you could see it and they took us into the <span class="BUILDING">lighthouse</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  There were no more bodies on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER:  That's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">They picked up basically myself and two bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Afterwards I don't know what, whether they did pick up or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I talked to them, but you know, it was the language barrier, they speak only Turkish and I didn't have no way of communicating with them at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">But them put me on a, on a, on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , they gave me blankets, cover me with blankets and they gave me some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">They gave me some cheese, bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I remember onions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">QUESTION:  This was in the <span class="BUILDING">lighthouse</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="406">QUESTION:  Can you tell us please, what you felt when you saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">ANSWER:  My first...
QUESTION:  —
ANSWER:  My first reaction was, can I get out of here? </span><span class="sentence" id="408">In other words, to get out of ; going on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , but I soon realized that it was out of the question. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">They, we were locked into this, pushing us <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and there was no way out but to leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">QUESTION:  So you considered going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> before leaving?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">ANSWER:  To get back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> , but that, that thought disappeared very quickly when I realized that the Romanians are not going to allow anybody to leave this condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">QUESTION:  Could you describe to us what type of food you had during the journey to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">ANSWER:  It, each, I think each one of us brought a little bit of something that could keep us until we get so-called normal food. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">So we had a little bit of, a few cans that we were allowed to take and a few biscuits and we were supposed to get, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Again, there were some dry biscuits and basically not much more. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">But they told us, as soon as we reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> we are going to get, the suppliers of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> were going to get us food once we reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  So basically you didn't receive, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , any food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  Hardly any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">There was even no way of getting the food, we were just too many of us into such a small <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">QUESTION:  I'd like to ask you again about the sanitary conditions on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> during the journey to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">ANSWER:  During the journey to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> , first of all we could hardly move, because we were told that, you know, because of so many people, if there are too many of us on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , the, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> can be in danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">So, first of all, they wanted us to move as little as possible and also, once we are on a <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> for a few hours, also to try to keep the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> in balance by not going too much on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So we were directed, some people on the left side, some people on the right <span class="NPIP">side</span> , then go slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">In other words, there was a possibility that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> may get out of balance if we move too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">So the conditions were such that you just stayed in your <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> as much as you can, without, without moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">So there was no way of getting cleaned up or, or even, even, you barely managed to, to drink water, never mind about washing or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And as the time went by, it was getting naturally worse and worse and worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  How about the sanitary conditions in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> during the two months, did they improve or they got worse?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">ANSWER:  They did not improve, but the fact that we were able to go on a <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> , there we were able to get a little bit of water to wash your face, but very, very little of it and there were no facilities that you could use in order to, so you realize that you are going to stay that way until you are going to somehow leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  I would ask, I would like to ask you another question about the moment of the explosion, you, you were thrown into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , dressed, fully dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Did you get injured?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">ANSWER:  No, I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And quite a number of people that were blown, blown into the <span class="DLF">air</span> and landed into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , there was, we did not, I did not see any sign of, of injured people, except that there were just swimming and yelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I didn't see any injured, except that they were just trying to keep afloat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  So let's go back to the moment when you are in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the representative of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish agency</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Did you have your papers with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">ANSWER:  No, I had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Mr. Brod(ph) explained to me that he would, I was taken to his, he was allowed to take me to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because he promised that I'm going, he's going to deliver me the next morning to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> , to the policeman that is waiting for me, to take me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and so he has just that evening time to talk to me and he was, he was talking more than I was, he was a, he tried to explain to me what happened to me after I left the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , that he tried to get to me and they did not allow him to see me, they did not allow him, he weren't to have any kind of contact, written or otherwise, or to talk to me and it, as I said, it were, he told me that it is a total miracle that you, that you survived Shtruma(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I says, "This is a natural thing." </span><span class="sentence" id="440">What, that you survived after Shtruma(ph), this is also quite a miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">So, and he said, "The papers are with the policeman, I'll take it next morning, I have to take you to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and the policeman will go with you all the way to the <span class="DLF">border</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Lebanon</span> and he will release your papers at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">These are paper, it's a [assez passe(ph), with permission to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> as an immigrant. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">This came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , through the, the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> , was given to me, given to the Turkish authorities and the Turkish authorities are going to release it once you leave the <span class="REGION">Turkish territory</span> ."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">QUESTION:  Did the Turkish authorities confiscate your passport, did they keep any papers, or your passport got lost in the...
ANSWER:  No, I, my Romanian passport? </span><span class="sentence" id="445">No, still with me all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">In actual fact, anything that I had on me, they did not touch it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">QUESTION:  They did not touch it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">They didn't touch it, I didn't see any, anything that they went through it, although I was, of course my, my clothing was, in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> I didn't have my clothing with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">But otherwise, everything I had on me, my Shtruma(ph) ticket, my Romanian passport, that's, that's the only thing I had, it was all the time in my jacket.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="454">QUESTION:  You, you didn't see anybody from the <span class="BUILDING">British consulate</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">ANSWER:  I didn't see any, no, I didn't see any British person from any, any authority and in actual fact, even Turkish authority I haven't seen, except when I was interrogated at the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Otherwise, I had, they never give me any explanation why they keep me in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , although I, I try not to antagonize them, but I said that, I did ask them, once they finish with the interrogation, "On what basis do you keep me in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So they said, "Because you are illegal in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , you did not have a visa for <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , so therefore we cannot release you."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">QUESTION:  I understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Because we, before we go further away, I would like to ask you to tell us a few words about the main actors in terms of <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , of this tragedy, how do you feel about <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , how do you feel about <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , how do you feel about Great Britain? </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I would like to know what do you think about the organizers of the trip? </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Basically, how do you see the various responsibilities and <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> or organizations who are responsible for this tragedy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">ANSWER:  Well, let's start with the Romanian authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I understood there is a war and I understand, I understood at that time that <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> was allied to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , consequently they're going to behave about the same way as the Germans are. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Killing of Jews start pretty early in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">At random. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">We had the iron guard, guard . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">That was, behaved the way I understood, just like the Nazi's did in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and to keep away from them, to make sure that they don't get you. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">They can grab you in the <span class="DLF">street</span> or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Of course afterwards, when I had to wear the yellow band with the star of David on it, I realized that they can pick you up, doesn't matter what you do. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">The authorities, the first time that I got in contact with the authorities was of course when I, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Constanza(ph</span> ), I was pretty, they behaved like wild people. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">In the customs, they were putting in their pocket anything that they could get hands on, which at that time I considered to be absolutely barbarian, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Then, the more, then when I went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and then I realized that unless we give them all our wedding rings, they are not going to do anything about it, more than ever that, we are like animals and they behaved like. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Then in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> again, we just saw the Turkish police. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">They were totally unconcerned about human life, or the condition of the human life and the more we were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> , the more we realized that we'll never get out of this because they couldn't care less. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">That we are human being, it doesn't matter, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">It's just that we are an inconvenience to them and they are going to try to correct that inconvenience. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">The fact that we were hope that maybe they'll put us in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , this disappeared very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">The only time that we had a little bit of hope is when they allowed the nine people to go ashore, then we said, maybe there 1s a possibility something will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">We were watching whether they'll allow the kids, the children to be, disembark. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">But as long as they were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> we knew that nothing would happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">QUESTION:  How many children do you think were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> from there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">ANSWER:  I would say close to 100, 150. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Quite a lot of children because they were all families together, not only individual people.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="653">ANSWER:  Right and also my fellow passengers, they were not talking much, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">It was less and less, is like each one was in a different world. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">There was very little communication towards the end, very little communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">It was like something was going to happen, bad and just were just waiting for these things to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">It's like was, you were already in some kind of a mourning type.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">QUESTION:  So basically there was less and less hope?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">ANSWER:  Less and less hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Is like we felt that, we felt that we have reach the end, with no way out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">QUESTION:  Can we go back to the moment when you were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="662">More exactly, that night when you knew that you have to survive, how did you succeed in surviving?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="663">ANSWER:  I tell you honestly, even today I cannot explain why did I survive when everybody else did not and I still don't have an explanation to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And because of that, in the first years after the Shtruma(ph) tragedy, as I could not explain to myself why did I survive, I felt some kind of a guilt, guilt of why am I surviving versus so many people, including the captain, including all the, all the other youngsters that were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , that there were at least as good swimmers and things like that, they have not managed to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And for many years I avoided talking about it, including my wife, because I felt that really I cannot justify why I am still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">With the time, I came to reconcile myself with the fact that just miracles do happen from time to time. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">But I have no explanation because I have nothing special while I was in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> that would have kept me more alive than other people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">QUESTION:  What did you think for, during all this time, when you were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="669">ANSWER:  First of all I was hoping that somebody, somewhere, somehow is going to hear us. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Why us, because I had the chief officer behind me, also yelling and screaming and talking loud and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">So we were so concentrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">He emphasized so strongly that, "Don't fall asleep." </span><span class="sentence" id="673">He emphasized that I should be constantly, if nothing else, we just talking, so that I don't fall asleep and so we were concentrating on that and it's only later, when the, the daybreak came, that I suddenly did not feel him any more, in my back. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">I don't know how long this time has taken, but you know, it was still very, very cold and I was getting colder and colder and maybe I thought, maybe I don't feel any more, something behind me, but then, then I turned around and he was gone, he was laying down.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="675">QUESTION:  Did you get during this time, really desperate?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">ANSWER:  No, it's when I saw him in the, dead in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , then I got really desperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">If he, he was just as alive as I was and then you turn around and he's dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">I said to, I said to myself that that's the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">So at least let's try for the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> , let's try to swim for the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Then when I came back and I saw I cannot get to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> , then I said to , "If I have to drown, I might as well kill myself before I drown." </span><span class="sentence" id="681">So, I had a knife, a pocket knife with me and I pulled it out, but I was unable to open the blade because my hands were frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So while I was struggling with that knife, suddenly I see this big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> towards me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">QUESTION:  What did you, what did you think, what did you feel when you saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rowboat</span> with the Turks coming to, towards you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">ANSWER:  I feel a great relief, was finally they arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I talked to, to them a little bit, they told me that they have seen things floating in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , so they decided to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and see what was going on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">But this just, this 1s the little thing that I could manage to understand from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">QUESTION:  Did you ever have nightmares about, about...
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">QUESTION:  This accident, did you ever...
ANSWER:  I did not have any nightmares because my only guilt in all this tragedy was the fact that I could not explain to myself, why did I survive when so many did not, although so many had the opportunity to survive being in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">That means they were still alive after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> blew and yet none of them, I could not believe that I am the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">There was no ex, even today I cannot explain, why only me, when so many, they were around me in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="691">They could have survived like I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">The fact of this being there eventually, all right? </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Well the chief officer had that opportunity exactly like I had and yet he did not survive either. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And he was not an old man or, or, or a person, you know, having difficulties, he was a strong sailor, he was a sailor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">QUESTION:  Were you dressed perhaps in a different way? </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Let's remember that the water of the Black Sea is very cold in February, compared to the rest of the passengers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">ANSWER:  Well, I had a thick jacket, that jacket was completely wet, so actually that jacket, I felt like taking it out because it was keeping me more cold than <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="698">No, I did not have anything special dressed that, that could have tell me that's why I survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">QUESTION:  When did you, did you start to talk about this voyage?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">ANSWER:  I had several interviews with various news reporters. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">They, they wanted to write an article here and there about my survival and, quite a number of years has passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Before <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , I was not talking to anybody about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Nobody even asked me when I was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> and then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Nobody came to ask me about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">Well, I justified this by, because it was war. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">People were just, people were already, they told me, "Be happy that you are still alive, we don't know what will happen next with that war." </span><span class="sentence" id="707">So, and after the war, while in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , nobody, once or twice some reporter wanted to write an article about or something like that, but nothing really that, you talk to the reporter for a few hours and then that's it and then suddenly an article will appear here and there.</span></p>
