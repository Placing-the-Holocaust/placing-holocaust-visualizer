<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  At what moment did you begin to realize that you were free?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  That moment already, that -- that’s why I was lying there in the -- in the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> , I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But I was so, so weak, that I -- I didn’t want to believe it, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">That it can happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">There, at the -- at the <span class="DLF">roads</span> -- the SS run away and left us there, and mostly -- there was a big, old <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">inn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Very old one, at the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And everybody around into that -- into that <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> and the women from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> already, they were cooking themselves there, on a big, big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , yeah, a -- a wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And I was very cold, I sit down to this -- to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> and wan-wanted to warm me up a little bit at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And a woman said to the other woman, “Give this old man a little warm soup.” </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I was 22 - 23, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So, I got the soup, it was very good, it warmed me up a little bit and they -- they took me to -- to the big <span class="INT_SPACE">ballroom</span> , where the <span class="INT_SPACE">ballroom</span> was like a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , where all around, th-the edges around the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">ballroom</span> was straw, and on the straw, people are lying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Who can walk, walked, who couldn’t walk, died there. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And so the women came there, they saw me sick, they brought me soup and then we see [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Then, after awhile, they heard th-the bombing, the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So they run away further, yeah? </span><span class="sentence" id="147">After the -- the SS, they run. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Wherever they could run, they were running. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And I was there, sick, and I couldn’t move. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And I -- I heard all of these Russians were very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">They were bombing already. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And I knew if I stay in that <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> there, it was right on the <span class="DLF">road</span> , that will not be good. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">They will demolish that. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So, I picked myself up, on m-my four, and crawled about 150 feet or so, deeper into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And th-there was a <span class="NPIP">peasant place</span> and they were not there, the peasants, it was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I went into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , I saw a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , with a big down cover. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I lied down into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , covered my-myself completely over my head with that big down, and forget about everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I was in a coma, right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I don’t know how long I was lying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And -- But suddenly, I hear somebody’s in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And I look up, I see the -- the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> was on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , yeah, and an old woman was crawling around there. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And when she saw me, she got scared and ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I told her that, “You don’t have to run.” </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I knew she was German, yeah, and a peasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I told her, “You don’t have to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I am a sick man, I can’t even move.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="167">Oh, I didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I am sorry, I am sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I will -- I will give you food, I will give you everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Just leave me alone, yeah?” </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I said to her, “All right, I -- I am not doing you nothing.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="172">I will c-cure you,” she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I’Il -- I tell you something, she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">She did. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">She gave me certain things to eat what really started to bring me to my feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">But, it was a long time until I really got to my feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And in st -- meantime, the rations came in and I was again in a coma, covered up, and suddenly he pulls -- a Russian soldier pulls the cover from me and holds the -- the carashneeko on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So, I said to him, “What do you want from me?
