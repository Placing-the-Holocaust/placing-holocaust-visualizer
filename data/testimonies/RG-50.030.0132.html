<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  Not too religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">My father was sort of religious, but the kids weren't too religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Because what was going on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and these pograms and attacks on Jewish, there was no reason to be religious because, you know, a religion is a wonderful thing when you're comfortable and everything goes the way, but if things don't go your way, and you're being murdered for no reason at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And they say...and the expression was God would help. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Religious people always said, "Thank God for that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But you know how much can you thank God for everything is going along, so my brothers were not religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">My father was religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">My mother she tried to keep the religion, but eventually it...it fizzled. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">It was no religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We went to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> because...because to do in respect to the parents, but that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">But not now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  Talk us about how your life changed when...
ANSWER:  Well when...then everything was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">When the war started the...uh...the Nazis came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">They were in 5 o'clock in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">We lived on the <span class="DLF">border</span> , German...<span class="DLF">German border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">They came in 5 o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">The armies marched in. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Powerful army. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I mean as a kid I remember I see Polish armies marching. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">The most powerful thing I ever saw, and they came with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and with machine guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Everything mobilized the proper way. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">The Polish army was riding on horses and the artillery pieces, two horses were dragging the artillery pieces, preparing for the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">They declared war and they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And when they marched in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they put signs on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> that says you know, destroying is very hard...very easy, and <span class="BUILDING">building</span> is very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">All people should live together and get along. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Jews, gentiles, and everybody and building a future because your government was corrupted and from now on everything be fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So we read that sign, figured well it's not too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">How bad can it be. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Okay, a day passed by and the next day we hear...we're sitting 1n the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , you know, everybody sitting, you know, hiding, not to stick your nose out too far, and we hear shooting and shooting and shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">We thought who knows what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">We didn't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">We thought maybe the Polish armies coming back, which was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Then they...uh...the police, the German Gestapo and the SS came into the...to the <span class="DLF">court yard</span> and start screaming we should get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Get out! </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Get out! </span><span class="sentence" id="102">He says and they start saying that someone was shooting at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">That was their excuse to start the trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And they dragged everybody out. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Uh...the...the people which were...my brothers were at the age of 17, 18, or 19, they were dragged down to an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">army camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Me and my mother and my sister...no, my sister wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">My sister was in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Me and my mother and an older brother was dragged into a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">The <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was a block away. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We came to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We saw bodies laying all over....by the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> there laying bodies because they were shooting constantly at anybody who was going, passing by. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">They accused us that we were shooting at them, which I don't believe nobody ever would dare shoot at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Came to the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was stuffed with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">You know, they just stuffed us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">It was so hot that we couldn't breath. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Finally, one German had a pity so he took that long stick to open the...the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , the <span class="DLF">Gothic windows</span> and busted the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">A little air came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Horses were in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">They pushed in horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">They were doing all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And...and eventually L...I looked at the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I didn't see much of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">They had a signed on their buckles, "God with us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="124">You know, ___ that means God is with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">That's...every buckle on the German soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I figured maybe it's true. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">That's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And we stayed there over night. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And meanwhile the...the Pollacks were building <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> for the...when the Germans...for the Germans come in so they're building <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> to protect the...uh...1n case <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> march into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they had some <span class="DLF">holes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> would go into the <span class="DLF">hole</span> and never come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">But this never materialized. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">They filled up all the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> with dead people. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Just piled them up to the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Some was still alive, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">The next day they let us out of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We walked <span class="BUILDING">home</span> side..side...on the side of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">We were afraid to walk in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">You get blown away. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and a couple of days later, everybody was sort of released from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">army camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">My brothers came back and...and it got quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And then we knew already what it...what...what's happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Because you can't...you knew already that they pulled a fast one, what's gonna happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Then slowly, we...they used to come around. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">They...we formed a...a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> was formed like a work for the...the Nazis if need anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">One day they came and they say that the Jews should...uh...give all the cameras....you have cameras. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Then if you have any fur, if you have any expensive <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , so you have to bring it down to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> ...in the <span class="DLF">court yard</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Carried it down yourself, and if they liked it just keep it. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">If they didn't like it, they say bring it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So and then every week was something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And then they start...they see the...uh...they wanted to squash down all these things in case there be a riot or something against the Germans, so they decided to take all the intelligent people and try to put them in...in certain <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> , they put them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And the time when this was going on...for a year, they <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ...they had built a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="152"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . __ </span><span class="sentence" id="153">they called it. </span><span class="sentence" id="154"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">That camp was built for...for people like undesirables they called, and for intelligent people. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Polish engineers, professors, all these people they...they picked up and shipped them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And they shipped them, and a week later the wife or the children got a package in the mail and they opened the packages, there was these clothes over there and they say he died of an incurable disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">This was going on for almost a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And they were sending out everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Anybody who was sort of intelligent, teachers, principals, anything which had something to organize. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">They were afraid if someone would organize, and if they had only a bunch of people, common people, no one would organize. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">This was going on and they were given notice to the community, any Jew has gold he should report the gold and we did that and we did a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Finally, we were start working 1n...in slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">They used to take us out every night. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">There was snow and they dragged us out and put us to the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> in the middle of the night to clean...clean the snow from the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And then they...we had a little <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> where we used to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So they used to take...some pick up...some most beautiful ladies, they picked them up, brought them to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there, raped them and undressed them and made fools out of them, and then they released them. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">That was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">That was no...not as bad then. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And like I said, they're shipping out people this one the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And finally came a time they say we're going to form a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">They want the Jews to be separate from everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">They formed a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> had around 39,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">People...they're weren't so many Jews living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but when the...uh...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed, people from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which suffered more figured they'd come here because this maybe be a little better <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, so people from all over, from the outskirting communities, little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , all came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And it was very crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And that was going on for a short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And then the war...and then the war started between <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and the Russian-Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">The pact was broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And that was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Everything was not bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I mean it was bad, but not bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But when the Germans start losing the war, when the Russians put up a fight and the Germans seen it's not working well, then they start taking care all these...they start going after the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">They decided to...uh...start sending people out. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">They claim they're sending them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So they...uh...took the...took the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">They locked the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">You couldn't get in, get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">All the <span class="DLF">streets</span> were locked with the Gestapo SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And when they locked these things then the...they had a chief of the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">His name was Degenhauf: He came with his cronies and stood in...at a certain <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">He picked a certain <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Everybody got out of this <span class="DLF">block</span> and he was passing by. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And everybody was passing by in front of him, and he decided which way to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Left and right. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I didn't know which way was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Left or right. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Now I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Then I knew what was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So he picked out...let's say he picked out from a block of 10,000 people, he picked out 500, 600 and send them in to a...to a <span class="BUILDING">steel mill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">It was like a...a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ...made a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">People should stay there...send us in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And this was going on, I think, for a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Every <span class="DLF">block</span> , every little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Then 1t came to us, finally came to our <span class="REGION">section</span> , because we looked out the <span class="DLF">windows</span> we see what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">They were shooting and killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Anybody who walked the wrong way was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So when it came to us, we lived in a certain section, so we decided we go up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and break through the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Maybe we'll go to the next <span class="DLF">block</span> , so we'll be able to survive another week. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Maybe they'll change their mind and they would ship us out anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">So we went to the...uh... about two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> away and we stood there. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">We laid in the...the <span class="DLF">yards</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Finally, they took us too. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">They had enough <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trains</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> , so they decided they make a selection and clean out the rest of the <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">When they cleaned...so we were standing in that <span class="DLF">yard</span> , my brothers were still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Not everybody, the older brother with his child was shipped out a day before because he lived in another <span class="REGION">section</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And when they came to our <span class="DLF">block</span> and came into the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , they start looking around, they see too many people because people came from other <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> so they figured they'd scare and they start shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">They saw my brother, so they shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">They chased him and shot him by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage can</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And...uh...and then they made a selection and when to...and I was picked to remain in the...1n these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ...these what you call...they were big <span class="BUILDING">industry building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And they figured they'd stuff us in there meanwhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So I was stuffed 1n in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> with my other brothers and we stood there for a day or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Then they decided they still have too many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">They had a little idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">They had another metal plant there called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Metalubia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">That was a...a metal plant. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">They decided...they must have had 10,000 Jews or more, so they decide they open the <span class="DLF">gates</span> and the same guy stood with his cronies and start picking. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And when I marched through he decided to ship me the wrong way, so I didn't...I had no...I had no idea what's going to be, but I followed. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">If I don't follow, I get blown away, so I walked a couple of feet, maybe 50 feet and I lined up with the...with the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I seen the element which was picked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So I knew I'm...I'm...I'm in bad shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I'm going with the wrong people. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Picked out some old people, some people couldn't walk; some people walked with a crutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">You know, they wanted pure...what you call, a guy who is working, a guy who wore glasses wasn't a candidate to remain either. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">You had to be...look like almost everybody looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">You couldn't look any different. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Okay, so I was picked. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And then the Gestapo was marching us down to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">There were a <span class="BUILDING">freight railroad station</span> , not the main <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">We're marching down; everybody carried their pieces of luggage they had, and they...some of them couldn't carry so the...the SS were whipping them on the way when they carry, so they dropped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> and some other people which lived picked it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Some Polish people jumped out and picked up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They figured get ahold okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">When we came down to the...a...to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , they were stuffing people into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And I seen I be next so I moved back a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I figured if I move back maybe I'll still have a chance to remain, or if they haven't got no more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> , maybe they ship me back to the...to this...uh...what you call <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Metalulia</span> , that <span class="BUILDING">steel mill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Unfortunate, I waited too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">They brought a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with the incurables, and put every body in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And me put in there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Most of them what they brought down were almost half dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">They had...they had typhus and all kind of diseases you could think. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">They stuffed me in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I couldn't breath because they had these medications on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I was a short fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I wasn't tall then. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And I couldn't reach the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">You know, eventually I got stuck by a <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">The <span class="DLF">window</span> was covered with barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">You couldn't get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">So first day I couldn't reach. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">The second day I reached already, because there were so many dead bodies laying, so I stepped on one or two and I reached the <span class="DLF">window</span> and looked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Looked out, I see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> keeps puffing; <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotives</span> keeps going and puffing and puffing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Some people say well, maybe we're going to a...to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , maybe we're going here. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">You know, you always have hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">You can't say for sure...you know, a person lays in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and he says you...he has no chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Eventually some of them come out of too. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And we puffed...1 think the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going for 2 days or 3 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I would say most of them died in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">They couldn't survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And...and when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> arrived in the morning 3 days later, we were going up north. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">We going towards...towards ...uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I don't know if I ever came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Maybe we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Our destination was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malking</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Was a <span class="DLF">junction</span> up north near...pass <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">We got there and...uh...we were all, like I said, there was nothing...just laying with dead bodies and the stench was unbearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">When we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malking</span> ...uh...I...1 looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I see the sun shining; beautiful weather; <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> growing, but nothing for us. (</span><span class="sentence" id="279">crying) Took a half hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">They disconnected the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Had a...Malking was a <span class="DLF">junction</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> was going back south. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I was coming from south, but was south...southeast. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> couldn't come in to...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> had a...a <span class="DLF">platform</span> for four, five...four, five...uh...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So they disconnected and start pushing back. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">I looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and I...I didn't know where I was going. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Finally, they pushed, pushed very slow the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was moving slow, and they pushed me into...to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> ...pushed me in and I looked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I seen Gestapo guards, dogs and guys with whips and waiting and they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and start whipping and hitting people over the head and...and the dead bodies remained. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And...uh...what happened so...I was out too, and pushed me into a little... like a little <span class="DLF">court yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">The <span class="DLF">court yard</span> was a place where everybody got us and they told us to get undressed, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Man, ladies, everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Had some neighbors, very distinguished people. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Her father owned a <span class="BUILDING">drug store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I remember she stood with a kid there and she walked over to the SS, and wanted to ask him, so he whipped her so hard with that whip and then he dropped her on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I don't what happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">What happened there, she died...she died any how. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Then they start picking. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">What happened in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , there were at least 900 or a thousand prisoners which were...didn't have more than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So they needed...because they were killing people like flies so the...the quota was low, so one of the Gestapo decided to pick couple of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I think he picked maybe 10 or 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And I was half undressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">So I see he's picking so I jumped into the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And then we marched away. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">We marched out to the main...main lot where people were dropping clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I dropped...I walked out there and he checked me and looked over and looked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I'm fortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I don't why he didn't kill me immediately because I was half undressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And then what happened...uh...decided there was coffee break or lunch so everybody marched towards the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> because it was around maybe 12:00, 1:00. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So, I marched towards the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , got ahold of a couple rag shirts laying all over, shoes, and...uh...I was safe then. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And the rest of them were send into that <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">From that <span class="DLF">yard</span> , they got undressed and marched into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">You heard screaming fill the <span class="DLF">skies</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">You see mothers with little children on...on the arms walking, you know, screaming and using these...uh... religious like some people are gentile got...when he get's hit, he says, "Jesus Christ.” </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And a Jew gets hit he says____. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">So that's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">They were marching in and when they marched in, they closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> and the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and you heard screaming like people choking to death and a couple of minutes quiet down and that was going on every day I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">That's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Was going on, and my job was the next...uh...in the afternoon, my job was on the...on the main lot to separate clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Uh...Let's say shoes to shoes, wool to wool. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And after that, a day later, they decided the people which are coming into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , they should sep...they should get their clothes...the shoes separate and the clothes separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">When they came out to the <span class="DLF">lot</span> they dropped every piece of clothes on a different...different pile. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">The piles were high. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I would say 3, 4 stories high on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">There were shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Millions, thousands of shoes, thousands of clothes, thousands of...uh...luggages and...and there were big metal boxes standing there and everybody had to throw in if he had some jewelry. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Now everybody, you know, in the old <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , you know, like in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , people have property. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Some cherish certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">In the old <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , if you had a little old ring or a gold watch that was...you...you were cherishing. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">So eventually these boxes used to fill up very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">That's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And they walked in there and they died. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">That's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">This was going on every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And so...and I really didn't know where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I thought, as I was taught in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , that if you go to <span class="NPIP">Heaven</span> or <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">So I thought that maybe I did something wrong as a young kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">You know, you believe in religion because, you know, if a rabbi or anybody else tells you that you...you have to believe in God, so I thought I went to <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> , because I couldn't believe what I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Thousands of people were coming every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And a hour later, puff. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Fired. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">People were coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">The Polish Jews were coming in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">The Jews from the...from the West, these...these people didn't know much where they're going because they lived in better environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">They were more intelligent. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">They didn't believe that...uh... something like this could happen to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">So they came with...some of them came with the maids taking care, and they all just marched in. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">They gave them...some of them gave a piece of soap, make believe they take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and marched in, and that's...that's what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And we lived in the...there were three <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Was <span class="BUILDING">barrack 1</span> , 2 and 3. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">There were two original. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">One with...at night when we marched into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , we were marched in, and the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> was unbearable because people were making on their blankets, but you couldn't walk out. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">There was no such a thing as a...a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> or anything, so people were making on top of it because if you stuck your head out, you got blown away. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And...uh...so we stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And at night some people committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">They couldn't take it, you know, because they knew that...uh...they survived and their children and their wives are dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And...and that's all what was going in these...in these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Every morning we marched out. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">But what happened at...going back to the...to where the...uh...when people came were from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , they...uh...some people got lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Some children got lost or some crippled people came which couldn't march into the...to that <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , so they picked them up on a little...like a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> , you know, piece of wood, and they brought them in...they called it a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , Lazarette. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Had a sign Lazarette. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">What was this Lazarette, was a...a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and two or three people stood there and...and the SS took the guy over or anybody else and he brought him in, he shot him, and then they burned him. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">They put some chemicals on, they burned him. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And that was...the smell was horrocious, impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Sometimes, some children got lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Little kids, 2 years old, | year old, they got lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">So brought them in there and burned them to death because they were...were too much of a deed to bring them there because by the time you bring him there, they're not going to waste any time. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">So that's what it was, so I was there for...for 11 days, struggling every day, seeing killing and hanging. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And they were whipping people. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">If they got ahold of somebody he...I don't know, he did something wrong and maybe he didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">They got ahold of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">They whipped him. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">When they whipped him, you couldn't recognize the color of his skin. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And then they hanged him by his legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Was hanging for 40 minutes, and he was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">This was going on every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Then they had...uh...prepared another <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , <span class="BUILDING">barrack 3</span> , by the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And then there were rumors when this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was ready, they shipped me into this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382"><span class="BUILDING">Barrack</span> was a little better, what do you call, cleaner for the first...uh...couple of days. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">But there were rumors that this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> is going to be liquidated because these are people...so I figured the only way to do is to plan an escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">So I...I planned with another friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Then I got ahold of another friend, people which I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">But...uh...there were other peoples which wanted to escape too. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Kids which I knew from...I lived with them on the <span class="DLF">block</span> , but some of them were sort of...I couldn't trust. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">What do you mean by trust? </span><span class="sentence" id="389">They weren't...they weren't enough...uh...reliable. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">You know, they are kids sometimes 10, 12 years which are very reliable people, and some kids are kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">So I left him back. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I...before I escaped he had a brother working with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">His brother got shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">He was a good looking guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">He looked too good, so maybe they shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">So he was left alone, and he was crying to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">He had trouble with his toes. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">He had ingrown toe nails, the kid, my neighbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">So he was telling me, if you plan anything, take me with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">So I figured dead or alive, it's no time to play games here. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So I got...I got these two other fellows and we planned to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">We says we're going to escape at night because when we by the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and drinking coffee, you know, and we start walking a little away. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">If any...worse comes to worse, they get ahold of us while we're walking too far, we can get a beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">That's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Because they wouldn't bother opening the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> for...for killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So...uh...this guy says, "You go first.” </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And before we escaped, I compared myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I knew if survive it was good to have sugar, and there was plenty food laying which people brought. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">They thought they're going to a picnic. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">So I...I got ahold of a bag...uh...a bag of sugar with a rope and I put it on my neck, so in case I starve sugar would keep me going. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And the other fellows had other stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">So...uh...this guy says, "You go first. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">You go first. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Time is late. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">You go first.” </span><span class="sentence" id="416">So I figured, "Okay, I go first.” </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I went first and I ran into the...uh..behind a...a little...small little <span class="DLF">pool</span> where they were having chickens there. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Chickens and goose were swimming. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I was working there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">So I ran in and I'm waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Finally, another fellow comes. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">My friend comes. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">He ran so fast I ripped his sleeve off on his jacket. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I never seen him. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">When the third one came he ran so fast, but him...I eventually got a hold of. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And we were both stuck in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">We knew that the...the...uh...the...uh...<span class="DLF">towers</span> where they were watching, they're going off 9 o'clock, because if they're pushing you into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and they stay on top with the machine guns, one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> facing the other, if anybody walks out, so what's the use to...to watch the <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">So we waited. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And had...had a plier in my pocket to cut the wires. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And we waited. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Was 9 already, later. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">So we moved towards the <span class="DLF">wires</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I moved towards the <span class="DLF">wires</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And the guy on...on the <span class="BUILDING">tower</span> was sitting up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I don't know if he saw me, if he didn't see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I can't explain. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">His machine gun was just moving back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">We cut the wires. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">We went through the wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">He went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Before we cut the wire, we were walking like the army on our hands and feet because you couldn't stand up or cut the wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Went through the <span class="DLF">wire</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And we ran out, and then we start running and running and running. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">We didn't know where to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">We had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So we ran almost a whole night. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And we said, "If we're going to run, if we want to rest we should at least rest in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Unfortunately, we ran so long that we landed up in <span class="REGION">land</span> , just big <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">So we landed and we couldn't walk anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">So we sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And heavy storm came and soaked us through for hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And we were sitting both holding on to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And in the morning around 5 o'clock, we started looking around. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">We seen a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">A lady walks out from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and she's trying to open her shutters. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So I figured I'll walk over to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So when I walked over, she knew already who I am because they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">She says, "You must have been one from the escapees from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">You better walk away because the SS is coming through here, hundreds of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> going to the farmers to pick up milk and eggs for the...for their food.” </span><span class="sentence" id="461">So we was standing in...the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and waited. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">She says, "You better leave.” </span><span class="sentence" id="463">She says, "Go a little further down.” </span><span class="sentence" id="464">So went a little further down, and then we met somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Somebody got a hold of us and he says to us, "You know, I could save your life and I could do this for you and other things for you 1f you have any money.” </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I had some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I had some Polish money. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So we gave him...he says he's going to go to get us some bread and he could do a lot for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">So we gave him some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">He left. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">When he left, we left because we knew what happened because the Gestapo's gave orders, '1f you bring a Jew, you get a pound of sugar.' </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And if he has good shoes, you could take his shoes too.' </span><span class="sentence" id="473">That was the price the Germans gave to the Polish people, but he didn't get a hold of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">He took off, and we...we marched. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">We marched another couple of miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I got a hold of a...walked into a <span class="BUILDING">farmer's house</span> and the woman was very nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">She came out and walked with me and my friend almost for an hour, showed us to go to another <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Closed <span class="DLF">road</span> where the police is not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">She was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">She came with a little baby on her back and walked and then she left us and she...she made a prayer, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">You know, she took her cross out and made a prayer, God should be with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And we went our way. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Then we walked another, I think, a mile or two, walked into another <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">We told the farmer we want to go to...to a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">He says he's going to take us, but he's not going to walk with us...distance away. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And he opened a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">He says, "In case the SS comes, you just walked in yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I had nothing to do.” </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So he...uh...he walked with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">This man walked so fast that you had no idea, so fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And we followed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Finally, we came to a small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="493">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> name was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soldavna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And he says, "Okay, you're on your own.” </span><span class="sentence" id="496">I says, "No, we're not going to give you the money til you buy us tickets.” </span><span class="sentence" id="497">He got made and bought us tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Went into the...went into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and we sat there. </span><span class="sentence" id="499"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Train</span> was crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">People were going from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to buy some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And I been in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for...overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">In the morming, someone recognized me. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">He must have been some...he says, "There's a Jew in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">There's a Jew in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And he caused a riot. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And he says, "I'm going to get you and I'm going to get to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I can get a pound of sugar ad I can get your shoes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="508">So what happened, most of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> when they come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they...they...they turn into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they have to slow down because there...there's like a curve and they slow down. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">When the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> slowed down, I jumped out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with my friend because I didn't get to the main <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I figured if I get to the main <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , I'd be a dead duck because there's police and Gestapo and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I got up and the other guy jumped off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and then we walked up the <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Got a hold of somebody else and he said he's going to take us <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">His father's a shoemaker and he's going to keep us, and we told him we want to go further. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">We want to go from the...from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> because when we jumped off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ...says we want to go to....uh...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestachowa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="515">He says, "Well, you could sleep over my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and tomorrow I'll take you down to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> .’’ </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Came into his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , me and my friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">We laid down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">We slept for 2 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Then we got up, everything was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Anything we had in our pockets, he took out. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">He left us not even with a cent. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And if you haven't got money where can you go? </span><span class="sentence" id="523">So we told him, "Look, if you give us some money back, keep some of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">If not, we'll blow the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">We're not afraid.” </span><span class="sentence" id="526">We're not afraid to die because we knew we're going to die anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">So he decided to give us some. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And then at night he took us down to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we went towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czectachowa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Same thing in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Much didn't happen because we're quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="531"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Train</span> was crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">When we reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestachowa</span> , the destination...I knew the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> well. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> slowed down on a curve into the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="535">We jumped out, and we walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">We got ahold of another...somehow, she walks in. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">She says, "Well, if you want, you could stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">But I put you in in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">If someone gets a hold of you, I have no part of it.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="540">She let us sleep over. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">The next day she chased us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So my friend says that, "Look. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I have friends here. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Gentile friends which my father used to do business with, so maybe they could hide me out and until the war is over.” </span><span class="sentence" id="545">So I says, "I have some too.” </span><span class="sentence" id="546">So I...he went with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I walked over there and there was a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">bicycle store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I walked in and his wife saw me. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">His wife knew me, and he knew me. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">There were customers in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And he was winking with his eyes I shouldn't say nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And meanwhile he...my friend...was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="553">You know...uh... a <span class="INT_SPACE">country bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I have to tell you, a board in a <span class="DLF">hole</span> , and he was sitting in there because he couldn't stay <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">He says, "I'll wait for you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Spoke to my old friend and he's telling me, he says, "Look, I can do anything for you in money, but I can't help you hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I wouldn't because I could lose my life.” </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I says, "Okay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="559">So I walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I walked toward the...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">He wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">He took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">He decided maybe he do better on his own than with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">So I was left all alone, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">I knew the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I didn't know where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I marched the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , marched up, sideways, all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">How much can you walk? </span><span class="sentence" id="569">You know, you're in danger because, you know, you get picked up, you're dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">So I decided maybe I should...I knew I had a brother working in a...in a...1n a...1n a <span class="BUILDING">steel mill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">He was...he was living there because when the war...when they made a selection, they decided that...uh...they wanted good people. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">They figured if they send him into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they'd never see him, so he remained there. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And they slept there. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">They had a couple of <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> they slept in. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">So I decided, 'let me go down there.' </span><span class="sentence" id="576">I went down there and stood <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I seen a horse with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> turned over right near the plant. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">So I walked over to the guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I asked him if he knows if any Jews live here. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">He says, "Yal, there's some over there working.” </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I says, "Can you call out a guy by that name, "Martin___.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="582">He says, "I go in.” </span><span class="sentence" id="583">He went in. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Took a couple of minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">He walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">He saw me. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">He didn't know what hit him. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Where did I come from? </span><span class="sentence" id="589">What come? </span><span class="sentence" id="590">What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Where's this one? </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Where's the other one? </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And, you know, he took me into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and I explained it to him exact what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">It's unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">He didn't believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And then what they did, they put me up in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in the corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">They were hiding me. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">What to do with me? </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Because they didn't know what to do with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">My brother figured he could remain there, but you couldn't report to the police that somebody else came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Okay, it came at night...people came back from the shift and it's like...uh...they start asking. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">You know, it's somebody came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">After all they were for...for...a couple of weeks along, they didn't know what happened to their wife and children, so they started asking where I come from. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">What it is? </span><span class="sentence" id="605">So I didn't want to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Finally, they forced me to say where I come from so I told them exact what happened to their wives and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">That they're all gassed and died. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">So then they wanted to kill me because I'm lying. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So then they asked my brother if I ever been in a...a emotional sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">They got so furious about it that they squealed on the...squealed the police and if I don't leave, they're gonna report to the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Middle of the night, 1t was 12 o'clock at night or 1:00, I was kicked out and finally the police was notified. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And they came out, start shooting, but I was sitting in..in the...what you call, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">weeds</span> ...the high weeds. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">The dried up weeds. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I was sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Let them shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">My life wasn't worth anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">It was just like you take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wastebasket</span> , throw it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I was waiting to...to die any time. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">What's the use. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I mean it's like you want to dispose of your body. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">It was too much for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I sat there and then it quiet down and they started screaming, "Hurray. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Hurray. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">We got him. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">We got him. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">We got him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="628">I sat there and then I walked away and knocked at another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">The guy was making...uh...funeral boxes on the <span class="DLF">road</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I walked in and he says he can't do nothing for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">The only thing I do 1s get into the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> , stay there, leave the <span class="DLF">door</span> open. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">If you're in there, you sneaked 1n yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I stood there in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">I had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I decided to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">To the same <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Came in again. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">What're you doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="639">So my brother decided we're both go together to see where we could go. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">If we work out, we'll work out. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">If not, we'll both...1f we die, we'll both die. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">So we took a walk in...along side the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> ...was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Took a long <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">We walked a couple of miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Saw a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , little <span class="BUILDING">farmer's house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> must have been maybe 20 by 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I walked in and the wife wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="648">He was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">He looked at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Up and down. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I looked like...ever see a little...a little dog is lost and he knocks at somebody's <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">He felt sorry for me and he says he can't do nothing til his wife come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And meanwhile go into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="654">The same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Stay in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">My brother had to run back to the plant. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">If they see he's not there, if they get ahold of him or they find him out of the plant he gets shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">So he was...he left and then his wife came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she fell in love with me and she says, "Yal, we're gonna keep him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And I was there...the first day I was very useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">I used to clean the cows, clean the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , wash clothes for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And that's what I did for almost a whole month. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And they got so used to me that they didn't want me to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Mine clothes I used to wash. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I used to get insects in my clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">They had a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">So I used to take my clothes and put it to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and put a rock over it, so the...the water was floating down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , took all the insects out. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And I lived there for a month, you know, every night, you know, they were used to me. __ </span><span class="sentence" id="669">and taking care of all the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And then my brother came once and he says, "They're forming another little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Because from the 39,000 everybody was liquidated, and there wasn't much left. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And they didn't want the Jews to live in the <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> because they were shabby <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Decided to take the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span> and close in the <span class="DLF">blocks</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">The <span class="DLF">blocks</span> must have been what?...500 or thousand feet a <span class="DLF">block</span> , close in the sides, so they closed up three <span class="DLF">blocks</span> , four <span class="DLF">blocks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And...and these people which lived in the...uh...plants...they had some people coming down. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Let's say you picked out...Let's say 5,000 people in a <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> , they picked out a hundred and they gave them a certain section, and they said, "You make room for you people which come in.” </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So...so they organized a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">A small, little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And I found out, so I says, "I'm going to go into the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="680">So when that plant was marching in, a day shift...1t was a day shift and night shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">So my brother says you stay aside of the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">When you're marching in, you jump into the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="683">That's what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I waited. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">The man in charge, the German policeman was an old man. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">He rode on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="687">He couldn't tell the difference from this one or the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Marched into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and...uh...met my brother and...uh...met my brother there and my mother was still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">My moth...my mother was hiding in a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , you know, who had...who had build a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and we ripped out the <span class="DLF">door</span> and we glued up the <span class="DLF">door</span> with bricks. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">It looked the same so you couldn't tell she was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">She was hiding there for 4, 5 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Finally, they couldn't take 1t any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">There were children in there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And the childrens were crying and someone heard the kids crying and they knew they're people hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">So they opened the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">The shot more...half of the people were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">My mother sort of survived with my...my sister-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And...uh...they brought in there...they remained in the little...the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699">They stood in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> over there for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And what happened with me is I marched into the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I met them. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">My mother was still there and my sister-in-law was there with the little kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And every day what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Shoot a hundred. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">Shoot 2 hundred. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">One day they came and said...uh...we want all the...uh...intelligent people which was left. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">We have an order from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708"><span class="COUNTRY">England</span> sent us a...a cable that we want all these intelligent Jews to go...to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or...<span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> then. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">So people were...figured they'd take any opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">So they loaded up about 5, 6 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with 5, 6 hundred people and they took them down to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and they threw in and shot them in a common <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="711">That was the end of these. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">That's was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And then we lived in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in fear every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">One day I had a friend who just came from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">He got a hold of a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">He bought a gun because he figured he couldn't take it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">If he has to die, he's going to take some...some Germans with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">So one day they picked him up and...uh...you know, they always looked to...anybody looks suspicious...you walked the wrong way, you were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">So one day, he walked and they had a little...a little <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">A little small <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> by the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where anybody was suspicious was thrown in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And then...uh...1f they were in a good mood, they let you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">If not, they shot you in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">There was a...a place where the people used to keep ice, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Here they have refrigeration. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Then they used to go...in the winter used to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and chop the ice and put it into that <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">So used to shot into. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">So...so one day, he had a gun on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">He had bought a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">So when they took him out and they start shooting people in this...this little <span class="BUILDING">market</span> , he pulled his gun out and wanted to shoot this German guy but unfortunate, his gun was so old, rusty, that it didn't fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">So what he did...he couldn't shoot him so he jumped on him and bit his throat. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And meanwhile the other SS saw what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">They shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Then they decided...what happened every 10s going to be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">So they took people out. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I know there were a thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And every 10 was shot and brought in the bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">No, they brought the bodies into the <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">There is a big <span class="DLF">yard</span> , and everybody had to go and see, and they were laying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">That's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And then this was going on, I think, for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Was miserable living this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="742">There was no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">We were buying sometimes <span class="NPIP">outside</span> anything we got a hold of. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Horse meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Anything! </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">The <span class="NPIP">place</span> was diseased. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Was filthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">People were stuffed in in <span class="NPIP">places</span> , you know, so then what happened they decided they're going to liquidate that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="751">There were I think 6,500 Jews lived in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , liquidation. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">What do you do with my mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="753">My mother couldn't walk out and...and face the music because she looked old. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">She wasn't old, but she didn't look young enough to be that, so we decided we're going to put her in in a <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , a little <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> over the <span class="DLF">court yard</span> , a little <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and my sister-in-law with the kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And this was going on for the time we were in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="756">They were looking for old people and children, so we made a false <span class="DLF">door</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">It was dark, upstairs, old shabby <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so we...we...we...uh...made a double <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Nobody knew, but somebody...there's always trouble-makers. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And there were people which were sympathizing with the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">They figured they survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">So one guy came and he said, "This is not...this is a false <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="762">There's somebody in there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="763">So he...the Gestapo said, "No, that's no false.” </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And he said, "Yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And they busted the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And my mother was in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And my sister-in-law was 1n there, and the little child was in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">But that little child was so sharp, each time he heard noise he jumped into a big pot and put a cover over it so nobody knew he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">He survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">My mother survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">When they came in...the police came in...there was some Jewish police came with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And the Jewish police knew my brothers, so they start screaming, "Where's the old lady? </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Where's the old lady?" </span><span class="sentence" id="774">So I says, "Aw, you got the wrong information.” </span><span class="sentence" id="775">He walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And this was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And then there was no more hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Nothing to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">So we formed ourself over the <span class="DLF">court yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">It was like a little <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="782">There was a little...like a little small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had an <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="783">So we figured if they'd be a selection or liquidation, we knew the liquidation is coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">This is not going to be forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">A matter of time, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">So we decided we're going to put them up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Anytime we went to work in the morning we marched out because we used to march out like we used to shape up. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">We had kapos. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">What do you mean a kapo? </span><span class="sentence" id="790">A kapo was a foreman. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">He had his group. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">500 men. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">200 men. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">When we marched out in the morning, we had to meet 1n front a big <span class="BUILDING">market</span> and the Gestapo checked out how many you got? </span><span class="sentence" id="795">How many you got? </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And we assigned jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">The jobs were various jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Some jobs...mine job was to work on the <span class="DLF">Russian cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">The Russian soldiers they captured...the Russian soldiers from the war, so they brought them into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and never gave them any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">They gave them raw potatoes and they died on dysentery, all kind of diseases. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">So mine job is to work on the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , dig <span class="DLF">holes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="802">They used to bring <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> loads or...or thousands of Russian soldiers and...uh...they used to roll off there...ever see, like you know how you see in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> when they bring a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage truck</span> to a <span class="DLF">dump</span> , the opened the back and out. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">That's the way they used to roll out and you know, I had...I had feelings all the time to people, any people. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">I always used to say when I used to stay there with my friends, we used to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">I used to say, "Here, look at this. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">So many thousands of people laying in this <span class="DLF">hole</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="807">crying) I says, "So many thousands of people laying in this <span class="DLF">hole</span> and a mother...a mother somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> is waiting for her son to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And he's dead.: </span><span class="sentence" id="809">Thousands...thousands of Russian people were waiting for their sons to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the war and meanwhile they were laying 1n that <span class="DLF">ditch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="810">Thousands of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And this was going on for weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">Eventually, they decide to liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="813">By liquid...

<p><span class="sentence" id="815">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="816">QUESTION:  Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="817">This is a good stopping point. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
ANSWER:  So they...uh...before liquidation, they used to come in...Gestapo on Sunday, like the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Lufbafer</span> , that was the air force. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">They had nothing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">They figured let's go down. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">We'll make some...make some trouble for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">They used to walk in and kill people, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Like some people might say today, "They followed orders.” </span><span class="sentence" id="824">A lot of 50 or 70 percent was no follow orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">They came in and shoot and kill just for fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And did a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">They found a man with a beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">They burned his beard or they did a lot of crazy things they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">They used to carry on something. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And that was going on...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was...each time you marched in at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">What we used to do, when we walked out to work, at night we used to march in and carry food. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Somebody carried a bag of potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">One carry a half a bag of onions, carrots, peas, anything you can get ahold of. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">So they used to surprise it. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">When we used to march and turn the corner, we were a thousand feet away, we saw them standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">As soon as we saw them standing, we dropped the bags because if you brought in food, you got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">So we dropped the bags. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Sometimes they weren't there so we started marching so fast, and the police stood by the guard...the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="839">They said, "Come on. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">Move. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Move. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Move." </span><span class="sentence" id="843">before they come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">That's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">So we were lucky and we brought some stuff in. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">Brought in meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Who knows? </span><span class="sentence" id="848">Dog meat, horse meat, anything you got ahold of. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">The horse meat you could tell apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">It was red. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">More red than normal meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And this was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">They used to come in and they used to say...see a mother with a child...uh...with two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">They used to walk over, "Give me one of your child. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">One I want. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">Pick which one you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">If not, you get killed.” </span><span class="sentence" id="858">So the mother didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">What should she do? </span><span class="sentence" id="860">How can she give away one? </span><span class="sentence" id="861">So he shot them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">That's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">That was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">That's what the German...German...not only the German people. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">The German people knew too what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Some people say they didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">They...they used to smell the odor in...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> for miles away. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">It's like chicken feathers. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">People...my brother tells me he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , that they used to march. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Thousands of miles they used to march when the Germans...the Russian used to advance, so they didn't want to leave the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">They used to march. _ </span><span class="sentence" id="872">On a march, there used to be, I think, 3, 4 hundred thousand prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">All types. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Not only Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">All nationalities used to march. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">American soldiers too included. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Anybody couldn't walk, he just took the rifle and threw him in the...threw him along side the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="878">Thousands of them died. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Thousands. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And then when they didn't have no food...they ran out of food, so they...they killed the horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And they ate part of the food, but this was rough in general. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">But going back to the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , finally the...the Jews got smart and says, "We're going to try to defend ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">What we're going to do, if the Germans come in and start liquidating, we're going to give him a...a little fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">But what happened the Germans had a lot spies. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="886">They had people moved into little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Ifa guy was deaf and dump, he wore a yellow band with 3 black marks...markings, 3 black dots, so we know the guy can't talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">He can't speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And the moved in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And he most have been set up by the...by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And he sort of knew what was going on and meanwhile the Jews in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> used to make hand grenades. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">They used to take aluminum and...and pour it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">You know, primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And then had a lathe grind it and clean it and cloth it with the dynamite. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And they had this prepared, you know, and we had built a <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="896">What we did, we collected pickle barrels and we were digging a <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Each time we did a distance, we pushed a barrel, pushed a barrel, not to walk out but to crawl out and this supposed to been...the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> 's supposed to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="898">Eventually, they got all the information what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">Got ahold of everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">Anybody who was in the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> was killed because they put gas in or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And anybody who was caught was shot on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And that was the end of...the...uh...preparation for the...for the battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And then they came in and start liquidating the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="904">They took people down. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">They took <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> loads down to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and shot them right in the <span class="DLF">grave</span> , and they...they killed people and people and people. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">My mother was hiding in that little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with my sister-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">They were there quite awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">We were trying to make contact with some people which knew...knew a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">They were closer to the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Maybe we can get them out or what or when. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">But what happened...the Germans, after they cleaned out the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they blew every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> up. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">They were old, little shabby <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="913">You could have pushed them with a...with a strong hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">So they were blowing up the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> after another cause they didn't want to show it's there. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">So when they're blowing up the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , my mother and my sister-in-law walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">They walked out, and Gestapo got ahold of them and put them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and says, "Don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">We'll take you here and there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="918">My sister-in-law and the kids...took them down to the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> and shot them in the same <span class="DLF">grave</span> and that was the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">That's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">That was the end of my mother ad my sister-in-law and the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And then they decide to put us back in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">plants</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Build <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and put us back in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">plants</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="923">The same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="924">The <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> was the <span class="BUILDING">Hassack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="925">That was a company...a company from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Original, we used to make...uh...what you call? </span><span class="sentence" id="927">The Germans had no gas so they built like little...little ovens in the back of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> or back of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Used to put in hard wood and close it. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">The gas from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> used to push the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="930">We used to do that from the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">Then the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">plant</span> changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">We start making ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I was...what happened, the day they liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I remained tn the plant. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">Never went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="935">So I didn't go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep, so we slept on the cement. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">The hardest thing was to sleep on the cement. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">You know, you couldn't...you turned and twist...there's nothing...the only thing you did to put your hand to your elbow on top under your head. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And each time they came in, they shoot...they were shooting people like mad. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">If they were looking for somebody suspicious, everything was suspicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">Let's say they looked for a guy...uh...uh...John Doe. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">So if there were a hundred Joe Doe's, they killed a hundred John Doe's so they know they killed the one they supposed to. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And so...That's why had different names in difference birth certificates and all this, but after that the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> passed a law that these people can get away with it for that only reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">So I was stuck in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with my brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">It was very rough. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">No food. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">You know, no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">The hardest thing was to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And...uh...and I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">Mine job was, unfortunately, there some...were some good. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And I was what you call working 1n a division where they didn't need me. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">I wasn't necessary needed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">But eventually I pushed myself into a <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> where I got...I worked very hard, but at least I was needed because I was afraid if I'm not needed, I'd be going. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">So I eventually...we stood there for awhile, whether I think a week or two, and then they decided to...to make another selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">They figured they're going to take out people which they don't want. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">One was too heavy. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">One was too skinny. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">One wore glasses, and one looked funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">And every...uh...what you call boss, meister. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">They called them meister. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">Let's say, every boss was in charge...let's say, like mine...the German which was in charge of mine group, he...the Gestapo gave him orders, "You take out the ones you don't want.” </span><span class="sentence" id="961">So he picked. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">Eventually, I wasn't working there anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">The whole...the whole brigade went. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">The whole brigade went. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">Well, I worked in another division. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">I worked in a <span class="BUILDING">machine shop</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">I was more needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">So what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="969">They made another selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">But they were afraid that this 1s not going to go by so easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">People might revolt, so they took them out separate, 2, 4, 6, 8 and stuffed them down in a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="972">There were about 5, 6 hundred people in that <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="973">They were afraid if they would march them out and put them on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> they might start jumping off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , so there was a...uh...what you call ___, that's a...the building industry, German fellow by the name Mosche, was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">He came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="975">He was what you call a boovon, a goovon, tough guy, you know, a German tough guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">All of them were tough, but he was the one who says he's going to do it, so by taking the people out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , they let them out 2 at a time, he stood with a sledge hammer, hit everybody over the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">So anybody came on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was laying half dead and...and he locked and put him up and covered the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with blankets and took him down to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And that's the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And then we remained in that little <span class="NPIP">place</span> there, I think, I think, for 2 years... 2 years over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">Misery, shooting, killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">My brother was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">My brother...uh...was walking once, and there were a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came and with potatoes, and a potato fell out of the...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , so he picked it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">We always walked with little potties, because you never knew when you get ahold of some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">So he had the pot, and a Gestapo passed by. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">He see he carries the pot, and was a potato in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">And they wanted to know where he got the potato. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">He says he picked it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">They didn't believe him, so they took him down to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="989">He was there, I think, a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">My brother told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">I wasn't there any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">I went to another <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">My brother told me that you couldn't tell his color, what color he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">He was blue. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">And...uh...finally couldn't get out of him because he didn't anything, so one day this...uh...Gestapo man came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">His name was Stiglitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">He was a short fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">He was a midget, very short. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">With a gun he carried...the revolver he carried was almost as big as he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">And he took...went down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and he told him to walk out, told him to pick up two pails of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">And he walked with the two pails of water out toward the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , and he shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">So he figured if him, the pail of water go over him so he wouldn't make a mess. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">So my brother was shot then, and my other brother which worked in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> took him down to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and buried him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">And there were other incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">There were...there were...there was...there were...uh...killed with diseases. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">People died on typhus....the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">I had cousins, relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">They died every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">You spoke to somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">You see him now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">The next day he was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">They put them in paper bags. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">They had big paper bags. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">Shoveled them in and every day, they carried down to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> people and people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">There was another section for incurable diseases in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">Was circled around with wires. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">So they used to take people down to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">And had nothing to do, for fun they used to give them a broom and sit them into the <span class="DLF">grave</span> and shot them sitting up, standing up, and all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">That was going on with these people which claimed they..they followed orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">That's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And that was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">All ___ we worked hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">And then what happened mine division decide to move to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">Not far, maybe I would say in mileage, 10 mile, 20 miles, another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">I worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hassack Pilsary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">That was...uh...that was a division from <span class="BUILDING">Leipzig Hassack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">The company Hassack like...uh...uh...uh...like you take <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1028"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> has a division too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">Hassack Pilsary had a division. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">Yugosnyder that's another company had a division. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">And I worked for Yugosnyder and shipped me to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">I was with my brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">When I was with...with my brothers, I sort of managed...you know...uh...certain time in the day when we got around after work, 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock everybody had something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">One had a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">One couldn't eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">One...we were wheeling and dealing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">Let's say, you gave me half a onion, he gave me a haircut. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">I gave you half a potato, you gave me half a carrot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">And that was...and you gave me a piece of thread to pick my pants, I gave you a needle, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">And that's the way we operated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">When I got...when I left, I got to the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> I was very miserable. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1042">Pause) (Crying) I was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">I must have weighed...who knows how...how much I weighed? </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">I worked and what happened in the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ...had people from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">They were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">People came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">There was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">They called it like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">Certain sections, these people came there, there were tuffies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">Tough, tough people, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">They only left the undesirable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">The intelligent they killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">So they were tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">And each time if there was some work to do, they grabbed us because we were the newcomers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">Took me down to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> to break up monuments and build the <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">And made me a fireman because any time, I don't know if was <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> or Russian...most <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American planes</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">English planes</span> used to come over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">They used to flight at night, and each time this happened, they set off an alarm that we should go to the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> and stay there because, in case...uh... something happened, we should be prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">I was a fireman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">What I had in my possession is a little pump and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">I was the fireman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">I was so sick I used to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> 20 times a night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">Even if I didn't need it, I walked because I had no feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">And I used to carry a blanket with me...blanket, covered myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">Cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">I was shivering and walked back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">And that's the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">And I had a neighbor...a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">He worked the day shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">I worked the night shift, then we changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">I don't know if he was old or young. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">I couldn't tell his age. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">He was very nice to me, and he was like a father to me then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">Because we were both...so we both shared the blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">The blanket had more patches than the blanket, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">But he used to be a...a tailor from years back, so for him to take the needle out and stitch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">So he used to help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">Each time I came I was downhearted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">I figured who needs this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">So he always used to encourage me, encourage me, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">And...uh...he used to do work, and I used to be in charge of machines. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">I used to be in charge of bullet machines. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">I didn't know much, but I learned a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">The Germans had no equipment any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">They ran out of tools because the Americans were bombing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> and...and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swinford</span> and all these industries where the German had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">They had no oil. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">They gave us oil to oil the machines. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">It was like kerosene. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">It wasn't slippery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">Anything went wrong, we were blamed for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">One day...uh...one day, he gave me a part for a machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">He says that's the only part he has. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">If you break it, you be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">What can I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">I could only put in the part. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">I put in the part and the machine slipped because it didn't perform the job because there wasn't enough oil to slip the...the machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">So I broke it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">So he took me to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> , you know, and they gave me such a beating that I fainted and they threw me into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bath tub</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">Then took me out, and gave me another beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">Then the next day, the...the...the boss who is charge of me, Mr. Ginter, he found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">So he says to the other boss, "Why did you do that to him?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">He says, "Well," he says, in German,"___———S—S—C Means gotta turn to victory, and this man didn't perform. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">I managed to stay on my feet, holding on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">I couldn't hold on to my thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">I was so beaten up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">But he let me live, because if it would have been somebody else, I would have been dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">He knew me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">He knew me for 2 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Why was I...was he...he is, what you call...there's good enemies and bad enemies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">He was a good enemy, what you call. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">He treated me...you ever see, you beat sometimes a dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">You beat him so long that you have no use beating him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">You get used to him, so you beat somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">He always picked on somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">So he let me just live and finally he slipped in once a little cup of soup he got from somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">He came to me...he says to me, "I'm going to give you a loaf of bread, if you tell me who's going to win the war?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">I says what a...what a question to ask me, who's going to win the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">I says, "I think..” He says, "Think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">Think about it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">So I think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">I figured I be dead by the time he comes back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">Came back 2 days later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">He says, "Who's going to win the war?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">I says, "You. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">He gave me such a beating again, the same guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">He threw me on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">He kicked me and kicked me and kicked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">Finally, I got up and...and managed a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">It was a weekend so we didn't work on Sundays. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">So I laid in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">There was some doctors there which weren't... nobody knew they're doctors...had some medication and some water and I bounced back pretty fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And that's where I spent my time over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">It's terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">That thing was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">You couldn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">You couldn't...a guy used to come at night....at the night shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">We used to work night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">He came in and he used to insist...1f we make a hundred percent he gives a...a loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">A loaf of bread was let's figure what you call...1t was a kilo?...let's figure a regular loaf of bread, a round loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">How do you make a hundred percent if you haven't got the machinery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">I had girls working for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">You know, I had about 6, 7 girls working, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">We used to share even what we had...even...even a <span class="DLF">pit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">Anything we shared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">They were nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">And there were some girls from...which were shipped from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">Very nice girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">And they used to help, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">Not with food, but...uh...morally, they used to perk you up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And I had friend which worked with me which died, you know, so I was left without him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">He used to help me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">And anytime the machines broke, what happened...these girls never ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">And the Germans used to shave their hair off and put like onion bags on top of them, made out of three <span class="DLF">holes</span> for the head and for the two arms, and that's the way they used to walk around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">They had never dressed, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">And you know how a woman has to take care of herself more than a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">They looked awful, but they were worked with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">And anytime machine was broke and he came back and he got mad, he took and shot her in the <span class="DLF">back yard</span> right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">So there's one left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">That's the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">But...uh...1t was part of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">I...uh...I didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">I couldn't wait it's going to be me, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">But how do you get rid of this misery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">And...he used to be...he used to drink a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">This...uh...German, who used to be in charge of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">His name used to be Prosser. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">Prosser. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">He came back from the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">He lost two fingers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">So he wasn't good for the army, so they sent him to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">He knew about machinery like I know how to be an astronaut today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">But okay, maybe he had some relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">And he came with his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">His wife used to be a blonde. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">She used to be so experienced slapping people, I don't know how fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">You didn't know what hit you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">She slapped you on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">Even if you...you moved away, you couldn't miss her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">So fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">Left and right, she used to slap. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">She slapped...the woman used to slap, and kick em, and spit on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">That's what she used to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">But she was nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">She saw that each time she saw me...not that she greeted me, but she threw sort of a friendly...not a smile, but a friendly look. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">That's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">And...uh...she used to help me sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">You know, I used to say, "Can you give me some bread.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">She says, "I'm not allowed to.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">But what she used to do, each time she passed by the machine, she made believe she dropped something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">She looked at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">Sometimes a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">But I used to work at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">I used to work at night, so I used to go into his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> because if I needed a part, I went into his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">So he was sleeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">He soundly slept, and he had a little satchel where he kept his food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">So if he was sleeping, he was drunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">I took a sandwich out from his...uh...uh...attache case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">And I ran into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">The <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> wasn't cleaned for 5 years, so the odor and the salami sandwich sort of the combination, people were sitting there, they couldn't tell that I'm eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">Then I washed my mouth out with water and say, "What are you eating?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">I says, "No, I got ahold of a piece of...uh...garlic.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">And got away with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">That's helped me, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">Sometimes, some day, I went up and he was sleeping, I saw an apple. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">I took in an apple. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">For me to eat an apple, for me to eat a...a...salami sandwich, is like for somebody giving a shot to think that...that sandwich used to go into my stomach is like you're dropping a...a something to an empty barrel, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">But I was swollen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">I didn't feel good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">I was...I was a mess. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">I was a mess already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">Finally, what happened, tn...uh...one night I was working, so friend of mine...friend, he was passing by with a...with a metal, little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Was carrying something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">And I had no shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">I was wearing wooden shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">So he went in back of me, and he ripped my skin off from my feet, you know, not knowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">So I turned around and I rapped him in the mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">So the...the...uh... the police saw it, took my name down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">The next day they took me to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> , and they gave me a beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">So one guy tipped off said, "Leave him along. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">His brother just died, so give him a break.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">They gave me a...a less beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">But that's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">They used to carry on terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">Terrible things used to go...used to go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">And then what happened finally...finally, the Russian army started advancing closer to...to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because the Americans helped them out with arms, with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> because they were really in bad shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">So they start advancing and the army was very powerful, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">Good soldiers they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">They started reaching already closer to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">So they decided they didn't want to leave nobody, so they...they set up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">They had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">They made you walk on the...on the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">And shipped...shipped most of the...rest of the Jews to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">I was sort of the...uh...the old coot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">My boss thought that the Germans could fight off the onslaught from the Russian army, so eventually the fight...1f he's safe, I'm safe, so he could open himself a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">And slaves there's enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">If there wouldn't be no Jews, there would be Pollack. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">They wouldn't be no Pollacks, there'd be others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">Gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">There were plenty, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">So I remain...I...I was left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">I had...my clothes I didn't have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">The only thing I had one shirt...uh...polyester shirt which was already in shreds from washing in detergent, and I had a pair of pants which was ripped and was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">Each time it blew, it like air condition over <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">And I was cold all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">And...and they start taking people out of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">Everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">This guy left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">The guy which used to be in with me sharing the blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">They took him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">And I was holding on to the..uh...to the boards where we were sleeping cause I couldn't stay on my feet because I was too weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">So I remained and they shipped everybody out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">At night...the same night after they shipped him, some were caught at the...the Russian army caught the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and busted the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> up and let the prisoners out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">And some of them...and the Germans took off at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">They didn't take no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">They walked on their...on the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">So some of the Russian army got ahold of them and shot them right on the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> and some of them escaped, but some of them most of the Jews were shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">They were shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">My brothers were shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">Some came back and some didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">And I was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">That's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">I was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">I was liberated and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian trucks</span> and army came in and looked around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">So many sick and dead people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">Some died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">The flies were eating them alive and the insects and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">And I remained in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with not too many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">Many people...some of them which were stronger were running toward the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> to pick up rifles when the German...uh...picked up rifles and they were shooting in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">And I figured, "Hey, this is not for me here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">If they ever come, we're finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">Not that...I was finished anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">I could hardly walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">So I figured I take my little...uh...can I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">I had all the time with me like a gallon paint. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">It was a can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">And I used to make 1n that can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">I used to eat in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">can</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">I used to do everything in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">can</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">That can used to be for every use, what human use you could use. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">And that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">Sometimes I didn't wash it because I figured, "Who cares.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">Didn't bother me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">So I decided I take that can and my wooden shoes I had and which were ripped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">They...I couldn't even walk in them anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">They were...and I decided I leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">Because I was liberated in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , I figured I march out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">If I marched out, it took me awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">I marched. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">Some people say, "Where you going.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">Said, "I'm going.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="1293">Oh, you live in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">So you must know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">You got your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">They thought I got a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">I got a <span class="BUILDING">mansion</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">There was nothing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">I was a poor...poor family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">Marched out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> where I lived was destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">The <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were blown up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">There was nothing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">I marched into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">Came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">Russian soldiers were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">Were hunting down the German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">Most of the SS were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">Some of them were hiding in the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German trucks</span> where they keep the tools, like big drawers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">They shoved themselves in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">The Russians were very mad at them because, you know, the Russians lost over 20 million people, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">They treated the Russian very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">So they grabbed them out and shoot them and shot them and...and then they went to liberate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">There was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">People were almost dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">There wasn't much left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">They were sick and dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">They liberated that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and put them on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">Put them into <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">And then the liberation started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">And we were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">Not for too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">Then they...what happened, the..uh...the underground...Polish underground starts fighting, starts looking for scapegoats again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">There was some Jews left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">So they figured they were...there were 3, 4 different organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">There was a...the exile government in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> had a....an organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">There was a communist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">There was other organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">They were fighting between each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">And, you know, there weren't too many Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">There must have been maybe 500 or 700 Jews from that population close to 40,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">And which <span class="NPIP">side</span> do you take? </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">So they accuse us, we're taking this <span class="NPIP">side</span> , the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">So they start shooting Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">I figured that's no good, so decided to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">So I look the...I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with some other people and smuggled myself into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">From <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , I stood there for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">I met a...a Jewish family, and they keep meeting over night there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">I went with my other brother, the two brothers we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">Because we didn't want to go as a group because if we get caught, we're better off going separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">My other brother crossed the...the <span class="DLF">border</span> between...uh...<span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1342"><span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> we stood a couple of days then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carls...Carlsbad</span> ____. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">That was the <span class="DLF">border</span> between the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">We crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">The American soldiers were standing and questioning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">If you were coming from the east, they say, "You go back to the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">Wait til they...they ship you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">If you were coming from...from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , from the West, they say, "Go back to your west. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">When the repatriation would start, then they ship you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">But unfortunate, I had a piece of paper that I... came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czectachowa</span> and the American soldiers saw <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestachowa</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestachowa</span> sounded like <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">The stamp was the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">He couldn't tell the difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">And he asked me where I'm coming from. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">I says, "I'm coming from the west. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">I want to go east.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">So he says, "No, you can't go east. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">Go back to the west.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">And I was really coming from the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">So he let me go over the <span class="DLF">border</span> and then I went in over the <span class="DLF">border</span> and then...uh...I walked across...a day and went into a small, little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">Uh...Hof, that's where Secretary of State Kissinger was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">Stood there a couple of hours, then we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and proceeded to a bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">So I went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bamberg</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bamberg</span> a couple more Jewish people lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">And I stood there for awhile, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">And it wasn't good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">You know, it was rough til I got a little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to live in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">I didn't want to live in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">Lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with no <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">We struggled...struggled in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">And then...then the UNRRA came, start helping out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">And there were a lot of Jewish soldiers in the American army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">So what happened...most anybody, wasn't only the Jewish soldiers...the...the Gentiles, anybody wanted to give their food away because they...they didn't want to eat that kind of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">The white bread and the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">For American soldiers, was no good because this wasn't the best food, but for us it was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">So what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">Everyday the Chaplain came down with the...with the...with the little hookup, the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and brought us food into the little
