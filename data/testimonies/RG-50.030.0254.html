<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Can you tell us first about your parents and what they did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  My father was a chemical engineering. (</span><span class="sentence" id="9">Clearing throat) And he worked before the war in the petroleum industry which was concentrated in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="REGION">southeastern region</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My mother was a <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> teacher and...uh...my childhood was I think characterized by the very few years during which my parents lived together because of the economic conditions in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Uh...My father had a job in one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My mother was assigned to teach in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in another part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and it was not until 2 years before the war when we were finally together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  What did that mean for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Where were you living as a very young child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Well...uh...I spent my childhood in...uh...a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...uh...village of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilena</span> , in <span class="REGION">Kielce region</span> which is about 20 kilometers east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My mother taught in the 7th Grade elementary school in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And only during the summers and occasionally during the holidays I remember seeing my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I had a nanny, a village woman, who took care of me when mother taught until I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at the age of 6 which was...required special permission because children were not sent to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> until they were 7 in those days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Why were you sent so young?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  I guess I was able to read and...and was anxious to learn and...uh...but I guess they let me. (</span><span class="sentence" id="21">Laughing)
QUESTION:  What was those early years like? </span><span class="sentence" id="22">What was life like for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Uh...It was...uh...a very interesting life from the point of view of...uh...feeling, missing my father without realizing that I missed my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Living in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> that was populated by...uh...typical Polish farmers, peasants, but curiously enough, there were several Jewish families that lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And one of the most curious things that remained with me is that there would be some of them who were farmers, along with Polish farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">In one particular part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> there was...uh...a family named Koch (ph) a Polish family, farming and right next to them was a Jewish named Katz (ph) and farming also. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And, of course, only later that Koch (ph) and Katz (ph)...the Cat... the same name. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And there were few Jewish...little <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> that were...that were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And...uh...but the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was obviously predominantly Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">My childhood was exploring such things as...as baking potatoes in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> in the fall after the harvest, going with other little boys and finding potatoes that people forgot to pick or didn't...missed them and baking them in the...in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , burning my lips and on hot potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">To this day, my favorite food. (</span><span class="sentence" id="32">Chuckle) (Pause) I had a younger sister, Helena. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Marga. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Uh...The strongest memories are of holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Christmas tree. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">My father pretending to talk to the angel because in Polish Catholic tradition, it was the angel that brought the gifts at Christmas time. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">St. Nicholas came on December 6 and put things under the pillows of good children. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Bad children got little twigs. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">We got both. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So it was...uh...a rather confusing message that we were getting. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I guess we were getting a message that we were alright, but we were not perfect.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  What happened as the war grew closer? </span><span class="sentence" id="44">You became older. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Uh...As you became a young teenager, where did you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Well, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> until 1937 and in 1937, after a long struggle, my parents managed to obtain a permission from the Polish...pre-War Polish authorities that my mother could be transferred and could teach in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in which my father was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Uh...A rather unbelievable situation for us today in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , but it was common place in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So in 1937, we moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilena</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> and we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boleslawiece</span> , which was a sort of a equivalent of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , of...of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And we...there I lived with my father for the remaining 2 years before the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And there I went to a <span class="BUILDING">private elementary school</span> which was called ___ (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And...uh...finished the last grade which I believe was 6th and took my entrance examination to what was called <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , beginning of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , roughly equivalent in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And that's when the war broke out in September 1, 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Tell us about it, will you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  About a year...about a month before, obviously...uh...the adults were aware of what was going on and we children were becoming slowly aware of the gathering clouds. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And my father was a reserve...uh...uh...officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">He was a first lieutenant...I guess lieutenant in the Polish army, and in August...uh...the reserve company in that he was part of went on maneuvers. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I was ll and a half, and that was the last time I saw him until I saw him in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in January 1949. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">He never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">The war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">He was fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Uh...Of course, we didn't know what was going to happen and about the tenor of the pre- war Polish press was...uh...we will fight the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">We will not let them take over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So little did we know how powerful Nazis armies were. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And the war broke out and..uh...(sigh) within a few days, first waves of refugees started coming.,...</span><span class="sentence" id="65">telling hair raising stories about atrocities committed on the population by the Germany army, by the indiscriminate bombing, by the German air force of crowded <span class="DLF">roads</span> filled with refugees, with..with men, women, children, possessions, animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Uh...It was extremely scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">It... Many times I said to my friends who are questioning me about this period that my childhood ended on September 1, 39. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Uh...Within couple weeks, the threat of the advancing German armies were so great that all the able bodied men who otherwise were not in the armies started drifting east to escape the advancing German armies. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">To escape...to possibly join the Polish army somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And that's where...I forget the date, but obviously it's known to history...uh...suddenly as...as.. as we realized we were stabbed in the back by the Soviet armies marching into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> from the east and completely...uh.. destroying whatever little resistance there was to...to the advancing German forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Only then we learned about the Molitov/Ribbontrop (ph) pact, dividing <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and within a couple days after this event, the Germans marched into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boleslawiece</span> and...uh..for some reason I remember the...the day very vividly because that was the day that I had to an optometrist to pick up my first pair of glasses. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And they were little beady little things...uh..but I had to wear them and I walked out of the <span class="BUILDING">optometrist's shop</span> and the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> kind of looked crooked, but people were pointing out to...to the advancing...marching German. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Actually men...Germans didn't march. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">They were riding <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , and their green uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">People were reaching out to them, and the Germans were throwing cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">That was my first impression of the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Uh...Within time that I cannot determine and now in retrospect I know that it was pursuant to some agreement between the Russians and the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">The Germans withdrew and the Soviet troops moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">They were...uh...they were shabby looking, and they were...they were terribly looking...uh...neglected by our standards, un...unused to western facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Uh...Immediately in ...1n private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , Russian authorities quartered some officers or some other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">They had to be explained about <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet bowls</span> and things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">They didn't know what they were for.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  What about you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  I guess the overwhelming feeling was of fear for my father, fear for what's going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I had forgotten until a few days before our interview, as I started thinking about those years and those times, how terribly fear dominated our lives were. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">How easy it was to control whole populations by terror in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And I as a 12 year old kid was simply scared of what's going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">But as soon as the Soviets walked in, they ostenaciously opened the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And we were...the same teachers were permitted to continue to teach and we were allowed to return to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , encouraged to return to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">New subjects were introduced. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Ukrainian since this part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was...uh...a majority of population was Ukrainian. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And we were...back in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Now in retrospect I see how terribly...uh...disturbed I was by the events because my grades plummeted. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I was bring nothing but Ds and Cs from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I was an A student before. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Uh...Psychologists will tell you this is the first sign that something 1s wrong with a kid when he doesn't get good grades in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Uh...But obviously we were in..1n...in great fear for what's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">In the meantime, we received a post card from our father saying that he is interned in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yur</span> (ph) where Polish armies that after they could no longer fight the Germans and Soviets, they crossed to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and were interned there under rather benign conditions because Hungarians, even though the government was collaborating, with the Nazis, the...the population...Hungarians were friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">We were permitted by the authorities to send a wire to my father...1n German, and to this day I remember the text of the wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Gese1 Gesunt (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We are healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We are well. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">That's all we were permitted to say in that <span class="DLF">wire</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And...uh...that's all we heard from my father for...for a very, very long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Uh...In the meantime, the <span class="BUILDING">Russian school</span> continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">My mother was teaching....uh...sometimes some of our teachers had to be one lesson ahead of what they were teaching us. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">But we heard rumors that this is not going to last, this peace between the Germans and the Russians, although the Russians dismissed this propaganda and didn't...didn't allow it to...to...to be officially stated. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And...uh...1 may not recall anything from that period, except that I, of course, had many Jewish friends in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And uh, we were So involved in our own little world. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Uh... The boys were talking about sex serupticiously. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We were organizing poetry circles. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Uh...We were exchanging letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">We had school mail where we would write letters to each other and..uh.. And then (pause) in June of 41, Hitler attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And within a day or 2, Soviets withdrew from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , but first blowing up and devastating most of the important facilities in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , such as a <span class="BUILDING">power house</span> and a lot of other installations. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And the German, Nazis returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And that is really when the terror started in earnest. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">The rumors started circulated that the Nazis are going to declare a...a day of liberty quote unquote for the Ukrainian population to settle the score with the Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And to our horror one day came and suddenly there were pogroms everywhere with the Ukrainian peasants coming into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and beating and murdering Jewish families and...and...uh..and we, of course, stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> petrified and just didn't get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Uh...At that time, the economic situation also changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">We started feeling a dearth of food and supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We started getting hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Everything was disrupted. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">The...the normal functioning of the society was reduced to the minimum and everything was being...uh..collected, confiscated by the Nazi authorities to help their war machine drive into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="124">Sigh) I heard numerous stories of what happened to my colleagues. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Uh...I do not recall the details. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">It was too scary to even listen to, but I heard about my...one of my friends, Romack (ph), whose parents and...and sister were killed by the...and I'm not even sure by whom. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And then he pleaded with them, "Kill me too. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">You killed the rest of my family." </span><span class="sentence" id="129">That's the only detail that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">We were getting...uh...progressively more and more...uh..desperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">The only way to survive was to take our possessions, whatever we had and whatever a Ukrainian farmer wanted and trade it for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I remember through a friend we traded a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> that my father had for 20 kilograms of Swani (ph), the pork fat or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">People were trading <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , taking them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and getting some grain. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I remember a grinding, ordinary grain in a coffee grinder, mixing it with water and salting it a little bit and baking it on top of the..the gas burning <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> and that would be our food. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So it was really hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So then we decided that we have to get back to <span class="REGION">central Poland</span> where my mother's sisters lived and where it would be easier to survive and have help from the two...two sisters and their families.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  Before you move, you have talked about the pogroms in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Can you tell me, when you came out from your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , what was it like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  Pogroms in... in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boreslawiece</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boreslawiece</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  Yal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  Uh...What were the...what was it like? </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Did you have any Jewish friends at that time, any Jewish acquaintances. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Can you tell us? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">What happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I had many friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I had many friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I visited one friend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Uh...And....uh...1 came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I remember talking to his mother who was in tears and saying to me...uh...,Look, Panjawatko (ph), Mr. Witkowski (ph),in Polish you would Mr., but you would use the first name as sort of a half way familiar term between first name and using the last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">They just ran into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and ransacked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Look at this beautiful Trammel (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Trammel (ph) was a long, tall mirror that would have some sort of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pedestal</span> on the bottom, and a little shelf in front of it like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mantel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">They just came in and threw a stone in it and just shattered the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Fortunately, in this friend's family nobody was hurt or killed, but I have heard about numerous situations in which people were...were beaten up or killed by the...by the Ukrainian peasants.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  Please go on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Uh...Those days are pretty much in haze. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Uh...I have no other recollections of my days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boreslawiece</span> except progressive economic difficulties and fear what's going to happen to us and desire to get out of there and go back where the roots were, where the...my mother's family lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So on a crowded <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> at night, I traveled from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boreslawiece</span> back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> some...some time before Christmas, probably in 41. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Eventually, my mother and my sister joined us, joined me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> , and the rest of the war was spent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> , living first with one and...and then with another, having a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in their crowded <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">In those days, it was very lucky if you could have one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to one family. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And the following years until about 1944 was spent primarily Mother working in...uh...1n...uh...in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and then eventually working her way to a <span class="BUILDING">food store</span> that was next to the <span class="BUILDING">German controlled factory</span> where she...everybody had rations and everybody was allowed to get only so much bread, so much butter, so much other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I learned what ersatz (ph) coffee is. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I learned many other things that I had not learned before in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Uh...Among us youngsters, there were roughly my temporaries among the children of the two aunts, we organized secret teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">That is the older kids were teaching the younger kids to continue our education because the Germans, of course, closed all the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and prohibited in the entire <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> any normal education except the first few grades of <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Uh...The population of those <span class="REGION">areas</span> was destined only to be able to read and write so they would obey Germany orders in the future....uh..future world run by the German...by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">We knew that we had to move because in the part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where my aunt lived, the Nazis were organizing the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">We had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and move to another part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and that part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was fenced 1n and all the Jewish population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> were...was ordered to live in... in...uh...in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">They were guarded by some sort of a uniformed police. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">They were not allowed to leave the <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">They were required to wear either a Star of David or a arm band with a Star of David. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Uh...The next few years...uh...were characterized by increasing terror, increasing executions, deportations of all the leading citizens of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Not only Mayor and the...and the prominent citizens, doctors, lawyers, teachers,...uh...but even anybody who would be a member of what was called in these days intelligencia, you know, people with higher education were being systematically exterminated by the Nazis, taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">At the same time, there was a gradual growth of underground, of resistance, of organizing, not only the adults into groups that would be preparing for eventual struggle because that no one had any doubt that Nazi terror has to end one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Not only to prepare for armed struggle but in the meantime to collect information about troop movements, about the...uh...the activities of the Nazis,...uh..documenting their atrocities against the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Uh...Learning how to move around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , including us youngsters who were organized in units of clandestine scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Before the war, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> had a very active scouting movement and after the occupation many teenagers were organized into units to...to prepare for the eventual struggle against the Nazis, but in the meantime learning, reconnoitring...uh..moving from one part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ...uh...avoiding main <span class="DLF">arteries</span> , being able to cross...uh...through <span class="DLF">court yards</span> and jump over <span class="DLF">fences</span> and things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And...uh...eventually learning the Morse alphabet and things like this and eventually we were...a few of us were designated as a unit to provide...serve as...uh... curious when I talk about these times, I'm forgetting some of the English words. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I only remember Polish words. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Word, warshanetza, where the...uh...the people who were runners from one partisan unit to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Young boys were chosen for this purpose because they were not adults and they had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and they could avoid Germans in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">But 1f...1n those days, the partisan units had no way of communicating with each other, very few radios, so they were using youngsters to carry a message from one <span class="NPIP">end</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And a group of us, about a dozen or so, were sent into the partisan unit that was active in...in the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  How was that like for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER:  Uh, that was a most curious experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">We slept during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">We marched at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Each one of us had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">We had no arms, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">We were dressed in civilian clothing to look inconspicuous. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I learned how to walk and sleep at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Walking with a friend, locked in arms, and just marching in a column at night and sleeping at the same time, or leaning on your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and...uh...uh...somehow managing to...to sleep and walk at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">During the day we would lie low because the Germans, of course, controlled the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Uh... encountered some Jewish survivors of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> that were in the meantime being liquidated by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I did not know which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> they were from but I remember two of the men that were...uh...employed quote unquote by the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> ...uh...uh...unit of this regiment, that was called regiment. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Uh,...I don't know what they were doing, but they were...they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I remember seeing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">They looked terribly neglected, terribly impoverished, terribly...uh...they looked like...like driven animals because presumably of the experiences they went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I don't know what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">When most of the group was disband in the fall of 44, presumably they stayed with the group because we, in the summer of 44 were concentrating all of the underground forces to go to help the uprising in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> which broke out among this time, but, of course, that was a unsuccessful attempt because the..the crossings of major <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> were guarded and these partisan units did not have heavy armor or artillery or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So after about 3 or 4 months I returned <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to my mother and my sister, covered with lice, dirty, very, very...uh...skinny. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Had some infection in my fingers. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">The skin would simply balloon around the fingers and fill with some sort of pus or some sort of fluid. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">The nail would come off with the skin when the thing started healing. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I... couldn't sleep in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">For weeks, I would sleep on...on the runner on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> next to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I was just used to sleeping on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> uh...Just curling up and covering myself with the blanket when I was in..in the forests of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">But we remained in...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which was by that time totally terrorized by the...uh..by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">From early war...uh...from early days of occupation, the Nazis employed the...the infamous method of collective responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">One single act of hostility against the Nazis or destruction of German property or interference with the war effort would result in the roundup of 10, 20, 40 hostages. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">People who simply happened to live nearby where the event occurred, and they would be put against the nearest <span class="DLF">wall</span> and summary executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So the terror of those days and fear that drove us and concern for survival are something that...that only in the last days I brought back to..to my memory having tried to put it out of my mind all these years in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">The war ended for us...the occupation by the Nazis ended for us about January 9 or 10, 1945 seemingly significant date for me because my birthday is January 12th. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">The Nazis withdrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">The Soviet offense had started after Christmas of 44 and within days, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> were under Russian artillery fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">A very curious thing happened to me then. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I was...uh..living with my mother and my sister with one of my aunts who lived in a <span class="BUILDING">brick house</span> , much sturdier than surrounding frame houses on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">On the Yasna (ph) 27.

<p><span class="sentence" id="231">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Alright, we're back. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">January of 1945 and the Russians are...
ANSWER:  The Russian artillery is bombarding the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">We are hiding in...1n wherever we can against the <span class="DLF">brick walls</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that only has crawl...crawl space in part of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">There are fires everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Uh...My mother is not with us because a few days earlier she struck out for the cousins that lived in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and had a <span class="BUILDING">flour mill</span> to get some flour for us because, as always, we were short of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So she is somewhere, and my sister and I with the rest of my aunt's family are hiding there, plus a number of neighbors that came into hide in the <span class="BUILDING">brick house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Uh...The...the barrage stops. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">It's...uh...it's a beautiful, sunny, but very cold January day. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">The...the snow is crunching under your feet, but the sun is bright, blinding. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">We briefly...two men walk out in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I followed them and I stand between them. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And they are looking around and saying, "Oh, look there's a fire near Kinga (ph) <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Maybe it's the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And there's a fire over there." </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And I just stand between them, a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">You know 17 year old or...or whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And then suddenly I have this feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I do not hear a voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I sense a voice in me saying, "What are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Get out of here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="253">So I obeyed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I get scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I turn around, walk into the very heavy wooden <span class="DLF">oak gate</span> that is in the center of the very old fashioned, one-story <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , take about 3 or 4 steps and suddenly bells are ringing in my ears. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I smell sulphur...uh..plaster from...the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> falls on me and it's all over me. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I'm white. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And I cannot hear anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I hear ringing in my ears. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And people were rushing by me. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">My cousin, Andrew, and others are running out there and dragging in two bodies of the men that stood on both sides of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And...uh...one of them 1s...1s dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Totally mutilated legs dangle like rag dolls, and the other one just expires. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Uh... That shook me. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And when my mother returned...uh...a day or two later and my family told her what happened, she simply said, "You are not meant to die then. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">You are meant to go on until the time for you to die came," because these two men obviously were not meant to live any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">She...she has great faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">But, for us, the war ended that January. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Russian troops moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Some of the uh, Russian organized and controlled first army Polish troops moved in, recruit...recruited or drafted from eastern provinces of pre-war Poland, and trickling into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> started coming back first Jewish refugees who were with escaped or got somehow saved by going to the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Uh...Most of them, of course, were either in the military units or in the first administrative apparatus of the communist regime that came in and took over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And...uh...my memories 1s very dim whether <span class="BUILDING">school</span> started or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I don't think the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ... Yes, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> started. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> started within a month or two because I remember even before the war was officially declared over on May 9, 1945, our <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> was already functioning and we were going back and enrolling in classes and...and...uh...around that time, April or...or May, us youngsters who only lived this heroic, teenage involvement in..in...1n patriotism and fight against the Nazis started resurrecting our pre-War...uh..boy scout units in...1n <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> and I was one of the...uh...leaders of the...the troop I guess you would call it in English that was organized, being re...reorganized in <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And we were, by the summer...by early summer of 45, we were planning our first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> even though we had nothing, but the enthusiasm of the young boys were such that we were just ready to even live without <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> as long as we could get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and...and go somewhere and do our scouting thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So we were planning a week's excursion into the...the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> in <span class="REGION">Kielce region</span> ...uh..which were called Gory Swietokrzyskie, St. Cross, Holy Cross Mountains. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And my boys were...if you pardon me the expression, this is how I ever referred to them being their leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">You know, this just like in the old song...I'll take care of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I'm 17, you're 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">But I was their...one of their leaders, so my boys were already in uniforms and were getting ready to leave the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And I think it was in July, but I'm not sure of the dates again. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">When we heard rumors that the...uh...that there is something funny going on, some kind of emotion, riot or civil commotion 1n..uh...along <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shenetza</span> (ph) which 1s a little stream that ran through...through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> and...uh...but I went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And I started asking people what's going on...and people told me, "Oh, this is a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that 1s occupied by the Jews." </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And...uh and...uh... something funny is going on there because ...uh...a Polish, Christian Catholic boy was missing for a couple of days and...uh...and..uh...he was found and...uh.. he said that...that's where he was kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And of course one of the most pernicious...uh...stories about the Jews...uh.. for centuries in Europe was that they had to use Christian blood for religious rituals. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And so, of course, this population of this...of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , I'm not going psycho-analyze them, but here we are for the first time not really afraid of..of terror of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">This population restless, unhappy because communists are taking over and most of the people were anti- communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Uh...These...I...I'm trying to understand what happened, but I'm not going to try to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I'm going to try to tell you what I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And the only thing I saw was a large crowd of people surrounding this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and rumors flying back that the...that the military were entering upstairs where the <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> of the Jewish survivors were and the shots were fired and nobody knew who shoot...fired first, but there were casualties and there were arrests. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And I saw one or two of my boys in scouting uniforms in the crowd, gawking. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And I said, "What are you doing here in the scouting uniform? </span><span class="sentence" id="293">How can you even be showing around? </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Don't you have any sense of responsibility? </span><span class="sentence" id="295">This is a mob?" </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And I remember sending them <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Next day, I think we were leaving, out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , so the...so the...the events moved quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And only when we came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> we read the official accounts in the local papers that...uh...criminal elements have killed or wounded several Jewish residents of this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...uh...obviously for...for criminal purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">But then, 2 or 3 months later, and I'm not sure of the date, one of my boys in my troop and I only remember his first name, Genuard (ph), Gene or Eugene, came to me and said to me, Wallace, I have to tell a very strange story. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">My young brother...and I cannot remember the age, but I know it was a child barely 3, 4 or 5 maybe ...that would be a range age....disappeared from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for 4...3, 4, 5 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">We were desperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">We didn't know what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">We were searching everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">The child just wondered away. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And then the militiza (ph) came, the...the...the communist militia, the...the equivalent of our police and found him and brought him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">They never said where they found him, but...and this is my boy from my scout troop telling me...when they started questioning him where he was and he could not tell, they took him to that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> occupied by the Jewish refugees, survivors and said and asked him, "Is this where you were kept?" </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And the child said, "Yes." (</span><span class="sentence" id="308">Pause) I read in the papers later that there were trials and they were not only trials of perpetrators of the killings, but all...also trials or at least retribution by various factions in the communist government, within the communist authority that controlled the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And I am sure there are others who followed the events better and have more insight or more contact with the people who participated in these things, but they were some other...some people were trying to use this event for...for other purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Maybe some international party...uh..politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">But what was curious to me is the fact that I remember what my scout told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Distinctly that it was the militzia (ph) that came and planted in a child's mind...the kid was probably scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Undoubtedly the militzia (ph) just questioning him, "Were you...that's...Is that where you were kept?" </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And the child said, "Yes."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">QUESTION:  How did you react when you heard your scout tell you this story?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">ANSWER:  (Sigh)
QUESTION:  You're 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">ANSWER:  I was 17. (</span><span class="sentence" id="318">Pause) To...to be honest, I didn't know what to do with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I felt that there was some skullduggery going on in the way the child was being manipulated. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Uh...But my main concern at that time was for the safety of my boys and that they do not in any way...uh...get in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">That's what motivated me to shoo them away from the...the crowd that surrounded the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And I sensed the tragedy. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">But to a 17 year old, you cannot expect too much and I'm sorry to say that looking at myself from the vantage point of being 62...uh...even if we wanted to have done something with it, who were we to turn to? </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Perhaps that is why I am telling it to you today. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Because that may just help unravel the roots of those events. (</span><span class="sentence" id="326">Long Pause)
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">You should go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">What was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> like after these events. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Were there a change at all in the atmosphere?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">ANSWER:  There was a tremendous reaction from the emerging....uh... civic organizations and church authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Uh...uh...Appeal to citizens to...to point out the guilty parties who participated in these events. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And I don't even know how long the...the pogroms lasted, whether it was a day, whether it was 2 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I have no recollection. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I remember Bishop Katchmarick (ph) issuing a very strong appeal to people to uphold the law to protect the innocent, to...to report on...uh... commission of crimes to the authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> to begin was...with was devastated by the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">There were ruins everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">There were <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that were lying in ruins. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">There wasn't a family that was not mourning a death of a son or a father or a brother that was either killed or executed or deported to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Uh...Every family practically was under such enormous, physical and...uh..uh...hardship and...uh...emotional pressure that we were literally survivors in every sense of the word. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">All of us! </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And it was awfully tragic that victims started turning on...on other victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And...uh...for some reason...uh...which I don't understand at all, 1t happened in my native <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .

(</span><span class="sentence" id="374">Pause) It was good to see my father's handwriting. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And he started sending packages and...uh...saying that he is in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , that he survived the September 39 campaign and was interned in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , escaped from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ; joined the Polish armed forces...uh...in time for the German attack on <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ; fought the Germans there; was capture; escaped German...uh...uh...captivity; walked at night through <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> until he got to <span class="REGION">southern France</span> ; crossed over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and to the <span class="DLF">Gibraltar</span> ; shipped from the Gibraltar to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ; trained in military units in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ; never gave up the fight; and was sent with the military mission to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Windsor</span> , <span class="REGION">Ontario</span> , just south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> to recruit volunteers for the Polish armed forces to continue the fight with the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">That was, of course, before U.S. was attacked in Pearl Harbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">So there was volunteers signing up from the Polish-American communities, both in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And...uh...uh...in the meantime, he met friends...made friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> and when the mission was disband after Pearl Harbor, he got an offer of a job in the war industry in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> and was permitted to migrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Started immediate efforts to try to find out what happened to his wife and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And finally by early 45, succeeded, found us, uh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">QUESTION:  At this point, we need to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">We're going...it's a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stop.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">QUESTION:  We're going to stop and change tapes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">End of Tape #1 Tape #2 0200:39
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Can you tell us how you left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="388">ANSWER:  My father, of course, immediately started efforts to bring us over to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Unfortunately, the communist authorities, while giving permission to my mother to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> officially, denied permission to children. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Uh...We reasoned that this was because in those heady days with the communism they thought they could indoctrinate the young generation and...and use them and didn't want to lose them. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">A decision was then made that I would escape from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and if the <span class="DLF">road</span> ...route was successful, my sister would follow. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">So...uh...1n the meantime I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and made a successful escape from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> in the bottom of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coal freighter</span> on December 31, 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And I was to be followed by my sister in a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I made it to a lovely, colorful, untouched by war, just fabulously looking <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goteborg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And from there I managed to...uh...to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> within 3 days of my 21st birthday when my non-quota visa, immigrant visa was expiring. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">So I was lucky again. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And, I met...I flew from New York LaGuardia Airport to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> <span class="BUILDING">Old Willowrun airport</span> and looked up my father in the telephone directory and it's a very funny feeling to find your father's name in a strange directory in a strange <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And...uh...called his number. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">There was no answer and I stood at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">counter</span> not knowing what to do and I heard my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">He recognized me from the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And I was a big strapping 6 footer at the age of 21. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Uh...My mother came in May of that year, 85 officially. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">But my sister trying the same route...uh...did not make it, was caught by the communists and imprisoned and eventually came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in 1958 when the conditions in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> under Gemolka (ph) underwent a famous fall so they would permit families to reunite. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Decided to study law. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Graduated in 56, and started a law practice with then my father-in- law in Polish-American community on the west side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">In 62, I was contacted by a Congressman of Polish descent, John Dingle, and asked if I know of any identifiable Polish-Americans who would like to work on a foreign claimants settlement commission in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to assist in administering a program of adjudication of claims for properties lost in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And after looking around I decided that I'm the one (laughing) for other reasons as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">So I accepted an appointment as a staff attorney on a foreign claims settlement commission and worked on a Polish claims program for about 3 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Within 6 months....no, I came in August of 62. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">By Spring of 63, I was being sent to our <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> to help run our <span class="BUILDING">field office</span> to gather documentation to support claims of the American nationals for properties. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">A lot of those claims were by the American relatives or...uh...survivors of the Jewish population of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ...uh...who were claiming properties that were confiscated or destroyed during the war or after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And for 3 months in 1963, I traveled through <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> collecting documents...uh...seeking evidence because our function was not simply to sit as a tribunal and tell claims...show me, prove to me, but we were actively assisting them in this effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And at that time I came in contact with a...a...personnel of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Historical Institute</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and obtained from them a number of valuable documents and...and publications, some of which I have turned over to you for the...uh...<span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And it 1s that period of time that kind of gave me a broader perspective on the enormity of what happened between 1939 and 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Only then when traveling to little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , I was able to see the devastation, the...the tremendous...the tremendous losses that were inflicted on the population, especially the Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">pause
QUESTION:  Do you hear personal testimony as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Testimony was, in most cases, limited to description of property, possessions, but in many situations the survivors of those years...uh...who came to the <span class="BUILDING">commission offices</span> here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> testified as to their...uh..experiences during the Nazi's occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And I'm sure the records of the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, the so-called Polish Program have that testimony and they're probably in the <span class="BUILDING">U.S. Archives</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">QUESTION:  How did you...you first. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">How did you handle all of this? </span><span class="sentence" id="423">How did you feel when you...your seeing these people and dealing with these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">ANSWER:  First, I wanted to do a good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">First, I wanted justice done. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I did want to make sure that if there is any doubt, that doubt should be resolved in favor of the survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">There were other families. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">We were, after all, involved in a rather futile attempt to at least compensate materially for the...the enormity of evil that happened to these families, both Jewish and Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Unfortunately, under American law, we had the obstacles, such as citizenship at the time of loss. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And many, many people did not meet the requirement of U.S. citizenship by the time of loss occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">We could not grant compensation award reparations to peoples who were not American nationals or citizens at the time the loss occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I remember distinctly one decision which I, myself, was very pleased about...uh...because we applied a legal principal that permitted granting reparations to a much greater number of people rather than if we simply applied the official date of confiscation of the...of the property...uh...by the communists regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">We used the concept of loss of use and enjoyment. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Very often, communists in their profidious manipulation of the records and...and the law would leave the title and people, but would so restrict the rights of the owners or the ...uh...benefits that owners would derive from ownership of the property that for all intents and purposes, these people had all the burdens without any benefits. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">A rental property for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">So we then developed the concept that it was the loss of use and enjoyment of the property rather than the passage of title to the state that determined when people lost their possessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And that's how we were able to...to award compensation to people who otherwise would not have gotten it. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">On a deeper level (Pause) ....Dr. Kuzmack, it's very hard to think of those times without projecting on those times, what I feel today. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">We all evolve and we all become much more sensitized and much more aware of...uh...the measure of tragedy than at the time that we are involved in the mechanics or addressing this or that narrow issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I cannot really tell how I felt about it because honestly the same goes for my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Today, I think I'm a much more aware person. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I'm much more in touch with my emotions than at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">That's an honest answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">QUESTION:  Is there anything you would like to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">ANSWER:  I felt a regret at times and I have tried to put it to rest because it was a naive regret that had I been older maybe I would have been able to do more when I saw inhumanity and evil of those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">At the same time, I'm...I'm honest enough to admit that it's a...it's a hope tinged with fear because I wonder how many of us would have lived up the ideal of really disregarding our own safety and our own obligation to our loved ones to help a fellow man. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">How many of us would really live up to this principle when tested? </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I think there is a awareness in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> today which I sense from letters from relatives and friends and visits from friends and relatives...uh...what...what a great loss <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> suffered because of the extermination of its Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">As a child, as a youngster, I read...uh..some of the greatest poets and writers of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> who were Jews, Julian Tooly (ph) and...and so many others. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Uh...<span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is impoverished. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">To what extent it could have been prevented or its...1ts enormity limited, who's to judge? </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I just hope that in my own generation and in my own family and in my own children...uh...not only I hope but I make sure that there is awareness of the fact that we're all brothers and sisters, that we're all...to the extent that we discriminate or deprive of rights another human being, we do it to ourselves.</span></p>
