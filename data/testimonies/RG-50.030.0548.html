<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  What were their names [indecipherable]

QUESTION:  Did you have a — brothers and sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  My mother had — my parents married in 1929, and two years later my mother had a child, a — a daughter, called Judith, who had some sort of a disease that they couldn’t treat at the time, at the — when she ate, sh-she vomited or she had diarrhea, and they couldn’t stop it, and eventually, at age two, she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So I never knew — [coughing] — sorry.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  — another sibling. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">But sh — they did have another child. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And then, I’m the only child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  Well, tell me a little bit — I mean, if you were born in 1942, as it says here on our — our questionnaire, tell me a little bit about the circumstances you heard of when the war erupted. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">What happened with your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  Okay, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  What happened before your birth? </span><span class="sentence" id="26">November 9, 2008
ANSWER:  Okay, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">My mother, it’s very ironic that she and I are the only ones that survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">When “Mein Kampf” was written, my mother was very smart, and she says, this guy is not fooling around. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">He’s really gonna kill us all. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">We better get the hell out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And a lot of Dutch Jews had the misconception that <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> would stay neutral. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And why was that? </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Because during World War I, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> stayed neutral. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And they figured — so they said, well, even if, you know, the war breaks out, we’ll just stay neutral in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and we have nothing to worry about. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And my mother was very smart and she says, we may want to stay neutral, but Hitler won’t let us. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And she made everybody crazy, said, let’s get out, we have to get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">If we — th — it’s not good, we must leave Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">She was obsessed with leaving Europe and going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And nobody wanted to listen to her, because in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , like I said, they — they all thought nothing was gonna happen there. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And there were other people like my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">My — as a matter of fact, after I got married, my father-in-law — my — my husband’s grandfather was the same thing, he also saw it come. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And it got to the point that people didn’t invite him any more, because they didn’t want to hear this doomsaying, and 1 — this — they didn’t want to get depressed, and they said he’s crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And that’s how a lot of people felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">My whole family could have been saved, because my mother had a brother whose wife November 9, 2008 had a sister in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , married to a famous hazan there, and she would have —
QUESTION:  Can you tell me what that is, hazan?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  A cantor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  A cousin? </span><span class="sentence" id="47">A cantor.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  And she would have happily you — you know, let everybody come. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">But they just didn’t see it, they just thought that everybody that said, let’s get out, let’s get out, let’s go crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So finally my mother said, okay, if nobody will listen to me, [Il try to get papers on my own, and I’Il leave on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And she went, as she told me, she went already to the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> and started to get things going a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">But of course, then the war broke out and she got stuck like everybody else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  And the war broke out when?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  The war broke out May — I believe it was May 10 — in May, was May 10" or May 15". </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Broke out in May 1940, in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">November 9, 2008
ANSWER:  And she got stuck. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So then I was born, and even already before I was born, in beginning of 1942, things started to get — the very first year or so, things weren’t so bad yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Can I ask a few questions about that?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">But your parents still lived in their own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>

ANSWER:  They had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and they lived in their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And then what they did is, the men were called up to so-called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> , and the Dutch are very gullible, and they said, well maybe if we do as we’re told, it won’t so bad if we — you know, don’t try to get away with something. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And my mother again was smart, and she says — my father was — I was born in March 4, 1942, and they started to call up the men, and my father’s call-up came and my mother said, let’s go into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Being that my father was dealing in animal hides, he knew every farmer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , November 9, 2008 and he was apparently a very nice man. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And somebody would have gladly put him up. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">No, no, no, I’ll go, Pll go. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And —

<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  And you never knew him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  Of course not, of course — I was four months old. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So then what happened, she went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And one night, not long after my father had left, maybe a couple of days later, whatever, the Nazis came, you know, they came and did house searches to take people out. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And she went upstairs to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and she put the covers under her head. [</span><span class="sentence" id="90">tape break]
QUESTION:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Okay, sh — covers were over her head.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  So, the covers were over her head, and it’s like a miracle, I was a four month old baby, most of the time babies cry, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I don’t know, instincts, I didn't cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And it was dark, and my mother describes they — they had flashlights and they went over the — with the flashlight and said — and then one said to his partner, said, ah, there’s November 9, 2008 nothing here, let’s get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">At that point my mother said, this is getting a little bit too hot, we better go into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So my mother had an address. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Her sister worked in a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  Did your mother, by the way, was she a homemaker, or wi — did she also have a job someplace?</span></p>

QUESTION:  Homemaker.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  — [indecipherable] homemaker, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And her sister worked in this <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And one of her customers said to her once, if you ever need a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide, or any of your family, this is our address. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And sh-she gave her the [indecipherable] to my mother, so my mother had that address. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And after this little incident, she went over there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  By this point, was the rest of the family still not believing the danger that was going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I mean, I — I take it that what you are telling me now is a retelling as your mother explained it to you, what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Of course, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">November 9, 2008
QUESTION:  And — and while one could be incredulous and not believe it when “Mein Kampf” comes out in 1920 —
ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  — in the 1920s, by the time you’re rolling around and it’s 1940 and people are being taken away and there’s searches, then that could change a few minds. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">What was that like? </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I mean, did she ever talk about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  By — by then you couldn’t get out, unless you had li — you had a lot of money and a lot of connections. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">By the time people realized, yeah, that maybe she was right, you tried to get out, 1t was almost impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">You had to, as I said, lots of money and lots of connections, and lots of luck.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  My in-laws got out, I can tell you about that later, that’s nothing to do with me particularly, but they did get out in 1940, four months after the invasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">But by the time the people realized, 1t was too late, it real — really was too late.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  There was nothing you could do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Okay, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So let’s go back, she has this address —
ANSWER:  So, she has this address, and she goes to this family, and they let her in, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> was the more Protestant family. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">The sou-southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was November 9, 2008 more Catholic, bordering <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">The northern part in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> was more Protestant, but there were also Catholic families, they just tended to have bigger families, I guess they didn’t believe in birth control or whatever, they just tended to have bigger families. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And that particular family also they had a bunch of daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">There was about six kid — five, six kids in the family, seven, whatever, I don’t know exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And so my mother was 35 at that point, and they had a bunch of daughters all in their 30s, so my mother could blend in. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">My mother also did not look Jewish at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">My mother could easily have blended in. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Some of the Catholics looked more Jewish than she did, so — she was a little woman, she was slight, and she did no — my friend here to see — no, Mama, no, didn’t look Jewish at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So, she blended in. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So they let her in, and while she was there, not very long, they said look, Annie, they’re — she went by the name Annie — they said Annie, you know, we — we want you to stay and you’re welcome to stay with us, but you have to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for the child, because our neighbors know that none of my daughters were pregnant, and when all of a sudden a baby cries, and a baby appeared, they know that something 1s up, and the baby will give us all away. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And my mother realized, of course, they were right, and she certainly didn’t want to jeopardize their life and her life and my life, so she set about finding a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And she really didn’t have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">But apparently, from what she told me, there was an org — an underground organization November 9, 2008 consisting of doctors, nurses and medical students. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And if you needed a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for a child, you could go there, and they would place the child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  But she didn't know them personally? </span><span class="sentence" id="141">She didn’t know the [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  No, no, no, she just went to that organi — it was an underground organization, like, you know, like anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So, my mother went there and she said, I have a four months old that needs to be placed, do you have a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> for her? </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And they said, okay, on such and such a day, a couple will appear, and they will take your child away; they will take your child into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And they tried to match up the couples with the ages. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Like, if there was a teenager, they wouldn’t give it a couple in their early 20s, that would look out of <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you didn’t want to walk — so, like I was four months old, so they gave me to a couple in their 20s. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And my mother did, and —
QUESTION:  Must have been a tough day for her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  And, as she describes, she packed my things, and she put a few special things in there, like a — what do you call that thing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  A rattle?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  A rattle. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">A special rattle and some other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And I had a little birthmark on my thigh, I think, but I don’t have it any more, but I had that. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And she figured if when the war is over, and she didn’t — nobody knew when it would be over, and a four months old, after a year you don’t recognize your own child, she would ask for November 9, 2008 the things, at least she would be able to identify her own child. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Which, by the way, is exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And —
QUESTION:  Smart lady.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  —I can just imagine my poor mother, two strangers come to the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and she handed me to two strangers, not knowing if she would ever see me again. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">In the beginning of the war from ol — this is all what she told me, they would tell the parents where they took the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">The Nazis soon found out about that, and they would get the parents and torture them long enough that it would give away the address of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">By the time I was hidden, my mother wasn’t told anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">They wouldn’t tell me wha — what ci-ci — what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> I went to, who I went to, where, she knew nothing, just handed me, and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I was extraordinarily fortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Because I came to a childless couple who were absolutely fantastic to me, who loved me dearly, who did everything and anything in their power to make things bearable...
QUESTION:  We were talking about your foster parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  And — and your luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">November 9, 2008
ANSWER:  As I said, they were very — they were a childless couple, extraordinarily nice to me, and what was my luck? </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Number one that they were childless. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">In a way that was very lucky because they put all their love and — you know, devotion to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  Yes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  And for some reason, I stayed with them the whole war. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">They — I guess we clicked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  So your earliest real memories would be of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">So, but — well, why I say I was lucky, because I have many friends that were 1n hiding, and they were bounced from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And that was a terrible th-thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Every time you were attached to something, you know, they — they had to leave again, for a variety of reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">That’s why I consider myself lucky that they were good people. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">They treated me like their own. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Their extended family were very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">My foster mother had a brother, a-and a s — a sister and mother-in-law that lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and their children, they were good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Her parents lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">They were all very good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And ber — being a very good [indecipherable] I mean, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> — I was wa — hidden in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utrecht</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  Oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">November 9, 2008
ANSWER:  And I was hidden in an <span class="REGION">area</span> called rivier er buurt, which means the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> — the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">river neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Because a lot of the <span class="DLF">streets</span> were named after <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And apparently there were a lot of Jewish children hidden in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">So — and the underground knew about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So, when they staged a raids, most of the time, the underground had enough time to ring the doorbell and said, get the kids out of here, a raid is coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And guess where they took me? </span><span class="sentence" id="191">To her parents, to her sister and brother-in-law and their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So not only did they —

<p><span class="sentence" id="372">ANSWER:  No, no, because I think they were all trying to pull their own weight. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">My mother, yes she had lost her whole family, which by the way, she didn't know yet at that point, because people didn’t know until a few years after if people had survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">It wasn’t the computer age, and the Red Cross gave you the information. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And people went for years after to look at lists at the Red Cross to see if anybody had survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">So my mother was not aware that everybody had been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">She didn’t know yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">But I can imagine, after her own source, and her own — you know, it wasn’t easy for her to be in hiding either, and then you find your child and your November 9, 2008 child is a stranger to you and the child doesn’t want you, and my mother didn't even know right away that it was right, and she asked to see that rattle, and if you remember in the beginning I told you she packed some things. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">She asked to see if they had the suitcase that she packed for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And sure enough they produced it, and she looked to see if I had the birthmark on my thigh and there it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">I don’t have it any more, but it was, I guess, a sign from God to show me who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And I can imagine how terrible for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I mean, she would — the children that were older, that were reunited with their parent, they run to their parent, Mommy, Mommy. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I didn’t run to my mother, I didn’t want to go to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">On the other hand I also understand my foster parents, who knew when they took me, it wasn’t an adoption. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">It was — I was given there for safekeeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">They knew that they weren’t supposed to keep me. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">But I can also understand, I have children and a grandchild myself, you get attached to a child, especially when you shelter a child against such horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">You don’t want to give the — I understand their point too, as an adult. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">As a child, I didn’t, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">So I remember it was very tense between my foster parents, especially my foster father and my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">It wasn’t an easy relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And my mother would have liked nothing better than I would have said to her, oh, I don’t want nothing to do with these people, I only want to be with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And I didn’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I loved these people dearly, and I’ve loved them til the end of their days, November 9, 2008 and I had them come here to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and they met my husband and my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And, you know, I did whatever I could to them.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="399">ANSWER:  —I mean, it is so unfair, I mean, I can understand it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">It wouldn’t have been as bad for my foster parents, even though they were very attached to me, of course, to give me up, had they had their own children. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I guess that made also a bit of a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">But they didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And many years after the war they told me, no matter how bad the war was, having me were the best years of their life.</span></p>
