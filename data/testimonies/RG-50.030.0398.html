<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Good morning, Amy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Good morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Nice to have you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Can you please tell us your full name? </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Your name at birth, and your name now, and when you were born, and where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  I was born Amy Zahl, that’s Z-a-h-l, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I was born in 1919 on Holy Innocence Day, December the 28".</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  What is Holy Innocence Day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  December the 28".</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  Does it mean something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  In the <span class="BUILDING">Christian church</span> it does.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Can you tell us what it means?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  No, I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Oh, you don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Can you tell us a bit about your childhood and your parents and your siblings if you have any?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I was born into a family of two sisters and four brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Two of the brothers and one sister were half-brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">They were children of a first husband of my mother’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">My parents were originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , as was my mother’s first husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">In fact, I still possess her Ketuba from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , and her permit to travel in the pale (ph) of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and she came as immigrant as many people did at the time of the turn of the century when everybody seemed to be leaving for the United States, and she was one of those immigrants that got stuck in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and she was one of those immigrants that got stuck in Britain. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">As you probably know, almost all of them — particularly the Jews — intended to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> where the <span class="DLF">streets</span> were supposed to be lined with gold, but my mother got left behind, and eventually met my father who married her, and I grew up in this large family as the youngest child, and it was rather nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  What was your mother’s name and your dad’s name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  My mother’s name was Kravitz, which 1s, I think, is a common name. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">She was married — her first marriage was to a cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">She was an orphan, according to what she told me — I’m sure she spoke the truth — and was married to a cousin, and the grandfather — her grandfather who brought her up — felt 1t was important for her, also, to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I think she loved <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and would’ve liked to have stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">You know, this story that people tell of pogroms are not always true. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">A lot of them left for economic reasons, just as everybody else left Europe for economic reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  And your dad?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  My father came from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , I think from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , he told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Some of his family went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harbin</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> , and eventually ended up in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and they live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">One of their sons has gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">My mother’s relatives came to — I don’t know if it’s the midwest — they came to <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> , and I know that as a child, they used to write me and send me dollars for candy, but I never met them, and I think, as happened in other families, correspondence was sparse and eventually contact was lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  And What was your father’s name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  My father was Nathan Zahl, Z-a-h-l. He had relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> who were on the stage, and they were in <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , and they were nice family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  So, what was it like growing up in this family with all these children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Well, they weren’t children to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">They were all adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I was a child growing up in a family of adults, and since ostensibly I was a weak child, I was always being sent away to recuperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So, I didn’t grow up close to this family, close emotionally to this family. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I did to my eldest sister, who is really a half-sister, but I was very much, I think, a lone child because everybody else was older than I. The next one in the family was five years older than I.</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And are there any particular characteristics of this family? </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Were you religious in the family? </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Not religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  We were not religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">My father was, I would say, a-religious. [</span><span class="sentence" id="48">Technical difficulty; asked to start over preceding part]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Oh, I’m sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">From where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  Well, tell me about your family and in terms of are you a religious family? </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Were you not a religious family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  We were not a religious family in the sense we didn’t attend <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">My father did take me to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on all the holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">He explained to me what was going on, but he was not a religious man. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">The nice thing I remember about being Jewish, I suppose, was the wonderful Friday evenings when we all gathered together, and on the holidays when friends would also come, and for the Passover when they would invite people who didn’t have family. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">My mother was a very generous, warm, and kind person, and she was always inviting people into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">She was very forward-looking, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I hope, that I have some of her characteristics.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  What kind of political consciousness was there? </span><span class="sentence" id="60">You grew up at a time when there was a lot of upheaval in <span class="REGION">western Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Were you very conscious of it as you grew up in the late ’20s, in the early ’30s in terms of what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  In the late ‘20s, I would say no. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">In <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , we had, as you had, a tremendous depression, economic depression. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">There was a lot of employment even — not even, but in my family, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I began to be aware that things were happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when I was 14 or 15, a settlement house, of which I was member, began to have youngsters from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> <span class="BUILDING">settlement house</span> , of which I was member, began to have youngsters from Germany come to learn English, to help pass the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">They were builted (ph) locally, and I got to know some of them and felt awful that they had been sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> , let’s say in °35-’36, without their parents — to a <span class="REGION">foreign country</span> where most of them had no relatives, and I felt very deeply about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I think this is what affected me when eventually the British asked for volunteers to go overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I felt 1t was important that I must go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Could you please explain what a <span class="BUILDING">settlement house</span> is?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  A <span class="BUILDING">settlement house</span> — we had them also in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> — A <span class="BUILDING">settlement house</span> is a community center run usually by a voluntary agency, where youngsters and older people come. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">They have classes, educational classes, classes for mothers, in the old days, I suppose, they had classes teaching people English. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">It’s a real <span class="BUILDING">community center</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  So, tell me what these kids told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I mean, I know you were conscious that they were orphans — not orphans, but they were without their parents, without their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Did they tell you about what had happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  No, they didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">They just — they didn’t talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">One didn’t ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Firstly, being British, you’re rather reticent, anyway, but one had a sense that these kids were alone, terribly alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">There was no family. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">There were no cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Occasionally, one would have an aunt in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and that would be rather nice because she had family to relate to, but in the 30s, many German parents — rather, not many, but a number of German parents who could afford it were sending their children to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> because German law prohibited them from attending <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Very early on in, I think, 1933, the first law came in which limited the number of Jewish children who could attend <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And so, a number of them came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and they were taken in by families. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">There was an organization called B’nai B’rith, which still exists, and they helped a lot of these children, particularly the Orthodox Jewish children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  So, at what point do you think — was it after the war, or in 1939 that you became very conscious of what was happening? </span><span class="sentence" id="87">What drew you in 1943 to join the relief effort?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Well, firstly the war came in ’39. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I remember we had the bombing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and 90 days of bombing constantly is not very pleasant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  What was that like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  That was pretty awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Very often, I would be scared and I’d sit under a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , or I would like people to think that I was brave and so I took tea to the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> wearing my tin hat until I was going out one day with a young friend, and a piece of shrapnel went through his tin hat, and he was no longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">It was frightening and yet, you didn’t like to appear a coward. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">We did things that we would never do. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">We went into the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and put out incendiary bombs because, since the government, I suppose, wanted to know how many incendiaries had been dropped, they would pay us a half a crown which was about half a dollar in those days, to bring in the ends of incendiary bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So, we’d go out and we’d pick these things up once the bomb had gone off. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And, yet, we used to sit on the <span class="DLF">doorstep</span> occasionally in an air raid, and say, “What will we tell our children of the war?” </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And, you know, we were eating peanuts and we’d say, “Well, we’ll tell them that we sat on the <span class="DLF">doorstep</span> eating peanuts.” </span><span class="sentence" id="99">But, it was an interesting period because we never saw a fruit. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">If anybody brought in an orange, if an American soldier gave somebody an orange or a banana, we raffled it to the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We didn’t go hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We were never short of the most awful bread you can ever imagine, and the American powdered egg, which we even thought made good cakes, you know, we had forgotten what a good cake tasted like. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But, as I say, we were never hungry, and interestingly, we always knew we were going to win the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Don’t ask me why, perhaps this was a moral booster, perhaps this was Churchill’s speeches, but we never thought the Germans would overrun us. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Of course, we always suspected that we would be invaded, and this influenced, of course, the British attitude toward the refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">We suspected everybody with a German accent of being a spy. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">It was a very difficult period for them, much more so than for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  So, then, 90 days of bombing straight?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Ninety days of bombing on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  Was your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ever hit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  It was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  Yeah, but my mother was okay, you know, the heck with the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  So, where did you go? </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Did you stay in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  I met recently a woman, she called me as a result of my book. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">She called me and she said, “Do you remember, after the air raids when you’d done all your rounds, you used to come into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and sleep on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mat</span> or anywhere?” </span><span class="sentence" id="118">No, I went to stay with friends, and after the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was hit, we got my mother to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and go into the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I wouldn’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I felt safest in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , believe it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I couldn’t bear the thought of being outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and seeing the bombs falling, because you could see the fires.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  And your mother was okay with your staying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  My mother was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">We were all okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">It’s very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">There was no counseling 1n those days, and I sometimes wonder if we have too much counseling when a child goes through a small trauma, true, a trauma, but in the old days going through this bombing, nobody came and counseled us and very often we were helping to dig bodies out of the <span class="BUILDING">Anderson shelters</span> and finding people who were wounded badly, but we carried on. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">You know, this was life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  So, you were then how old, 13?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  I was — no, I was older in 1939, I was 18, and in 1940, I was 19, but we had no prior experience of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">The most wonderful thing to happen to us was when Hitler invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> because then the bombing began to let up. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And it was extraordinary because we all felt so guilty that here the Russians were taking what we had been having, and in those days, <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> was our friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">The Cold War that came later seemed so — so different, so difficult a period when we think of, we knew what the Russians were going through, that millions were being killed by the Germans, millions and millions of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I don’t think people even today realize how many millions of people were killed during that war outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I mean, we talk of six million Jews dying, and that number, you can’t imagine what six million is, and it was dreadful. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">There isn’t a Jewish family, I think, worldwide, which didn’t lose a relative, but in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , about 25 million people died.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  After 1941, when <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> was attacked, did you learn what was going on in terms of the killing of Jews and did you know what had gone on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the ’30s, rounding up political opponents and Jehovah’s Witnesses? </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Was there much knowledge that you had at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  If we read The Press and The Times published a lot of material. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">We knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I’m not saying I was very well-versed in what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I knew Jews were being killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I knew they were being put in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> because sometimes a friend would have a cousin who was 15, who’d been brought out whose head was shaven, and he’d been incarcerated in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We knew that people were being killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We knew that the Nazis were very nasty people, but when the killing really started, when the Final Solution started in 1942, I don’t think we, as individuals, I don’t remember, but I don’t think I knew this. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">We didn’t trust the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">We knew they’d kill every Jew they could get their fingers on. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So, from that point of view, we knew we had to be very careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">For example, if you would walk along the country lane in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , or even an ordinary <span class="DLF">street</span> <span class="DLF">country lane</span> in England, or even an ordinary street, and ask somebody directions, they’d never tell you in case you were a spy. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">The sign posts were taken down. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So, unless you knew the <span class="REGION">area</span> in which you were visiting, there was nothing you could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">We were terribly afraid of being invaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Ostens- you know, not ostensibly, obviously because we were 21 miles from the French coast, not very far, and not too far across the North Sea to get to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> <span class="DLF">French coast</span> <span class="REGION">French coast</span> , not very far, and not too far across the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> to get to England, and attempts were made to bring spies in. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So, it was a very difficult period because, if you met somebody you didn’t know, you didn’t discuss anything that might in some way give them information.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  Did you feel it was important when the Americans joined in the war effort? </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Was that a good sign for you, or did you actually feel before then, “We’ll win anyway.’”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  I think before the Americans came, we thought we’d win, but when the Americans came, Hallelujah! </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Now, it was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">It was wonderful because now we had an ally. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Can you imagine, in 1940, we were alone, totally alone, and many of us were making plans to try to escape somewhere because we knew that, as Jews, we, too, would be taken by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">But when the Americans, with the vast machinery for production, came into the war, somehow we really knew we might win.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  Did you also make plans to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  Oh, yes — made plans, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Where could we go to? </span><span class="sentence" id="164">But, we dreamed of going up maybe to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , finding our way up there, but what would do with our parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We’re a group of kids talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">You don’t leave parents behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">But we thought we might find roots. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">We daydreamed. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">We daydreamed, but we really knew that if the Germans came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , our lot was sealed. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">It was quite frightening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  So, what did you do after 1941? </span><span class="sentence" id="172">What happened between 1941 and ’43, before you joined? </span><span class="sentence" id="173">What sort of a <span class="DLF">track</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Had you gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Had you finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Yes, I was taking a course in social administration, and when I finished that course, I went up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birmingham</span> during the course, actually to work at a settlement house in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birmingham</span> , and then I went up to one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nottingham</span> where conditions were very different from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> <span class="BUILDING">settlement house</span> in Birmingham, and then I went up to one in Nottingham where conditions were very different from London. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And it was there that I heard that the British government, being the British government that it is, 1t always works closely with voluntary agencies, was asking for volunteers who would go overseas to any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to which they were sent with no prejudice, to help to save survivors both Jews and non-Jews, and I thought that was a marvelous idea, but I was terrified of getting on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> because <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> could be sunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">You know, we were losing so many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> during that war, but many people older than I were volunteering, and, what the heck? </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I must say, at that time I talked to my mother because I was her baby, and I told her what was happening and that it would be wonderful if we would find Jews who survived because even in the ’30s, as young as I was, I had some daydream that I could go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and rescue Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">At least help them to get their jewelry out so they could have some money when they came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">My mother said, “They would never let you out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Or, “They’d never let you in. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">You’re Jewish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I said, “But, Mother, they would never know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Of course, nobody would take me at age 16, but when this call came, I did volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">There were some people I respected who had volunteered, and the nice thing was I was chosen to go originally to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Casablanca</span> with a man called Friedman I think his name was. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">He was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">An American went as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">We were going to take care of Jews in a camp, but the French at that time were having trouble in <span class="COUNTRY">Lebanon</span> , so I learned, and so the British wouldn’t allow any women out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but the French at that time were having trouble in Lebanon, so I learned, and so the British wouldn’t allow any women out of the country. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So, Morris Friedman went for <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> , and I waited for the next unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">He went alone, and the next unit — each unit was ten persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">The first British-Jewish unit was seven Jews and three Quakers, and there were units of the Red Cross, of the St. John’s Ambulance Brigade, and all of the voluntary agencies that you know so well today. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I think hundreds of people volunteered, and when I say volunteered, by the way, we volunteered to go without salary, just to go wherever the government sent us to help survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And I knew we were going somewhere where it was warm because we were issued with a summer kit. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I couldn’t tell my mother where I was going. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">My father, by the way, died when I was 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">So, I— my father wasn’t there to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">But I knew we must be going somewhere where it was warm, but where? </span><span class="sentence" id="199">You know, one had no idea, and I must say, I lied to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I said I was going to a camp in <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> for about a month, and when we came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> I would call her. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And, of course, on February the 19", 1944, we got aboard a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and sailed, and about a month later in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> , landed in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Port Said</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  Can we go back for a moment?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">QUESTION:  What sort of — when you signed up to do this? </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Was there training for all of you? </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Did you all meet together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  All 200 people? </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So, could you describe that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  Not all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">The two of age groups met individually, and we had <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">training camps</span> at one of the <span class="DLF">Rothschild estates</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I was a cook in one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So, the people would not only eat decently, but be able to attend the various sessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">There was some very good people who came and talked about what we might find, but who would know what we would find? </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Nobody had any experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">What happened in these training sessions is that we got to know each other, and we were all as different as chalk from cheese. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Many of us didn’t know each other, and it was a way of getting to know each other, getting to know the people who were doing the training. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">We were absolutely green when we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , and as we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from Port Said down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> , there were men on horseback along the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Port Said</span> down to Cairo, there were men on horseback along the train shooting at us, just for fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And, we were under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">You know, and when I think of it, I don’t think we were really scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Who expected to be shot at? </span><span class="sentence" id="222">You know, you’re coming to do relief work. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">We were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maadi</span> , M-a- a-d-1, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">We were allowed to read army records of what was happening, and that’s when we really got to know what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">The British were brining in Yugoslavs from the coast of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dalmatia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">There was one camp that held about 20,000 people, and there was another camp which we — we, the new units — were sent up to take care of on the Suez Canal, a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Khataba</span> <span class="DLF">Suez Canal</span> , a place called Khataba, K-h-a-t-a-b-a, and when these people came in, they were emaciated. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">They had women who were breastfeeding children of four and two. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Their breasts were like envelopes. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">They had suffered tremendous malnutrition. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">The British had taken them from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dalmatia</span> to southern Italy, which was liberated, and then brought them into <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> <span class="REGION">southern Italy</span> , which was liberated, and then brought them into Egypt, but I must say the food that was provided for them was excellent. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">The sun didn’t hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">They lived in <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">There were very few men. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">They were mostly women and children, boys of 14 who had been in the army, who had lost limbs. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And gradually they recovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And my job at that time was to set up <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Well, how do you set up <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> for children when you have — there were two trained teachers, in fact, but no books, no pencils. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">We had learned some Yugoslav, and some of us were better at it than others. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">The army was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">You could always get around the quartermaster. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And I discovered that there were little white stones in the sand in the <span class="DLF">desert</span> on which we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">So, we gathered the stones, and this how we taught them to write. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">We had — we were given a couple of <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> , and then the ladies from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> , as there are always ladies who want to do good, came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with shoes, and most of these children hadn’t worn shoes in their life, and they were afraid of these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">But we say to them, “Look, these ladies really are very kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">They’re also bringing clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">While they are here, please wear the shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">When they’re gone, you can take them off.” </span><span class="sentence" id="248">It was rather nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I remember that instant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  How did you use the stones for writing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">ANSWER:  Oh, you formed letters with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Later on, we were able to get some paper, and the ladies from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> actually were very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">When we told them what we needed, they began to send paper and pencils in, and what we did, we sent some people from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> over to the larger camp of refugees, where they were trained to be teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">They were trained in one month to be schoolteachers and came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">They did a remarkable job. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">There was a war on, and everything was possible during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I think also because most — well, I think almost all of us in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> had suffered the bombing and suffered the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">We could compromise, we could change things around, we learned very quickly to put up <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> , we were sleeping four of us in a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I remember the dreadful latrines, which were seemed to me a mile long, and with hession, a sort of canvas in between, and you lived like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">We ate fairly well. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I was never sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Some people got dysentery. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Everything we ate on our own, which we weren’t sure of, we put potassium tablets in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> to disinfect any nasty creatures, and we lived that way until October of ’44.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">QUESTION:  I know you’re going to move the next <span class="NPIP">site</span> , but let me ask you, when you saw these folks from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , what was your first impression? </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Were they telling the stories of what had happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  They didn’t have to tell stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">You looked at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">You looked at the babies with big stomachs and big heads, and some women were breastfeeding children of two and children of four. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">She was feeding two babies, because they had had no real food for so long. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">In our <span class="INT_SPACE">units</span> , by the way, there were many doctors who volunteered, women, and they immediately set up a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , but we got a measles epidemic, and in eight weeks, I think, we buried — no, six weeks, we buried over a hundred children, and that was dreadful because we lived within the <span class="BUILDING">hospital compound</span> , and they crying of these women was absolutely dreadful, dreadful. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">To lose a child, no parent should bury a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">It was awful for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  So, you were in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for how long?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER:  Ten months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  Ten months?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">QUESTION:  So, did you consider yourself now a seasoned relief worker at the end of the ten months?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">ANSWER:  I never even thought of it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We had a job to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">We did our job. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">The Yugoslavs, as they got well, entertained us. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">They had beautiful singing voices, and they would sing in four, five parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">There were some others who were musicians, and they were very nice people, very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">They were very clean people. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">A lot of them, I would say for the most part, were peasant people, but, you know, they were human beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">QUESTION:  And so then, why did you — why were you sent away from that situation to another situation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  Oh, because southern Italy was liberated, and the allies were getting ready for the liberation of <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> <span class="REGION">southern Italy</span> was liberated, and the allies were getting ready for the liberation of Yugoslavia, which we had been trained to enter. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Trained in the sense that we learned the language, we knew where we were going, we knew the kinds of jobs we would do, and because of the work we had done in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , we were trained to take care of Yugoslavs who had gone through <span class="NPIP">hell</span> in this war. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">When we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , I happened to have been in the first unit of ten people who were sent over to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> in preparation for going into <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , and Teeter was approached by the British American armies. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I’m not quite sure of the chain of command. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">He said, “We’ll do the job ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Send us the goods.” </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">They did a very good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So, here we were, the rest of the unit had come into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , we were sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">The Italians were very pleased to see us. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">The Italians were very nice actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">They were living under appalling conditions, having suffered German occupation and British occupation, and they would have liked us to have stayed, but we really had no job to do in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And then we heard one organization working in <span class="REGION">southern Italy</span> called the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">They had, I think it was one representative at the time, a man called Reuben Resnick, working there, and we thought it would be an excellent idea if we could be seconded or loaned to this outfit so that we could help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">We had been given by the army, as had all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span> , a three hundred weight <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and a three ton <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">We all learned to drive that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dodge</span> which was double the clutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">It was terrifying, but we could all drive them, and we had lots of supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And so in talking to the army, and the heads of the units did so, we asked if we could join the American organization and they said, “Certainly, and take all your supplies with you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="306">It was a lot of give and take in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">They’re much more difficult today. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And so we loaned ourselves to the Joint. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">We went up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> to start with. </span><span class="sentence" id="311"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> was still occupied, I remember, because as it was liberated, some of our boys took matzohs up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> for the first Passover of the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I was helping to get ready the first legal transport going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I think it left on April the 12", if my memory serves me, and I remember Moshe Shertock - I think, yes, that was his name — went with us, and I and somebody from the Joint, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , or Gaynor Israel Jacobson, worked on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and got that going, and it was very interesting because there were “X” number of certificates. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">People still had to have certificates from the British government to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and let’s assume that we had 300, and they were all numbered. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">As people got on, the cards of those in front were taken and given to others at the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">So, although 300 were supposed to be on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , probably there were 400 or 500. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I never did know how many got on, and that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> went off. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">That was one of the things we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">We also, which were helping people who would come in from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> in small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I remember, the women would come in with hand grenades around their waists, great big burly women, very nice, but terrifying. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And we met a lot of people, and then, of course, the Germans were still trying to bomb us, and I know, I remember very distinctly, when the Germans came over, of course, the Americans — the American civilians who hadn’t seen any of this stuff, any of the bombing, would rush to the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , and we Britishers would rush under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> because we knew what shattered glass could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">It was an interesting time. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">When — yes, it was an interesting time, and as <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> began to be liberated, some of our people were going up north. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">When <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> was liberated, I was asked by the European director of the Joint Distribution Committee, a very wonderful man called Dr. Joseph Schwartz. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">He was a rabbi by training, and really a very, very wonderful human being, one of my heroes. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">He asked me if, when <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> was liberated, I would go into <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> with their director, and of course, who would refuse? </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And, I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> — well, the war was still on — when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were liberated, and people, I think, don’t realize that so many thousands of people had been incarcerated in concentration camps and labor camps, and the army had no place for them once they were liberated, and the only thing they thought of doing was sending these people <span class="BUILDING">home</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> , and the army had no place for them once they were liberated, and the only thing they thought of doing was sending these people home. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">So, being in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> at the time of the end of the war, suddenly the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> began to come in with these young men and women, many of them spitting blood from tuberculosis, no families. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Out of a total, I think, of 70,000 Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , there were about a total of 10,000 who survived all together, both in hiding and among those who came back, and I remember some of them having to sleep in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">It was summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">It was June when they got back. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">They had to sleep in the <span class="DLF">street</span> because there were no <span class="BUILDING">sanitarium</span> — no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sanitarium beds</span> for them, and it was very, very difficult because none of them family. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">There were girls with no sisters or brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">There were boys with no family. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Occasionally, you’d see an adult who son or daughters had been killed, and this organization, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, set up a <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> with a very wonderful local Greek lady called Mrs. Mossieri. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I’m sure her children are still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">She was a go-getter, and she helped to set up this <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I went with Israel Jacobson to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time to meet with Golda Meir and Mr. Sheretz Shatok (ph), and I can’t think of the other gentleman’s name at the moment, to talk to them about supplies that we would need and also people were beginning to go through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> illegally. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">It was very easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Perez was next to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">They sent in some of their units of workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">There were people, ostensibly press agents. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">All the marvelous people, and one of the things that we asked at that time was that you slow down the movement because the British would come to what was known as a Hachshara, a camp, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Perez</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> at Perez, and count the individuals there. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And I remember the one day they came and they said, “Where is everybody?” </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And we said, “They’ve gone <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="346">That was nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">QUESTION:  So, who were you working for then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  I was working as a volunteer with the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">QUESTION:  So, you had left the British.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">ANSWER:  Yes, we all split up. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">That whole unit of ten persons was split up. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Some people went into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Most of them stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">There was a lot of work to do in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> because people were coming into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to try and go either to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or to register with a <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> , if an <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> was open, to join family in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or to leave Europe — one thing people wanted to do was to leave Europe at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION:  Were you considered — I’m not going to use the word traitor, because that 1s obviously much too extreme, but British policy was one thing about illegal immigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">You were now working for an American organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Did you feel as if you were 1n some sense working against the policy of the Brits?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">QUESTION:  You didn’t?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">ANSWER:  No, I was working to help refugees, survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And that’s all I was doing, and whenever or wherever I could do it best was all that matter to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">It never occurred to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">I don’t think I’m a political animal, actually, but no, that never occurred to me, and the Americans had supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">You see, after the war, I suppose, the Americans realized a) they might have done more before the war, and b) they had money. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">The British were bankrupt by now. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">The British had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">They had no foreign currency. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Everything was bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">They had no <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I know how my family was living. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">No, I never felt disloyal at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I was only working to help survivors.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">QUESTION:  So, what was this trip? </span><span class="sentence" id="374">You went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">ANSWER:  No, we flew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">QUESTION:  You flew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">ANSWER:  Yes, we flew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">QUESTION:  Was that your first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> trip?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  Yes, it was my first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> ride.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  Was that scary?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  I don’t think I had time to be scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">No, it wasn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">That’s not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">It wasn’t my first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">In 1943, no, I beg your pardon, at the end of 1944, I was — I received word that my mother was ill, and I managed to hitchhike on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , to Croyden Airport, and it was interesting because when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Croyden</span> <span class="BUILDING">Croyden Airport</span> , and it was interesting because when I got to Croyden there was a big loud thump as a bomb, and I thought that the bombing was finished, and I said to the porter who was helping me off, I said, “What on earth is that?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="386">Oh,” he said, “that’s a doodlebug, lady.” </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Doodlebug would be bombs which were unmanned that they were sending from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> and they suddenly stopped and dropped. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I saw my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">She was delighted, of course, to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">She did survive that illness, and I managed to get back on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And, so, I arrived back about a month later. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">That was my — sorry, that was my first — the trip to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was my first plan trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">QUESTION:  So, let me ask you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">You had told your mother that you were going to <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> for a month to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , right? </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Well, obviously, you had been away for more than a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">ANSWER:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION:  Had you been writing to her so she finally knew what it was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">ANSWER:  No, she only heard from me once I landed in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">The mail was so bad, very few people had access to telephones, and they were often not working. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I don’t think it even worried her. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">My older brother, who actually was 21 years older than I, when I told him I was going to volunteer, he said, “Mother will be terribly upset.” </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I said, “I have talked to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">She thinks it’s a wonderful idea.” </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Absolutely true. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And I didn’t tell him, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I didn’t tell anybody in the family because you were sworn to secrecy. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> could be sunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And so they only heard from me after I arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">QUESTION:  Before we talk a little bit more about <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , are there any particular people, incidents, that you remember in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> that really matter to you that you think might be important for people to know about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  Initially, there weren’t individuals that one would single out. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Everybody who I knew was doing a tremendous job. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">As I say, living in <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> in the <span class="DLF">desert</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">We didn’t feel that we were suffering in any way. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I guess we weren’t being bombed, which was rather nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">We had a job to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">So, <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Occasionally, we could get into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> and see where normal people lived and had normal facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">No, <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> was okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">QUESTION:  You are referring to the <span class="INT_SPACE">loo</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, which, you know, we were using <span class="DLF">trenches</span> in the <span class="DLF">desert</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">When we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , conditions there, 1n a sense, were not as good as in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> because the Italians had no heating in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in which were builted (ph) and there were little fires in the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> with pipes going out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Fortunately, there was no carbon monoxide coming out of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">The Italians were suffering very badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">So, and we had no gripes. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I mean, we were well taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">By now, we had winter uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">We were dressed, by the way, as American army officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">We had PX facilities, which, to us, were fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">You know, we hadn’t seen some of the things we saw in the PX since before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">We had very little money, but that didn’t matter, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">QUESTION:  Did they give you spending money?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">ANSWER:  We had ten shillings, which at that time was, I suppose, something near two dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">That paid for the dobe, the laundry, and whatever was left over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">QUESTION:  Ten shillings per what? </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Per month? </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Per week?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">ANSWER:  I think it was — it must have been a week because there was lots of laundry — yes, it was ten shillings a week, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">It would’ve have had to been. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Maybe it was a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Money never bothered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">There was nowhere to spend it, anyway, and when we were in the <span class="DLF">desert</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , there certainly was no PX. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">The only time we met the PX was when we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> because the Americans were there, and they had the PX and they were very generous. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">The American boys in the army were quite extraordinary. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">They would give away their bomber jackets when they thought we were cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">You know, they’d pass them over to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">They’d offer to buy anything they could for us in the PX, and those who had money were able to take care of themselves, and people were nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">You know, they’d buy stuff that we all could share. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">There were foodstuffs available in the PX which we hadn’t seen in a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">QUESTION:  Can you give us an idea of what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">ANSWER:  Well, there were canned nuts. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I remember loving peanuts, which we hadn’t seen in years and years and years. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">The only thing we had that was cheap was we could buy liquor at seven and sixpence, I remember, for a bottle of scotch, and it was very good, I gather, for bribing people. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I didn’t drink, so, you know, I lost out there, but you know, these things in a sense didn’t bother one. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">We were fed but we were doing a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">We weren’t concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I must be honest there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">QUESTION:  So, what was the difference between the kind of food that the refugees would get that you met in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">ANSWER:  In <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">QUESTION:  I mean, in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and what you had?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">ANSWER:  Or in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  Or in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">ANSWER:  Well, they cooked Yugoslav food, and they cooked very well, and occasionally they would invite us to come and enjoy a meal with them because our food was cooked by the Arab cooks, and it was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">There was nothing wrong with it, but Yugoslavs are very good cooks. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">It was heavier food than we were used to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">QUESTION:  Who provided them with food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  The army, and I suppose at that time it was the British army since the British were in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , in control.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">QUESTION:  And then what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Who provided them? </span><span class="sentence" id="470">The same thing — the army provided...</p>
<p>ANSWER:  The army provided the food for the refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="471"><span class="BUILDING">Camps</span> were immediately set up. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">One in Santa Maria di Bari, which is down on the heel of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">That was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish DP camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Then, there was another one in Cine Citta in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , which was the movie studio in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cine Citta</span> in Rome, which was the <span class="BUILDING">movie studio</span> in Rome. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">That was set up as a displaced persons camp because a lot of people were released who didn’t belong in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camp</span> because a lot of people were released who didn’t belong in Italy. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">There were Romanians, Hungarians, they were all nationalities, and no <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to go to, or they couldn’t go because those <span class="NPIP">places</span> weren’t liberated yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">So...</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So, there were a lot of holding actions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  Yeah, lots of holding actions for these people, and for others, they were sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I don’t know to what <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> they were sent. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I’m talking not only of Jews at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">A lot of the Russians were sent back, as you probably know, and I don’t think a lot of them lasted. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">A lot of them had been volunteer workers with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Some of them were Slave laborers. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">It was a very, very difficult stage for the army because, for the most part, they were still flushing out the Nazis, and yet they had this civilian population whom they didn’t understand, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">They tried to treat them when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were liberated as though they were former Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">They locked them up in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> until, you know, the army came to understand who these people were and until there was communication with the voluntary agencies like the American Joint Distribution Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">QUESTION:  When was the first time that you saw Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Was that in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">ANSWER:  There were very few — there were three or four or five or six 1n among the Yugoslavs, but I think they didn’t stay long in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I think they were able to cross the Suez into <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">QUESTION:  And was the same true in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">ANSWER:  No, in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , it was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Firstly, there were the displaced people. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">They were Yugoslav Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">They were Russian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">They were all kinds of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">They were Italian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , there was quite a community of Jews who had been in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">There was a Jewish orphanage in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish orphanage</span> in Rome, for example, which had been taken over by the Catholics. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">The Catholics had taken the Jewish children from the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and had hidden them in their <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and then they’d hidden them again, and when the Catholic orphanage was bombed, the one that was out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the American Joint Distribution Committee rebuilt it for them as a thank you for having saved the Jewish children, and then our units — because we had volunteers — the Joint had administrators who, we had volunteers who set up the <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> <span class="BUILDING">Catholic orphanage</span> was bombed, the one that was out of town, the American Joint Distribution Committee rebuilt it for them as a thank you for having saved the Jewish children, and then our units — because we had volunteers — the Joint had administrators who, we had volunteers who set up the orphanages again. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">They had experience in working in <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">It was quite an exciting time in a way to do positive things — to see children smiling, children who hadn’t been incarcerated, because we’d seen firstly the Yugoslav children who had been starving, and we began to get pictures of what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">We used to occasionally get shown German film that had been captured of the Nazis throwing children over the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> , you know, it was ghastly, ghastly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">QUESTION:  Did you travel around <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> or did you stay primarily in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">ANSWER:  No, I traveled around. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I traveled around <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION:  So, what was your job, then, in terms of traveling around? </span><span class="sentence" id="508">What was your task?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">ANSWER:  Right, for example, if I went down, let’s say to Santa Maria di Bari, I would go there, first you’d see how the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was running. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">It was amazing how, without any experience, one became an expert. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I did have something kind of social administration training, and I think I was instinctively an administrator. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">I would see what was needed 1n that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">For example, we had one of our unit members in charge of a search bureau which we set up immediately because the important thing was to try to reunite families. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">We had no baby clothes because once people — the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were liberated and people began to lead normal lives, women began to menstruate again. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">They hadn’t menstruated all through the war, and being normal human beings they began to get pregnant and have babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">We needed sanitary napkins for the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">We needed baby clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">We needed special food for pregnant women. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">There were some older people who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">We needed special food for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">We needed doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">We needed more social workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And one could assess this, and gradually these people came in to work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">It was exciting in the sense that you felt you could do something positive, and then the most important thing, I think, at that time was the search bureaus that we set up. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And they were interesting because, for example, you had to very quickly learn that the name “Schwartz”, for example, S-c-h-w- a-r-t-z, can be spelled 30 different ways, and how do you distinguish? </span><span class="sentence" id="526">How do you find Ivan Schwartz from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> , for example? </span><span class="sentence" id="527">You then knew you had to have his birthdays, his parents’ names, their birthdays, where they were born, and you set up a very good system internationally. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">The <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , at one point after <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was liberated, was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arolsen</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">There was a big unit in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> set up by the World Jewish Congress and there was a big unit also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and I think they were right. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">The most important thing was to help people find family. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">This went on for years. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">It still goes on. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">People are still finding relatives, close relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">QUESTION:  Could you describe how people — there were no computers,</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Absolutely not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">QUESTION:  So-</p>
<p>ANSWER:  And, no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriters</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">QUESTION:  Right, so how did people find these lists? </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Where were the lists placed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">ANSWER:  Okay, Ill give you an example. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">If we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and you came and you said, “My name is Joan Koppelbaum. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I had a mother and father and three sisters and four brothers, and I managed to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I don’t know what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">My parents, I think, were taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I think my brothers and sisters may have escaped.” </span><span class="sentence" id="545">What we would do, we would send these lists of people who are asking for relatives to each <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and each <span class="BUILDING">office</span> would contact the next <span class="BUILDING">office</span> to see if they had any of these people registered with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">We did use the Red Cross, but we found we were more efficient, I must be honest, than the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Firstly, the Red Cross took much longer than we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">We knew that time was of the essence. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">These lists were passed around, and we all got copies of these lists. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">So, if we were looking for your relatives, we could look and say, “Hey! </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Your aunt, we haven’t found your parents yet, but your aunt is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And very often, of course, when these people came to our <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> , all the <span class="DLF">walls</span> had their names written on them, and one would write, “I’m Ivan Schwartz. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I’m going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Or “I’m Ivan Schwartz. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I’m going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">You will find me. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I will be with so-and-so.” </span><span class="sentence" id="558">It was like the tom-toms working. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And in the beginning, this 1s how people found each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">QUESTION:  So, people would leave little messages about -</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Oh, they’d scribble on our <span class="DLF">walls</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="561">QUESTION:  On your <span class="DLF">walls</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">QUESTION:  Not on paper?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">ANSWER:  Oh, on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And we had, let’s say — we had five or six <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , and these messages were on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">We would also take notes from them, but — and, sometimes, a father would find a son in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and I can’t tell you the emotion of that moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Everybody was so thrilled, and everybody cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">You know, I still get emotional because I saw so much of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">It was wonderful, wonderful, and then you would hear the sadness. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">You know, “Your mother got killed.” </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Or “I don’t know where your mother is.” </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And sometimes it would take months and months to trace a family member, and as I say, they are still tracing family members. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">I hear stories from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> today where they are still finding people alive in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> who they thought had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">You know, in the old days, where we had immigration at the turn of the century, relatives lost touch with each other, and after this calamity, they certainly lost contact.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">QUESTION:  Amy, you say that it was so wonderful to be able to do good things for people. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">That’s clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">In these first two settings, in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , it must also have been difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">There must have been hard times because people are not coming out of this whole. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">There’s so much loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">ANSWER:  But we hadn’t suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">They had suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">This was the difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">We were there to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I don’t think we ever thought of ourselves in this — I’m being honest, I don’t think I ever felt that I had suffered anything at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">You know, it was just so wonderful when you found a relative for somebody or when you were able to find a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for somebody to live in. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I don’t think, and I’m not saying we weren’t selfish people, we were normal human beings, but the job was so in a sense exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Can you imagine going up to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that’s been liberated and the Jews there finding — there were Jews, mostly we were British or the American in charge of the Joint would come up, and they’d see us in uniform or they’d see us, members of the Jewish Relief Units with the Shield of David on our shoulders and, you know, the Star of David on our berets. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">It was so hard for them to believe that Jews had survived as Jews without being taken prisoner or had come to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I don’t think — I can’t imagine anybody that I know of, and we were all very different people, being concerned for ourselves in that sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I don’t think we could’ve been because we might eventually have gone <span class="BUILDING">home</span> more quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I mean, some of us stayed on for years to help until the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camps</span> were liberated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">QUESTION:  And, describe again — you wore an American army uniform.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="593">ANSWER:  Yes, I was an American army officer in uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">My papers said I had the status of a lieutenant colonel, and it said, in fact, on my identity card that if I were taken prisoner by the Germans, I was to be treated as an officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I still have those documents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">QUESTION:  And you wore the American army uniform in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="597">ANSWER:  No, in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , I was in British army officer’s uniform.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="598">QUESTION:  And you wore skirts, or you wore-?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="599">ANSWER:  We wore skirts. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Women didn’t wear trousers at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">We wore skirts, and some of the American women had nylon stockings. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">They must have been an inch thick, now that I remember, but of course, they got them at the PX and they gave us some. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">No, I think they gave us, I don’t think they sold them to us, and it was wonderful to wear a decent pair of hose. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">You know, we hadn’t had them in years. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">The Americans were very generous, I must say, very generous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="606">QUESTION:  How did you clean your clothes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">ANSWER:  That’s a very good question, isn’t it? </span><span class="sentence" id="608">When it was warm, of course, everything was washed. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I think the army had a cleaning service. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">I remember, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , there was an American cleaners, and I met somebody who worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> with me, and she said, “You used to come around every week and ask if anybody had cleaning, and you would take it to the cleaners for us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="611">I don’t remember it, but she told me this was so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="612">QUESTION:  I was wondering because uniforms are fairly heavy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">QUESTION:  Except in the summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">ANSWER:  Right, no, we had, through the Red Cross, I think, or through the PX, we had a cleaning system. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Funny, those things I don’t even recall because I suppose that wasn’t important to US.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">QUESTION:  Was there any difference in status between the women who went over in the relief group and the men who went over? </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Were the men not lieutenant colonels, but higher than that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="619">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">We all had the same status. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Everybody had the same status. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">We had one unit leader, a woman who ran our unit was Phyllis Gerson, who after the war, the British government gave what’s known as a MB, a Master- a Member, rather, of the British Empire award to her for having served in this unit, and the British government was very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">They so valued our work, I think, that after the war they presented us with the same medals they gave to fighting servicemen. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I have mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I would never use them, even the decorative ones, because I didn’t think we earned them. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">You know, we weren’t fighting, but I thought it was a very generous gesture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">QUESTION:  Okay, I think we’ll take a break now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">ANSWER:  Excellent. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">How’s it going?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">QUESTION:  Fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">End of Tape #1 Tape #2</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Amy, let’s go onto <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">You were describing circumstances in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> which sounded much worse in some ways than what you found in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and these were mainly Greek Jews who were coming back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">ANSWER:  Yes, these were Greek Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">The situation was worse because in — firstly, in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , we had many volunteers working with the people who the British were bringing in from the coast of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dalmatia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">In <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , we were two foreigners, there was the head of the Joint Distribution Committee and I, and some local workers, and in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , they hadn’t been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and no matter how much people had suffered, they hadn’t suffered the brutality, the inhumanity of the Germans in the sense of the people who came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> had. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">We had girls who came back who had tattooed across their stomachs, “Nur fuer ofitserin” “Only for officers”. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">They were used in brothels. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">The boys, very many of them, had been castrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">So, in addition to all their suffering, in one sense, the suffering was even worse than others, and yet, none of them had families to come back to. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">There wasn’t a mother and a father. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">If there was a brother, there was nobody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">If there was a sister, there was nobody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">There were no complete families left in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">As I mentioned earlier, I remember very clearly, the population among Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> had been 70,000 before the war, and after the war there were 10,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">That’s a tremendous percentage of Jews who were killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">QUESTION:  Were most of the people who came back from the concentration camps from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> from Auschwitz, or from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> that they had been sent to on death marches?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">ANSWER:  They were from different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="648">I don’t think any of them had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I think they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , which were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">QUESTION:  This young girl that you said had a tattoo on her that said, “Only for officers”, was she a Jewish girl?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, I’m talking about the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">There were some non-Jews who came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I must say we helped them, too, where we could, that we didn’t differentiate. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">For the most part, 1t was Jews who were deported.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">QUESTION:  What was the most difficult thing for you in helping these people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">ANSWER:  That we couldn’t help them enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">They were so ill, so many of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">They were suffering from TB, and there were no <span class="BUILDING">sanitaria</span> where you could put them and nurse them back to health. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">You had, you know, we had to set up <span class="NPIP">places</span> extempore and put them in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">You didn’t have the medical facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">You didn’t have the medicines, and at that time, streptomycin wasn’t yet available. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">So, you know, these people were really suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">They were very, very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">They suffered tremendously, and it was very difficult to see it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">QUESTION:  So, you — tuberculosis is very catching, so did you separate all with people who had tuberculosis, or couldn’t you even know who had tuberculosis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">ANSWER:  One didn’t know who had tuberculosis. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Some were obviously tubercular because they were spitting blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">We were not concerned for ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">It’s an interesting question you ask, because it never occurred to me that this was a contagious disease that I might get. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">It had never occurred to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I’m sure none of the other workers had thought of it in that sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">The main concern was to get these people treated, and <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> had very few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> available. </span><span class="sentence" id="673"><span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> had suffered tremendously anyway under the Germans, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">They were occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And that was a very difficult time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">QUESTION:  Did many die?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="677">ANSWER:  Of our people-</p>
<p>QUESTION:  No, I mean of the survivors who were coming back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">ANSWER:  No, I don’t remember them dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I don’t remember them dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Maybe they had survived because they were so strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Don’t forget, they come out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , had been put onto <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , I’m sure without any nursing facilities, and sent across Europe back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">They had to have been strong to start with. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">I’m sure the weak ones hadn’t survived in the first instance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">QUESTION:  You know, I think it’s interesting, people don’t necessarily think about how difficult it is after a war, what it means to clean up and repair and at the same time take care of individuals, so the picture is very graphic when you describe it this way, and you describe people sleeping in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> because there were not enough <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">ANSWER:  There weren’t — they were sleeping — I remember, I saw it, sleeping on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> in Constitution Square in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Constitution Square</span> in Athens. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">As I say, it was a warm summer, but there were no <span class="NPIP">places</span> to put them. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Eventually, gradually, we managed to find <span class="NPIP">places</span> , but some of those men who had been through absolute <span class="NPIP">hell</span> were now sitting — sleeping in the square. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And some of them were very angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I remember, one came into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> once — it sounds funny at this point — but, again, he was going to shoot Israel Jacobson, and I sort of stood between, the brave one yet stupid, and he said, “Hey that’s a Mauser. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I always wanted a Mauser. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">What do you want for it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And this boy, I know this instinct so clearly, and Israel Jacobson 1s alive — he can tell you the story, too — he said, “I want 25 greenbacks.” </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And I don’t remember whether he wanted them with the yellow seal or the red seal. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">They thought the different seals had different values, and we bought it from him, and I remember, we got a friend to row us out to the Aegian and we threw the gun into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="695">That was just — I remember that particularly, because when I stood between them, this wrist was flicked out that way, and this one this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Eventually my wrists were put back, I had terribly swollen hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">So, that was all right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">QUESTION:  Why did that happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">ANSWER:  Well, they went for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">You know, they were angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">It was all our fault, wasn’t it? </span><span class="sentence" id="702">No, no, you can understand these men, for heaven’s sake. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">They came back, there were no families, and they wanted money and they knew we had, but not in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="704">But, he came — he was going to kill anybody, he thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">Maybe he didn’t, but, you know, this was a gesture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">QUESTION:  It was a loaded gun?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">ANSWER:  I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">It probably was, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">It probably was. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">He must have taken it from a German he had killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">QUESTION:  Did you get scared afterwards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">ANSWER:  There was no time, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">No, you can’t be scared just because somebody is threatening to kill somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">You know, and you got in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I had very sore hands for a bit, but that was life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">QUESTION:  Were there more women than men also in these circumstances, coming back to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , or was this a case of where there were more men than women? </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">ANSWER:  I seem to remember more men. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">There were some young girls who came back, a number of them from the island of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> , and we couldn’t send them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodes</span> because there families had been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">There were no families, and that’s when we decided together with this wonderful woman, Mrs. Mossieri, to set up this <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> to house these girls, and we helped them, of course, immediately, also to join families. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">So, some of them came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Some went to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Some of them stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Some went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">We tried to help them join families wherever we could because what 1s life without family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="726">QUESTION:  How did the non-Jewish Greek population feel when these folks came back? </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I mean, they also had suffered during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">So, I don’t know, were they able to help? </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Did they want to help? </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Or were they simply trying to get through it themselves?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="731">ANSWER:  I don’t remember the Greek hierarchy being interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Now, maybe that’s because I was so busy and never contacted them, but we were in contact with Mr. McVeigh who was the American ambassador there because there was a change of currency at one point, which we tried to fight successfully. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Spiros Sikuros was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">I went with him on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , and he was very nice because he helped us to get the Nuremburg laws rescinded. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">They were still in effect in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">ANSWER:  Yes, and I remember there was a man, a major called, Moish Perlman (ph), who later became, I think, the press attaché for the Israeli government, 1f my memory serves me, I think that’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Spiros Sikuros, whose son was in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I traveled with him and his son on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , and he was very nice, and he helped to get the laws rescinded. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">It was appalling that they were still in effect, but <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> was still trying to recover itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I don’t think they intended to keep them going, but they didn’t of themselves suggest that these laws be rescinded or the property laws be rescinded. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">It required this outside pressure to get them done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="743">QUESTION:  Now, even though people came back and there were no families, was there property, like <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> or <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> that they tried to take over?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="744">ANSWER:  That’s a good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">There were <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , but there were people living in them, and you can’t just walk into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> when somebody else has taken over your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and this required legal procedures, and it took time, and you had to have proof, and these people had to find their papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">These things were not easy, but there were lawyers employed by the Joint Distribution Committee to help these people to get property back, but it was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">It took time, especially when you had a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> where they themselves had suffered so much under the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">They were still trying to provide restitution to all the Greeks, let’s say, in addition to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">We were interested in helping the remnants of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , but the Greeks were interested in helping all Greeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">It worked slowly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">QUESTION:  Excuse me, I’m sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">ANSWER:  It worked very slowly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">QUESTION:  In <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> , the Joint Distribution Committee often went around to the families who were taken care of Jewish children, non-Jewish families, and sometimes kidnapped them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Was anything like that happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Had there been children in hiding who people wanted to keep?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="756">ANSWER:  You’re thinking particularly of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">That is a very interesting story. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Not to my knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Not to my knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I didn’t come across it. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">If it existed, I didn’t know of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">But the sad thing in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , of course, was the fact that many of these people never told the children who they kept that they were Jewish children until they were dying themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And, of course, you know, you now have this Jewish school in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> in Warsaw where those children’s children attend. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">It’s very — tough, tough questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">It’s very hard to take 1n a baby of six weeks and four years later, when you’ve loved it and nurtured it, to give it up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">QUESTION:  How long were you in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="767">ANSWER:  I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> from April ’45 until August ’46.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="768">QUESTION:  A long time, April ’45 to August 46.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">ANSWER:  I didn’t think of it in that sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">I was working.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="771">QUESTION:  So, were you traveling around <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> in the same way you were traveling around <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="772">ANSWER:  Not as much because you couldn’t — 1n the beginning, you couldn’t travel around <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">The only way to travel that’s safe from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> was by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">There were no <span class="DLF">bridges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="775">They had to be built. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">There were no <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="777">That’s what I’m saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Yes, we traveled a little to see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> that we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">We’d go up to — I’m trying to remember — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yanina</span> , which was north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , or to the south, but you couldn’t travel around much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="780">QUESTION:  How did you travel when you did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="781">ANSWER:  To <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> , by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">QUESTION:  And on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> , how did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">ANSWER:  We had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeeps</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army Jeeps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="784">QUESTION:  So, you didn’t go with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> and a donkey?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="785">ANSWER:  No, I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">No, nobody had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> and stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="787">QUESTION:  And was your work in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> very similar to what you did in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="788">You were setting up- ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">ANSWER:  I set up a welfare agency in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> <span class="BUILDING">welfare agency</span> in Athens. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">These people needed money to buy, and my feeling was you didn’t hand out money to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">It was degrading to them to have to receive charity in that sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">And I set up a system of relief whereby they came to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , if it was one person, there was that set amount. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">If it was two people, or a family, there were different amounts, and we gave them checks, and they went to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> and cashed their checks. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">This was my feeling, and always has been that the only thing that people often have left for themselves 1s their dignity, and this to me was one way of giving it back to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">It worked very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="796">QUESTION:  And how did they cash a check if they didn’t have an account?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="797">ANSWER:  It was a Joint check, and we had an arrangement with the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> , of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">The <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> knew us. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Our money was coming in through the Bank of Greece. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">I think Varvaresso was the president, and we knew him quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">I remember on one occasion, when we had deposited quite a large sum of money, and had been assured that that money would not be devalued, because <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> was constantly devaluing, and one day when Israel Jacobson was on his way by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , I remember, up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> , I heard that the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> that morning had devalued the drachma, which meant that the $150,000 we had changed was now worth about $15. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">I sent somebody immediately to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> to bring him back, stop him going, which we did, and then we got in touch with the American ambassador — I think he was an ambassador, I’m not sure already. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">I don’t think he was consul. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">I think he was an ambassador, Mr. McVeigh, and they said, “Well, we just have to accept this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And Spiros Sikuros of Fox Films, I think he was, said, “Well, have to accept this.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And, I said —and I said to Israel Jacobson, “We don’t accept this. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">This is Jewish money that is hard to come by. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">It’s voluntary donations. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">We’ve got to fight this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And I remember we fought it, and we got our money back. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">I felt very good about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="812">QUESTION:  How does one fight a general devaluation of currency?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="813">ANSWER:  Well, you go to the president who has assured you two days before there would be no devaluation, and you face him with his promise. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">I mean, you’re not scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">You can’t have 150,000 then the next day have 15, and you’re trying to feed people who’ve been starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">It’s amazing how much courage you get when, you know, there’s something really important here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="817">QUESTION:  Was there a lot of black market in these <span class="NPIP">places</span> <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> in these places where you were, that you remember’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="818">ANSWER:  I’m sure there was. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">It wasn’t talked about. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">In a sense, it wasn’t <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="821">If they got, let’s say, cheese given them in cans, you got sick of that cheese. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">I’ve tasted. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">So, you changed it for eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">If that’s <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , there was <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And there were people were very glad to get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">Or there would be chocolate, which was very nutritious, horrible stuff, and you could swap that for something else, for a can of bully beef or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">The <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> never bothered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Firstly, 1t was people getting foods that they wanted, and foods they felt they needed, and they were trading. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">I don’t see that that was such — they weren’t stealing anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">They were just exchanging, and since it wasn’t an official exchange, it was known as a <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="831">This happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="832">It certainly happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I didn’t see it as anything bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="834">QUESTION:  You seem to be describing barter, which I think may be somewhat different than <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , where people do make money, and-</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Oh, you’re talking of jewelry and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">That happened, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I didn’t see it in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">The first time I really came across it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="838">QUESTION:  Now, when you gave people money, or checks so they could have some money, was this sufficient so they could rent an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , perhaps, or was this really to enable them to get food and sustain themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="839">ANSWER:  Well, it was to help them more so to find <span class="NPIP">places</span> to live, and there was a group in the community who was finding <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">They weren’t all Athenians. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">So, they didn’t all own property in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , and they were able to, if they had money, they could rent a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and they could buy food, and eventually we got food in through the American Joint Distribution Committee, which we could contribute both to individuals and through the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="842">The rabbi was there, Rabbi Basel, I think his name was. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">They were taken care of, minimally, I must say, because this 1s all we could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">The war had just finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">It was hard to get stuff put aboard a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="846">Money was the thing that you could get. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">So, we would go into, or sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> for goods, for clothing, or to <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> for goods and clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">We were fortunate enough that we had — there was Mr. Charles Passman in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , who was with the American Joint Distribution committee also, a wonderful character. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">I knew him, and he would send us food and send us clothing, and I think we did it also through the Jewish Community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="850">You bring back memories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="851">QUESTION:  I’m going to go back to something because I’m going to forget it if I don’t remind you and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">You said you met Golda Meir on a trip from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="853">What was she doing and what were you meeting about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="854">ANSWER:  Well, she was a member of, I suppose, the hierarchy in the British — no, sorry, beg your pardon — in the Palestine Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">She was one of the political animals as well as Sharett, and I can’t think of the others at the moment who I also met. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">We went to see her essentially because people were coming into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> from the north, escapees. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I think the war was still on, and coming down to the hachshara (ph) that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Perez</span> , and there wasn’t enough <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="858">They weren’t moving out quickly enough on the leaderships. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I must say the Joint wasn’t arranging illegal movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">I know that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="861">QUESTION:  It wasn’t?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="862">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">It had a very clean nose in that sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">I think they were scared in the sense that if they did anything illegally, and the American government discovered it, they wouldn’t trust them. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">I know when I was working on immigration, we were terribly careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">But the Palestinians were working their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="867">We were feeding the people, and-</p>
<p>QUESTION:  I was asking you about what the meeting was about with Golda Meir.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="868">ANSWER:  Right, we went to see her because they were coming down rather quickly, and there wasn’t enough <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> in the hachshara to house them, and we really went to ask her to slow down the movement a bit so that people came in more slowly, and could be shipped out, because the hachshara was rather small, and I guess she did her stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">It was interesting meeting these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="870">QUESTION:  Did you learn to speak Greek since you were there for so long, or at least, over a year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="871">ANSWER:  I had <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> Greek. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">That’s what I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">It wasn’t very good Greek, but I had an ear for language, and could understand what was being said. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">No, I used English. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I also began to learn German. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">I had no idea I was to eventually going to end up in German speaking <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , but that I found easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And the boys, many of them spoke, or the girls also spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">They spoke English, too, a number of them, and we, of course, operated with interpreters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="879">QUESTION:  Did you interview some of these survivors that had come back? </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Did you sit down and talk with them or was work so overwhelming that that was not part of what you were doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="881">ANSWER:  Do you mean about their experiences in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> <span class="BUILDING">camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="882">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="883">ANSWER:  I don’t think they were ready to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">It never occurred to me at that time, when somebody came back, to talk about it experience in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="885">When you sat down with somebody, you talked to them about how many members of his family were there? </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Did he know where they were? </span><span class="sentence" id="887">You talked for the future, not for the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">I must say, in all my experience, I never consciously asked them to talk about their experience in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="889">Firstly, for them it was very difficult, especially since they had gone in sometimes as a family — a father and two sons, and this was the only son who survived, and purely by the grace of God, no other reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">We never asked them to. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">Some of them did tell you of their experiences, and you listened. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">We didn’t ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">They had a need to talk, and you had to have a good ear and listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">Some of it was horrific. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Some of it was horrific, but no, I never remember asking about the experience in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="896">QUESTION:  Did you ever notice that the spoke with each other?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="897">ANSWER:  No, I don’t think they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">They had certain codes, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">They hadn’t all been in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and those that had, the fact that they were together meant that they had comfort. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">They were lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">They had other people they could talk to about what they went through who would understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">I think they might also have thought we couldn’t possibly understand, and how could we? </span><span class="sentence" id="903">How could we understand the brutality and the killings and the horrific things that they had to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="904">No, you didn’t ask.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="905">QUESTION:  As you heard some of this from people, I mean, since some people did speak with you, did you — you seem to have an extremely positive outlook on life. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">I mean, it just shows in you. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Did this depress you and make you wonder about the capacity of human beings to commit horrific acts like this that you had never thought of before? </span><span class="sentence" id="908">Did you think this was just aberrant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="909">ANSWER:  No, I never thought it was aberrant. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">This was very intentional by many, many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">I think when people would tell me their stories, I used to think, “And they survived this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="912">And the important thing was to get them away from this. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">I mean, how could people go through the kind of thing they had? </span><span class="sentence" id="914">The bombing 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> was nothing compared to this, and that horrified me. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">I was terrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">No, I seem to remember also when people would come and tell some horrific stories that you couldn’t cry with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">You were there to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">I used to say to some of the people who work for me, particularly when I went into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and then <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , “We can’t cry with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">We can cry for them afterwards, but we have to help them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="920">I don’t know where this attitude came from, frankly. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">I think it’s always been there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="922">QUESTION:  So, did you sometimes cry alone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="923">ANSWER:  Oh, when we got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we would talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">We were a group living in the same apartment building, and I remember Hannah Kisch, who was a wonderful woman, originally from Lithuanian who immigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">South</span> <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> , and I remember Hannah Kisch, who was a wonderful woman, originally from Lithuanian who immigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> and came up to help us, and she would tell a story and be sobbing, you know, and we would share stories that we’d heard, but it didn’t last for long. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">We didn’t have time to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">You know, when we were working, we started, I suppose, at seven or eight in the morning, and who knows what time at night we'd finish. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">There were no days off. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">There was no closing the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> because it was dark or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">You were working all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">Sometimes, some of the people were in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">I don’t remember being, except once or twice in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> , working late into the night, or in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> when we were working on this transport to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , working I think all night through. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">I don’t remember it, but you just did it, and 1t wasn’t work, you see, you were helping people. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And I think we were lucky and a number of people who volunteered to go overseas were of similar ilk, and if they weren’t — some of them went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after the year’s contract was up, which was just as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="934">QUESTION:  I can see you’re seeing somebody in your head. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">Yes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="936">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">But that was all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">That was all right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="939">QUESTION:  Did a number of people get sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because they were not right for this kind of work? </span><span class="sentence" id="940">Or did people generally just go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on their own?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="941">ANSWER:  I know of one person who was sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="942">I think people left on their own. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">Some of them couldn’t take this kind of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Remember, except for those in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> who’d been throw the Blitz, so we’d had some kind of upheaval in our lives, the average American who came later to work, had had no upheaval. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">I remember one of the survivors writing to me after he got to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> saying — we sent him to his aunt — and he was telling me he said how terrible the food rationing was. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">Sugar was rationed she said during the war, and he said eventually he just had to pick-up and move out of her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="947">He said she was a lovely woman, but she had no understanding, and I think that’s partly answer to the question of why did it take so long for people to start talking because nobody in a sense was interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="948">QUESTION:  Did you mainly socialize with each other? </span><span class="sentence" id="949">Did you sometimes socialize with the survivors who would come?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="950">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">We socialized with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">We weren’t very many. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">When we had time to socialize. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">We ate in a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> , obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">We ate in the billets that we were put in, and some of these people were people I’d normally in normal life have as friends, and we could socialize. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">But we were on different levels. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">We were — we were foreigners. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">We were help that came in to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">We socialized with the people we employed to work with us, and that — most of them were wonderful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">You know, if you give people a chance, they will. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">Some of them were gaz/onim, gangsters in English, but a lot of them were wonderful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">You couldn’t socialize with everybody, obviously, but the people we worked with, we socialized with. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">We would have dinner with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">Invite them to our mess, you know, we were eating in an army mess, and that food was different from theirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">There wasn’t very much socialization in the sense that we use that word. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">At night, we were quite often very tired, and were glad to put our feet up. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Some of them would come and put their feet up with us and have a drink maybe and then go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="969">So, it wasn’t socialization in the general sense of the word.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">QUESTION:  Did you sleep okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">ANSWER:  Most of the time, yes, I think, under mosquito nets in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="972">It was malaria, still. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">And there’s a very nice instant I must tell you of. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">We were taking an antimalarial drug, which made us yellow, and somebody came in, I think, from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and cabled to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> that we were looking very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">We were very yellow, and so we were sent for two weeks to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> on vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">How did you tell people this was a result of — I don’t know if it was attaprin (ph), or something we were taking at the time that made us look very yellow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="977">QUESTION:  So, what was that like to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> for two weeks?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="978">ANSWER:  It was lovely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="979">QUESTION:  Where were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="980">ANSWER:  Well, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , and we went up to Rosh Pina, and met some friends who’d been working in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , and went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kibbutzim</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rosh Pina</span> , and met some friends who’d been working in Greece, and went into Kibbutzim, and it was lovely. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">It was lovely to see normal people leading normal lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , which was really a lovely, lovely <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , a lovely <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="983">It was very nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="984">QUESTION:  Did you meet up with some of the folks who had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> <span class="BUILDING">camps</span> and had -</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, they hadn’t gone yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="985">QUESTION:  They hadn’t gone yet?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="986">ANSWER:  No, I’m talking of ’45. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">No, they hadn’t gone yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="988">QUESTION:  So, you at least had in these few years a two week vacation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="989">ANSWER:  Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="990">QUESTION:  And all ten of you went?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="991">ANSWER:  Two of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="992">QUESTION:  Two of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="993">ANSWER:  Oh, you’re talking of the Jewish Relief Unit, no, when I talk of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , I was there alone with a representative of the Joint Distribution Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">Two of us went. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">No, the others were either in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> still, or had gone into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , but in terms of vacation, you never thought of vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">I’m not saying we were self-sacrificing. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">That never occurred to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">You worked, and the work wasn’t work. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">It didn’t feel like work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">It’s very difficult to explain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">You were helping people who needed help desperately, and I guess we took days off occasionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">I don’t remember, but I’m sure we did, or we went — yes, we did, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">We’d go up and see one of the <span class="BUILDING">Greek ruins</span> somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">You know, drive, take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> where you could drive to and have lunch at the <span class="BUILDING">seaside taverno</span> , which was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1006">QUESTION:  You were in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> from April ’45 to August ’46, yes? </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">So, in the beginning, it must have been much tougher, because the war is just over, or not quite over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1008">ANSWER:  In June.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1009">QUESTION:  In June, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1010">ANSWER:  The Greeks were shooting up people reading the Communist newspapers in <span class="DLF">Constitutional Square</span> , I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">That was how they celebrated the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">Our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> overlooked the <span class="DLF">Square</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1013">QUESTION:  You can see people being shot?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1014">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">You know, all in a days work, kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">At a very early age, you got used to seeing this kind of thing, and it was horrible, horrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1017">QUESTION:  What was it like a year later? </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">Were there sort of incremental changes, like every three months you could see a real difference?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1019">ANSWER:  No, supplies began to come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">For example, we were very indiscriminate still at that time in using DDT to disinfest people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">You know, in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , we disinfested the Arabs, poor souls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">God knows how much we got up our own nostrils. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">Who knew it was such a poison? </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">And we stopped using DDT at one point, but I remember puffing it into the Arabs galobiers (ph), you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">Things began to change as people began to get a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, found family, decided they would immigrate, registered with a <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> , had family members contact them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">Nobody would come in, and there was very little civilian traffic between Europe and the United States or <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , and they still couldn’t go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or Australia, and they still couldn’t go to Palestine except legally — if they were going legally on a certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">So, movement was slow, but gradually things began to get a bit better, and as I say, as people began to find relatives, things were better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">It was very slow, very slow, and people were ill for a long time, a long time, and to get property back took years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">You couldn’t see it in increments. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">It didn’t happen quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">Look how long it took to get reparations from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">They started in °45 and the reparations began to come through at the end of the ’40s, and these were with all the great powers working together and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> willing to give back in part.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1033">QUESTION:  How was it that you came to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1034">ANSWER:  In August of 1946, Dr. Joseph Schwartz, my hero, a blessing really — he really was a wonderful man with a wonderful sense of humor and a marvelous administrator — asked me if I would go up into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">He said President Truman in December of 1945, on the 22" of December, had passed — had issued a directive which enabled people who were displaced persons to get priority for American visas under the quota system. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">In other words, they still had to go through the quota, but they would get visas rather than people, let’s say, who’d lived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or <span class="REGION">South America</span> , and he said they’d had somebody there working, but who hadn’t panned out, and would I do this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">Well, I would have done anything this man asked me, and so I went up into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , but I knew nothing of American immigration law, and I must say, I sat down for four days with this American immigration law from 1924, I think it was, and then with the Truman Directive, and gradually began to get things together, and it didn’t take too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">Firstly, here was something very positive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">We were going to be able to help people to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> — displaced persons and Austrian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">And the first problem we had was that those Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> who had returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were not considered displaced persons by the consuls, but the International Refugee Organization had registered them as displaced persons, which they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">They didn’t have their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">They didn’t have their jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">Some of their family members had been killed, and so, we set up a test case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">When I say we, I was very brazen, I must confess, and I established a precedent case showing how this man — I won’t give you his name, he lives in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> today — how this man had lost family, had lost his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , had come back, had no <span class="NPIP">where</span> to live, was being housed by the American voluntary agency, and essentially he was still a displaced person, and we won the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">So, he could get a visa and go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">When this happened, we could put through other Austrian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">There weren’t too many left, and get them visas, and then we could help the others to get visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">And the interesting thing was we began to work rather swiftly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">My thought was firstly we must get young people out because the young people are the future of any community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">Secondly, we must get all those people out who have relatives who will help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">That meant they would not be a charge on the voluntary agency’s funds, which really had to harness its money, and also it would give them back a normal life, and so these people began to move rather swiftly through the <span class="DLF">pipeline</span> , and it worked very well until the first Displaced Persons Act, American Displaced Persons Act of 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">This in a sense sounds like a mythical story, but I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and some members of the Displaced Persons Commission, I'll think of their names in a moment — Carrousi (ph) and some other people, came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , I think it was on a Saturday, maybe it was a Friday, and said, ““We’re ready to issue visas under the Displaced Persons Act. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">Where are your job and housing assurances? </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">On the basis of those, we can give visas.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">Frankly, I’d never seen a job and housing assurance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">I didn’t know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">I knew we were going to have some, but we were waiting for our American agency to send the stuff over, and I said to these men, “Our job and housing assurances are at the printers, at the Allianz gebaude,” which 1s the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> where we took all our mimeographing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">If you would write one out for me, Ill go over there and get it mimeographed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">I was lying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">I’d never seen one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">They were very nice, these gentlemen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">They wrote it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">I went over to the Allianz gebaude. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">I mimeographed about 50. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">I had all the cases which I knew were okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">I issued a job and housing assurance for, and these went to the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> and these people gave them visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">I called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and told the director of immigration there what I had done and what the wording was on this thing so when these men eventually got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salz</span> — I beg your pardon — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> in a few days, they were ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">Now, our people began to get visas, and I must say within about ten days a cable came through to the director of the Joint in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , Harold Trobe, telling him that was Amy Zahl was doing was illegal and please stop her at once. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">And he called me on the phone and told me this, and so I went to the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> , I picked up every Jewish case I could find whether we would have been working with them or not, issued them job and housing assurances, and then stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">Now, what happened was as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> began to take passengers to the States, and we were using army transports, there were a lot of Jews in the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> — <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> , about four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army transports</span> , there were a lot of Jews in the first ship — ship, one ship, two ships, about four ships, and the press in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , of course, “Only Jews are getting visas.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">There were lots of anti-Semitic comments in the press, and I’m sure if you look at the press at that time, you'll find 1t was only because we were on the ball. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">What we did do, of course, was tell the other agencies what they needed and how to go about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">We didn’t have a counsel of voluntary agencies in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">We did when I got to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but that was very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">I felt as though I was doing sort of some really dirty work, but we were helping people to get out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1076">QUESTION:  Can you explain what a job and housing assurance is?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1077">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">In order to get a visa, you no longer needed an affidavit from an individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">What you needed was instead an assurance that you would have a job when you got to the United States and that you would have <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and that you would have housing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">And voluntary agencies were allowed to give these out because ostensibly, the voluntary agencies in the United States were going into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> were going into communities and asking them, and they were very good for all displaced persons, Jewish and non-Jewish, to give job and housing assurances which they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">The Jewish and all the other <span class="BUILDING">agencies</span> were very cooperative, and many displaced persons did get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> on the basis of those job and housing assurances.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1082">QUESTION:  Amy, was the assurance of a particular job?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1083">ANSWER:  A particular job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1084">QUESTION:  For this particular person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1085">ANSWER:  For this particular person in a particular <span class="NPIP">spot</span> in the United States, in a particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , in a particular town.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1086">QUESTION:  So, then, how did you do it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1087">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">If, Ivan Schwartz came to me, and he had met the other provisions of the Truman Directive was — which were that you had to have been in the American, British or French zones of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or the British, French or American zones of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> on December the 22"", 1945, you were eligible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">If you were eligible, we could get a job — we would contact the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and we would get — this is under normal circumstances — a job and housing assurance for Ivan Schwartz to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> to be a tailor, which he had been before, and on the basis of that, providing he passed his medical with the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> , providing he passed his security with the CIC, the Counter Intelligence Corp, he would get a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">Those were the only people who were eligible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">So, what I did, since I had job and housing assurances already for people, I just had to sign a name to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">In a sense, I did it without authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1093">QUESTION:  And did you do it thinking this person could do this job?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1094">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1095">QUESTION:  You just did it to -</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I had no idea what job they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">I wanted to get these people out, and it worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1097">QUESTION:  Were these mainly men?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1098">ANSWER:  Families.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1099">QUESTION:  Families?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1100">ANSWER:  Oh, it was families and individuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">It was whoever was eligible under the provisions of the directive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1102">QUESTION:  But you know why I’m asking? </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">Because are these jobs that are assured mainly jobs for men?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1104">ANSWER:  Mostly, I would think they were jobs for men because women weren’t a large part of the labor force in ’45. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">They were a very small part of the labor force except in <span class="BUILDING">munitions factories</span> and things like that, but in Europe women hadn’t been part of the labor force before the war, and we’re talking of people who hadn’t worked since the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1106">QUESTION:  And may not have finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ...</p>
<p>ANSWER:  May not have finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1107">QUESTION:  Was this and added burden for women then, unless they got married and were part of a family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1108">ANSWER:  We didn’t — I don’t seem to remember many individual women, and maybe as many women didn’t survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">I don’t remember as many women alone coming and trying to get out under the Displaced Persons Act. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">That’s a fascinating question because, when I think, I always think of families or husband and wives or single men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">I don’t remember many single women.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1112">QUESTION:  Because one might wonder whether some of the women married sooner than they might have, knowing that they might be able to get out if they were married, but not if they were single.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1113">ANSWER:  Right, and by the same token, some of the men might have married women they might not otherwise have married because they were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , let’s say, where the quota was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">They were still working on the quota system, remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">So, people married each other for different reasons, apart from the fact that they were fond of each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1116">QUESTION:  So, how long did you work in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1117">ANSWER:  I worked in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> from August ’46 to October 48.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1118">QUESTION:  That’s a long period. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">Could you describe, I mean, you were doing these visas, were you going around and explaining to people how they could get visas?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1120">ANSWER:  Yes, I used to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and explain what the law was, how they could become eligible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">I had <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Innsbruck</span> , and I would call these people together who run the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">So, we all ran on the same system. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">It was a tiring job ina way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">You had to be on the ball all the time, and you had to have good people, but the system worked very well, and then, when in 1948, the Displaced Persons Act was passed, I was asked, again, by Dr. Schwartz to go into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1125">QUESTION:  I don’t want you to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> so fast.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1126">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1127">QUESTION:  I want to talk about <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">What was it like to — did you lecture? </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">I mean, did you get into a <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> and lecture to a group of DPs to say this is what you-</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, I learned German very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">I learned it because I didn’t trust interpreters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">I didn’t know if they were working for the Russians or for the French or for the British or for the Americans, trying to catch me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">You learned to be very wary living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">For example, we couldn’t leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> without a propesk, a permit, from the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">I still have one as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">And what we, I would do when I was going up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> or to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , the other side of the Russian zone, I would get on — there was an American army train known as the Mozart, and we would get on that and that was not inspected by the Russians, but you still had to have a permit to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> , I would get on — there was an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American army train</span> known as the Mozart, and we would get on that and that was not inspected by the Russians, but you still had to have a permit to leave Austria. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">What was the rest of your question?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1137">QUESTION:  I was asking whether you would get in front of a large group of DPs and lecture to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1138">ANSWER:  No, I’m sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">I would go up, let’s say, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , and talk to the people in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and then I’d go into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and talk to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">I learned Yiddish, also, and I learned to speak with a Polish accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">There’s a different accent if you’re a Russian Jew or Lithuanian Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">You have a softer accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">I would talk to them in German or in Yiddish about what they had to do, and why it was taking so long from their point of view, that there was no need to try and come, let’s say, to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , which some of them would try to do or to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">We didn’t have the staff to cope with large numbers, but what was happening and what we were doing and I think the fact that we kept them informed of what we were doing helped to stop any rioting that we might have had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">I don’t remember any rioting at all, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">We had people who would be very irate and come in and bang the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and make all kinds of threats, but I think it helped having <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> where, you may laugh at this, where we set up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> where they could sit and wait, because when I first came in, there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> for visitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">They lined up, and one by one they went in and stood by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">Well, this whole thing of dignity which I’d learned at a very early age. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">People — you don’t give them dignity by making them stand and you sit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">I remember, what we did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and I did it again in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">We got a great big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">urn</span> , and made coffee, and the nicest person I could find, usually a nice Hungarian boy, I would put in charge of the <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span> , and he’d offer people coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">They were unused to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">A lot of people wouldn’t drink our coffee because they were ultra-orthodox, but other people would, and we would have newspapers in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and as I told you, they’d go along the <span class="DLF">walls</span> scribbling their names and where they were going to or leaving notes with somebody and they’d meet each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">It became a meeting place. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">It worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">It worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">Sometimes, they had to wait a long time in order to get seen because we didn’t have colossal staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">The work was tedious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">For the consuls, you had to have everything in order, and we weren’t only working on American immigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">We were working on immigration to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">No, we weren’t doing the Palestine immigration now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162"><span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> was being handled by the Jewish agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">We were not working on <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">That’s an error. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">We were working on South America, <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , New Zealand, <span class="COUNTRY">South</span> <span class="REGION">South America</span> , Canada, Australia, <span class="COUNTRY">New Zealand</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> , and the paperwork was very slow, but people did begin to move out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">But the Truman Directive was wonderful because, for the first time, numbers of people began to leave, numbers, and the <span class="BUILDING">Rothschild Hospital</span> , which was housing so many of these people, began gradually to get — to lessen in number its occupants. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">But it was hard work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1168">QUESTION:  Amy, in ’46, there are still people in DP camps who were not technically survivors, who had left the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> who were not technically survivors, who had left the country because of the war and they were accumulated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">Did you have criteria for who you would give visas to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1170">ANSWER:  We didn’t give visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">We were not judges. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">The people who in the DP camps, there were very few survivors of concentration camps — I’m thinking of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> , there were very few survivors of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> — I’m thinking of Vienna — no, there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">There were people who’d survived camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">No, we made no criteria. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">How can you decide that this need is greater than that need? </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">You know, because he has a new baby and these don’t have a baby and they’ ve both been through <span class="NPIP">hell</span> and only one of that couple had been through <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">No, no, no, you couldn’t afford to be judgmental. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">You couldn’t afford it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">But, as long as they met the criteria, and not a great number did, but a fair number met the criteria, we did everything we could to help them get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">The Immigration and Naturalization Service, I must say, were not very kindly disposed toward these people, and did everything they could to find some fault where they could deny them entry to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and then you would have to appeal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">This happened occasionally and somebody was absolutely heartbroken when you knew that they were genuine and they were refused entry by the INS having gone through all the medicals and all the other checks, and had been given visas and had written to relatives that they were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">They suddenly found that Immigration and Naturalization Services found their papers were not in order, let’s say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">Those were very hard times, very hard times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1184">QUESTION:  And would you appeal for them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1185">ANSWER:  We had somebody with legal experience who appealed to the INS, and very often we won our case, very often.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1186">QUESTION:  And what do you think the INS was doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">Were they being genuine? </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">Were they simply not wanting these folks to come in because they-?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1189">ANSWER:  Well, I remember one of the — I know — I remember the name of the man who was in charge of the INS in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">When he told Dorothea Green, who headed up the ORT, Organization for Rehabilitation and Training, who is a very lovely lady, very handsome, and she was fighting for a case, and he said to her, “Lady, you’re here to get these people in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">We’re here to keep them out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">And she didn’t lie. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">And I’m sure this was their attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">They didn’t like these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">After all, they didn’t speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">They weren’t well dressed by a long shot, and these men didn’t like them, and maybe they’d been given instructions to try and keep them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">No, that was pretty tough, but the — in the first instance, these people didn’t go to the INS until they got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">So, they were held back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">Later on, when the Displaced Persons Act came into being, they sent the INS into different <span class="REGION">regions</span> so people didn’t accumulate in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , but rather went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> knowing they were going to board a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1201">QUESTION:  Did you sometimes take the information? </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">Or were you sort of the administrative head of your staff?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1203">ANSWER:  What do you mean, did I take information?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1204">QUESTION:  Well, did you see with clients?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1205">ANSWER:  I was in charge of the administration, but I handled what I considered to be difficult cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">For example, if one of my workers said to me, “Amy, you know, I’m not sure that this man’s papers are really genuine.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">Because I must say, the Joint was very, very careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">It would’ve been foolish for us to sponsor cases of people whose documents were false, because we might have ruined for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">I would then take on that case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">Firstly, 1t was very time consuming, and there were plenty of people lined up, and I developed a means of questioning people where, if they could pass my surveillance, I would think that their papers were genuine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">If it became apparent to me that really these papers were false, I would say to this person, “You know, we can get you into <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> as either a furrier or a tailor or this or that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">So, you could — excuse me — you could meet your relatives in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">Or, if you would like to take your family to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , we’ ll try and get you there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">But, I would not sponsor that case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">That case became a no-no in our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">No, we were very careful in that sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1217">QUESTION:  Can you give me a sense of what it would mean to have a false paper? </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">What is that kind of documentation people had to have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1219">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">It was sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">These people had to prove that they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> on December the 22™, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">Now, some of them had gone back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to look for family and not found them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">So, on December the 22" 1945, they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> rather than in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they would make false papers to say they were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Germany town</span> on that date, so that they could pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">Now, it sound became apparent, for example, the Immigration and Naturalization Service would say to them, “What color were the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcars</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">because they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">And very soon, of course, the survivors knew what color the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcars</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">When you think back, it was horrid to treat people with such indignity, people who had suffered so much and who had gone to look for relatives and this was their crime because, because of that, they couldn’t get visas to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">It was horrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1229">QUESTION:  You must have gotten angry at times, no?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1230">ANSWER:  You couldn’t afford to be angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">You had to find ways to overcome this stupidity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">You got angry for your clients because you knew they were decent and fine people who perhaps been in concentration camp, or they’d be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koraganda</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> because they had fled to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and then come back, and they worked in the <span class="DLF">mines</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , or they’d be in Koraganda, in Russia because they had fled to Russia from Poland, and then come back, and they worked in the mines. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">They suffered, and here are these people treating them like gangsters because — criminals rather, because they hadn’t been in a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> on a certain date. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">They may have come over three days later, by the way, and that was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">That made you very sad, very sad because sometimes a mother would get a visa and her adult son wouldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">And then what we try and do 1s help the adult son get to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> because we knew that through <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , they could work something out where the two relatives could be joined again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">It was hard to watch.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1238">QUESTION:  Let’s take a break.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1239">ANSWER:  Excellent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">Don’t tell me an hour’s gone through again! </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">End of Tape #2 Tape #3</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Amy, give me some idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">You were in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> for a rather long time, close to two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1243">ANSWER:  More than two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1244">QUESTION:  More than two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">What was it like to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> during that time? </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">Did you meet with Austrians as well as the refugees and the survivors that you were helping?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1247">ANSWER:  We didn’t meet with Austrians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">It was a very difficult situation in the sense that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was occupied by the Americans, the French, the British and the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">Each had a <span class="REGION">sector</span> , and there was an <span class="REGION">international sector</span> , and one had to be very careful not to go into the <span class="REGION">Russian sector</span> at this time, because you could be arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">So, it was a bit difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">Also, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> had been bombed, and the only accommodation they had for people like us was in <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> and what were formerly known as studen (ph) hotels. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">Those were <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> where somebody came for an hour, and the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> were very tiny, and that, I found, very difficult to live with, and so I got myself a billet in a private <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of some Austrians and had at least a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> that I could move around in to myself, and it was a bit further out from the center. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">So, it was fairly pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">But they had no heating and I had to supply coal to heat my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">But it wasn’t bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">You know, I’d come from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , remember, not too long ago, and we didn’t have <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> to heat after the bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">So, that was okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1258">QUESTION:  And were these older Austrians?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1259">ANSWER:  No, these were younger people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">The husband had been a Nazi, but as he said, if he weren’t a member of the Nazi party, you couldn’t run a business, and I must say, I believed him also that he was a decent man because, when I was there, he was often sent packages from Jews who he’d help to get the Argentine, and they were sending him food packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">So, he couldn’t have been all bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1262">QUESTION:  Is that your main association with Austrian citizens?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1263">ANSWER:  I beg your pardon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1264">QUESTION:  Is that your main association with Austrian citizens?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1265">ANSWER:  With Austrian citizens, well, I had Austrians working in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , Austrian Jews, but I didn’t — I had very little contact or almost no contact with Austrians per se.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1266">QUESTION:  Did other members — actually, how many members of your staff were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1267">ANSWER:  In the <span class="BUILDING">immigration office</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">I had another person from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> who was my secretary and confidant, there was a man who originally had been from — had been Austrian, he now lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> , and he helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">And then there must have been eight other local staff, and they were Jewish, essentially because we wanted to give Jews employment, and so we were about a dozen people in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1270">QUESTION:  But, you had — you administered a number of <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1271">ANSWER:  Yes, this was the <span class="BUILDING">Viennese office</span> , which I worked in as well as administrating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">Then I administered the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> , the one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , which was the other side of the Russian zone, and the one in the French zone in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Innsbruck</span> , and then we had representatives in all the displaced persons camps because we would go out to them to save people having to travel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> , and the one in the <span class="REGION">French zone</span> in Innsbruck, and then we had representatives in all the displaced persons camps because we would go out to them to save people having to travel to Vienna, which they couldn’t do unless they had permits to go through the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camps</span> because we would go out to them to save people having to travel to Vienna, which they couldn’t do unless they had permits to go through the Russian zone, and that, nobody was keen to do at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">We would go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and tell them things which were necessary for them to know, or collect papers, or bring them papers for signature. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">It was a bit of an awkward program, although it worked very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">Or they could go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> , where there papers were held. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">It was not an easy situation actually because we were always worried that there might be Russians around trying to pick up people because sometimes we had Russian army officers who were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">For example, a woman came to me one day dressed almost in rags with dyed hair looking very ugly, and she said her husband and daughter were in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">She was a doctor in the Russian army, and there was a certificate for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> for her at the <span class="BUILDING">British consulate</span> , could we help her? </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">Well, the first thing you think 1s, “A ha! </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">She’s a spy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">She wants to see what we’re doing.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">And I took all her particulars and I went across to the <span class="BUILDING">British consulate</span> , and sure enough there was a certificate, but that wasn’t enough as far as I was concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">I contacted friends who were working with the Jewish agency for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , told them the story, and asked them to check in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> that she did indeed have a husband and a daughter there, because one never knew how honest these people were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">There were many ways by which you could trick somebody, and the answer eventually came back that yes, her husband and daughter were there and they confirmed her story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">Now, how was I to get her out? </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">She had to come at times when very few people were around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">I had to try and do everything so that she wouldn’t be seen, and eventually I got her certificate, and how to send her to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> which was in the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">And the only way to do it was to take her myself, and don’t think I wasn’t scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">I’m not so brave, but she sat in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with me and we handed in her papers, and my propesk, my permit to go into the Russian zone, and we put her on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> , and we put her on a plane. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">And there were others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">I had a young woman who was working at the Polish consulate, who had a brother in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> <span class="BUILDING">Polish consulate</span> , who had a brother in Canada. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">My goodness, my memory’s going back, and she said she had a visa to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , and again, I was suspicious, and checked her out in the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">I checked through the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> and then I checked with the agency, the Jewish agency working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , and they confirmed her story, and she told the Poles at that time she was going on vacation, and off she went to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">It was tricky doing this because you were always suspicious that perhaps these people were not genuine, and that you might be picked up yourself on the <span class="DLF">street</span> because people were being picked up, particularly by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">People would be walking along and suddenly a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> would stop, and like a gangster film, people would be whisked off and not seen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">It never happened to any of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">I’m just adding drama to the story, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1298">QUESTION:  Who were they picking up? </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">Who were they looking for?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1300">ANSWER:  I have no idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1301">QUESTION:  You don’t know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1302">ANSWER:  No idea, perhaps they were Russians who’d defected, could be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1303">QUESTION:  Now, this Russian woman who had been a doctor in the army, why did you have to bring her into your <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> when very few people were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1304">ANSWER:  I didn’t want her to be seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">Maybe I was scared, but I thought the less people who knew of her or who saw her, the better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">I remember her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">Her name was Hasia Rapaport, and I remember it very distinctly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1308">QUESTION:  Did you ever meet her later on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1309">ANSWER:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1310">QUESTION:  Were you also nervous that people who would see her might denounce her to somebody? </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">I mean, that there was-</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, they couldn’t because they didn’t — she liked look any other poor person in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">She had dyed red hair, and very — dressed very ordinarily, and heaven knows where she got her clothes from. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">She wasn’t in uniform when she came to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">She was too sensible for that, and she had guts actually to come to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , but her story was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">And I remember the Polish person, and often when we go to — out in the evening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , we would meet Russian officers who were Jews in the Russian army who were not going to defect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">They were Russians, but when you had a husband and a daughter in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , of course, you were going to defect if you could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1317">QUESTION:  How did the husband and the daughter get to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">Do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1319">ANSWER:  They must have gone when war started, or before war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">I didn’t ask her that question, but they probably went — that’s right, they couldn’t have gone legally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">They must have gone the long way around — the land route as we call it, go through <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> <span class="DLF">land route</span> as we call it, go through Siberia, and then make their way down.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1323">QUESTION:  Did you ever have a circumstance where the story was really not true and you had to say no to somebody?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1324">ANSWER:  No, I don’t remember such a story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">I don’t think they would’ve had the guts to come to us because they didn’t know how we respond, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">They may have been — we had Germans who tried to pass themselves off as displaced persons, as Jews, in order to get to the United States, and sometimes somebody, let’s say, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and sometimes somebody, let’s say, at Bremen when they’d pass and they had their visa, would recognize them as having been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , had been one of the workers there, and of course they had to be imprisoned for their own safety, but we discovered very early on that when a German held up his arms, his blood group number was tattooed under his arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">So, if we were suspicious, we could ask the doctor or somebody to examine him, but I’m sure Germans got through as Jewish displaced persons and probably lived a life as Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">People try all kinds of things and get away with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1329">QUESTION:  Are there any other situations in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> you would like to tell us about before we move to your next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1330">ANSWER:  Well, some of the things we did in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , we had to use our wits. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">I think that’s essentially the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">For example, I don’t know if I had told you earlier about the people who had visas for <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1333">QUESTION:  No, tell us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1334">ANSWER:  And I knew that their relatives actually were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Para</span> —I beg your pardon in the Argentine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">Well, obviously, the Argentine at that time was not giving visas to Jews, and so the relatives over there were sensible or smart, they got visas for <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> and we would get transit visas for the Argentine that one could get, and when they got to the Argentine, they had ways of whisking them off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">So, I remember I would sometimes have to go up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> because that’s where the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> was, and I remember having a large family of about 13 people — Schmuck Lieberman and another name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">I don’t remember them now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">And I went into the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> , and they weren’t very ready to give visas because they consuls made their living, in a way, from the visa fees they charged. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">You know, they were honorary consuls; they weren’t civil servants. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">And so I would go in and very brazenly say, “Of course, I know your secretary will have to work extra time, and if there’s anything we could do to compensate for that we would be very happy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">My way of offering a bribe, which was gladly accepted, and I would get these visas, and very discreetly in an envelope leave my payment and walk out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">But, you see, people who hadn’t been used to having to — what’s the word? — </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">find their way, wouldn’t do this kind of thing, and I remember the very nice woman who was running the <span class="BUILDING">Prague office</span> for the American Joint was astounded that I could come to her within one day and show her that I had 13 visas. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1344">You must have paid,” she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">I said, “Who would dream of paying?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">You couldn’t even tell your own what you were doing because if they didn’t know themselves how to do it, you could never teach them how.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1347">QUESTION:  How do you think you picked this up? </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">Knowing how to arrange things, because you’re right, people say, “I don’t pay for things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">I don’t barter for things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">I simply do-”</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, you had to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">I think you knew you had to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">You had to get these visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">You had to get these people out, and if you couldn’t do it by being honest, since the Argentineans weren’t offering visas, you had to do it dishonestly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">I didn’t think I was doing anything dishonest because I was helping people to join relatives, and you thought of a thousand ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">How did people survive who didn’t land in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , if they didn’t think of a thousand ruses to survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">And I suppose this is part of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1357">QUESTION:  So, but there is a difference because you said a number of times that you didn’t want to do anything that was illegal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1358">ANSWER:  Not if I could help it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1359">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1360">ANSWER:  But, when I had to get visas for the Argentine, transit visas, and I knew that the only way to get them was for the relatives to get the Paraguayan visas, there was no problem, and if I knew, as I did, that the consul was not anxious even to give transit visas to Jews, then you had to get them by other means. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">I mean, look at the people who landed up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , before and during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">They had no more intention of staying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> then you or I would have had, but this was their way of getting out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1363">QUESTION:  How did you distinguish between what was illegal and what was just sort of pushing the envelope?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1364">ANSWER:  I never even thought about what was legal or illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">I did everything to my knowledge legally, but when I had to help families get to a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that didn’t want them, but I knew they relatives could help them to stay there, and the general community wasn’t against them coming in, why not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1366">QUESTION:  Amy, when you took this job — actually, did you start to get paid at any point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1367">ANSWER:  Yes, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">After three years, Dr. Schwartz asked me if I’d like to come on to the American Joint’s payroll, and I said I thought that would be nice because by then I mean, I was very broke. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">I had no money, and he offered me a salary at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">It wasn’t very high, but it was much more than I’d been getting as a volunteer, and I felt, “Well, three years of voluntary service, I had paid my way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1371">QUESTION:  So, does that mean, was it ’46 or ’47?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1372">ANSWER:  This was in forty — toward the end of ’46, I came on to the JDC payroll.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1373">QUESTION:  That was nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1374">ANSWER:  No, I had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">I had no money.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1376">QUESTION:  But let me ask you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">You were in 1945, 26?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1378">ANSWER:  No, no, 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1379">QUESTION:  Twenty-five years old, and you had this job of bringing-</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Helping people to-</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Helping people to get-</p>
<p>ANSWER:  To the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1380">QUESTION:  Did you think about yourself at this very young person doing this wonderful-?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1381">ANSWER:  No, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">I take it for granted that I could do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">I didn’t even think of it as — I didn’t think that I took it for granted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">This was a job, and this was something I could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">I knew that I had administrative ability. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">I knew that I knew how to work with people, and — but I never thought of myself as doing anything special. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">I was always very pleased, for example, when I could do something like I did for these people going to <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> ostensibly and get their visas, because I helped them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">I’ve got pictures at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of them at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">I took them to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">We always gave flowers when people left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">That was quite European. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">You always presented people with flowers when they left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1393">QUESTION:  Was that your idea?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1394">ANSWER:  No, no, no, this was generally done, and I’ve got, you know, the father with the beard, and they would have many kids with them, and I’m sure many of those children were not their own, but how could you prove it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">They had no original documents with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">They probably were children of relatives, and why should I ask questions? </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">We were saving young lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">It was something one took for granted, one did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">During the war, the kinds of things we did in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> , you never thought of yourself as being anything special. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">You just did it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1401">QUESTION:  Were there other people — were most of the people working for you your age? </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">Were they much older? </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">Were they younger?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1404">ANSWER:  Some were older. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">Some were younger.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1406">QUESTION:  So, it was mixed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1407">ANSWER:  Mixed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">Some of the men were older, quite a bit older, but it’s interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">I never thought of age in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">I never thought that somebody was older or younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">Occasionally, you would find you came into an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> like when I came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and there was a man working there much older than I who was very entrepreneurial, and I didn’t trust him any further than I could throw a grand <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> , and I knew I had to get rid of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">And it took a little time, but very graciously, we paid him off and got him out because he was dishonest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">He was taking money from people to get them visas, and that, to me, was anathema. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">So, I won’t tell you his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">I remember it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1416">QUESTION:  You do, but you won’t tell right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">So, what happened in 1948? </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">You then got -</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Oh, in 1948, this was an interesting year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">The Americans passed the Displaced Persons Act, the first one where displaced persons if they had job and housing assurances, could get visas for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">It didn’t depend on which <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> they had lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">In other words, it wasn’t a quota system. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">And this was fascinating because, one day, I don’t know if it was a Friday or a Saturday, we were in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> — I must say we didn’t know whether it was Monday or Tuesday or Saturday or Sunday when we worked — Mr. Gruzo and Henry Rosenfeld and some others from the Displaced Persons Commission in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> appeared in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , charming gentleman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">They were ready to issue visas under the Displaced Persons Act. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">Well, I assure you that none of the voluntary agency personnel of all the <span class="BUILDING">agencies</span> knew the first thing about what we were supposed to have had, but they were ready to issue visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">And so, I said to them, “Unfortunately, my job and housing assurances are at the printers, but if you’d write one out for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">I'll take it over to the allianz gebaude,” which was the <span class="BUILDING">American building</span> where they had mimeograph machines, “Ill get some printed out, and you can start work.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">And so they were very nice gentlemen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">They wrote it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">I took it over, and came back with 50 or 60, and we took the cases in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and everyone they thought was eligible, I gave a job and housing assurance to, and pumps!, </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">a few days later they were issuing the visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">The next day, or perhaps that evening, I called our Munich office of the American Joint and told the man who was director there what we were doing and gave him the wording so that when these people arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> <span class="BUILDING">Munich office</span> of the American Joint and told the man who was director there what we were doing and gave him the wording so that when these people arrived in Munich, they would be ready, and quite a number of people got visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">In about ten days, a message came through from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> from the United Service for New Americans, which was our cooperating agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">They contacted all the communities in the United States where there were relatives and actually arranged the immigration of relatives to relatives or of people without relatives to people who were offering them jobs and <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> where there were relatives and actually arranged the immigration of relatives to relatives or of people without relatives to people who were offering them jobs and housing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">They were very efficient. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">But they cabled our <span class="BUILDING">Paris office</span> saying, “What Amy Zahl is doing is illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">Tell her to stop immediately.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">And Harold Trobe who was director of the joint operation in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> called me and said, “Amy, I’ve had this cable.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">And I said, “Hmm, very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">We will stop.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">And, of course, what I did, I went into the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> where they were very cooperative, let me put it that way, it was a very nice consul. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">Sometimes the consuls were not at all cooperative. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">In times when life was a stake before the war, the consuls were not very cooperative, but these people were very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">I looked through all the Jewish cases I could find whether they were registered with the Joint Distribution Committee or with HIAS (ph), or not registered with an agency, and gave them all job and housing assurances, and then I stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">Now, what happened as a result was these people got visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">They were sent up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , and they were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> going to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> in larger numbers than non-Jews sponsored by non-Jewish agencies because they hadn’t had this first encounter with the Displaced Persons Commission, and the press in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> was rather anti-Semitic, you know, “only Jews are getting visas.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">You can look up the press at the time and see these notices. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">What we did, of course, was to tell the Christian agencies what we had done, told them what the wording was so they could get started, but I think we had more support from our agency than they had from theirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">I know when it came to children, for example, I was always horrified both when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and later in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to find children — and, when I say children, I mean youngsters under 18 — still either in <span class="BUILDING">hostels</span> or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">Although the American — I’ve got the name of the agency, the refugee agency taking care of orphans — was working, they were working very slowly, and I just couldn’t bear the thought that there were kids without families still sitting in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and this is what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">18 months after the war ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">And so, what we would do is take these children and take them away from the other agency, and get them visas to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">It was exciting in that you thought you were helping people, and because we could work so efficiently, we saw the results in a very short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">When I finished the first batch in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , Dr. Schwartz came to me again in the October of 46, and said would I go into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and take over the operation there? </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">With working very successfully in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and I had very good assistance working in the <span class="BUILDING">Vienna office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">Everybody was strained. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">I always worked as though I was leaving tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">It was a good way to work because it meant if I wanted to take time off, the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> would function, the files would be working, and I felt that none of us should try to make ourselves indispensable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">We, after all, were working to save people’s lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">I always felt that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">And so, on October the 28", 1948, I came up into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , which was the head office for the German operation, and there was chaos. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">The staff there were on strike. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">About 200 letters a day were coming in from the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> because the American operations, as I mentioned earlier, were very efficient, and there was nobody working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">They were on strike. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">They wanted better pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">I was horrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">I came into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and a young woman, an American, Gladys Roth, was running the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> at that time, and I wanted her to take over the volkcaserna (ph), where people went in order to get processed for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">She was a very efficient worker, very sympathetic, spoke excellent Hungarian, spoke some German, and was a good worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">She too felt you had to help these people to get out — a wonderful sense of humor, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">She was a lifesaver. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">And I called these people together who were on strike, and I said I would look into their salary claims, but not unless they came back to work because what they were doing was stopping people leaving and they themselves were being stopped from leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">So, this doesn’t make sense to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">And I said, “Ill expect you all in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> tomorrow morning.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in the morning and there was some staff, and the next morning there were a few more, and I let word out that if the rest didn’t come back to work by the end of the week I was going to employ new people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">They were all back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">There were some troublemakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">For example, the way they had been operating was if people had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to pick up transit visas, they would hire <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coaches</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and two of the boys who worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> would go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">Well, you know what this leaves them open to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">They could take cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">They could do bribes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">I don’t know what they did, but I knew this had to stop, and I let it go on for a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">You don’t change things immediately, and one day I said, “You know, we have to let these people really go out on their own so that they face the world for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">So, let’s try one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> without you on it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">Well, no, they found a thousand reasons, but I was very firm and the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went off, and was successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">And then I announced that no more would we have to accompany these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">That was my way of handling that, and then in December, they decided to go on strike again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">I was 1n trouble because I didn’t know what I could offer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">Sam Haber was running the operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">He was a tough guy to cope with, and I said I would see them the next day, and talk to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">I came to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and there was not a soul 1n sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">And I felt, “I have failed.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">I was so horrified, and what could I do, and my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> was on the third floor of this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and I went up to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> of this building, and I went up to the office and I opened the door and there was a great big shout, “Happy Birthday!” </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">I had forgotten it was my birthday, and they were all up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">I wept. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">I was so astounded to find them all there, and friends, obviously they were now my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">I’ve still got the birthday card they made me out of a manila folder, that big and they’d all signed it, and that was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">From then on, we got along very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">The men who had accompanied the people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , I helped to immigrate very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">I thought that was the best thing for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">And I tried not to employ people who would have to immigrate now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">The Czechs — you may not know this historically, you may know it better than I — had thrown out the volksdeutsch, and there were some lovely young people amongst those who came into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who, through no fault of their own, were thrown out as revenge, and I employed some of these girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">I made sure they hadn’t been members of the BDM, the Bund Deutscher Mddel, and by the way, it was easy to check it because the Germans were so methodical, they had lists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">So, I employed these people, but then the rabbis were insulted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">I was employing non-Jews when Jews needed jobs, and I met with them, and I said, “My job is to get the Jews out of here who don’t belong here, and the only way I can do that is to employ non-Jews who are clean and let the others get out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">Some of these girls married Jewish boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">They were lovely girls, and they worked very efficiently, but these were some of the hurdles one had to cope with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">The rabbis were always watching that we did the right thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">For example, I had permission to send what we called “highly pregnant women”, women in their eighth month, by <span class="DLF">air</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> because if they couldn’t leave and they had babies, they couldn’t go on these cargo — not cargo, these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military ships</span> and the visa might expire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">It was only good for four months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">I had an arrangement with Air France. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">For every ten people I put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , I got one free <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">And so these women would come to me, you know, “I’m in my ninth month.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1512">I’m in my eighth month.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">And I got to the stage when I could look at a woman, and say, “You’re seven and a half months pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">You have time.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">It was very funny because we played jokes together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">I’m just remembering this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">We sent a lot of people by <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">Now, some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> sailed on a Saturday and the Orthodox Jews would not sail on Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">Some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> went on Friday evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">We made arrangements with the captains of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> and the captains of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , the passengers were allowed to embark before the Sabbath came in, therefore it was their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">They were allowed to get onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> the day before the Sabbath, so that this already was their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and there was no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">But, you had to think of all kinds of things to stop people from staying behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">Occasionally, you’d have somebody who was having a pair of trousers made, and therefore he couldn’t leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">It wasn’t that he was having trousers made. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">In a sense, a lot of these people were scared to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">I think that’s what I thought about them, and so I would call his tailor and if he was having trousers made, I used to tell him, ““You have to have them by tonight because otherwise he’s going to lose his visa.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">The tailors were usually pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">They were either displaced pers- mostly displaced persons or Germans, and they knew what was happening and they would finish the pants, and these people would go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">I only once met a man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> when I was there who at some kind of gathering, he looked at me and said, “Zie haben mae swandon heir sukammen.” (</span><span class="sentence" id="1531">ph) He was a German Jew who said I forced him to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and his wife said, “Ignore him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">But, he was a man who was having pants made. </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">It was fascinating working with those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">People had all kinds of excuses for not going, and I really felt they were scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">After all, some of them were coming to relatives they haven’t seen since before the war or they had never seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">A mother’s relative who had come a generation ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">I can understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">I would be horrified to have to go to a relative who was going to support me who I didn’t know, or my mother had told me stories they didn’t like. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">It was fascinating, fascinating, but you had to get — firstly, you had to get these people out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">They were not wanted in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">There was no future for them in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">And secondly, one knew that once they got to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , they could begin to rebuild for themselves and the new children they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">It was fortunate that so many of them did have children because this gave them a future. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">They were concerned for their children, and that was one of the reasons for leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">We also had situations where non-Jews had helped Jews in hiding, and I remember Andre Bulova’s sister, Bulova watch company, his sister was a Mrs. Godem (ph) came to see me, and for some reason, she liked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">She said, “Do you have people you would like to help and you can’t.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">I said, “Yes, P’ve got heads of families who are non-Jews.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">And we essentially helped families where the head of the family was a Jew because they would fit into a new community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">She said, “I will give you affidavits worth a million dollars each, and you send them to my brother and we will find jobs for them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">And there was one man who had hidden his wife through the war, and he did beautiful work, enamel on silver, and he brought in several — I shall never forget this — several small dishes in a way to show me of work he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">It was all very beautiful, and when I told Mrs. Godem, because she would come back and forth, she said, ““He can do watch covers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">My brother would be very pleased to see him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">And this man said to me, “Which one do you like the best?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">Well, I knew he was saying to me, “I will give you that one.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">I said, “They’re all beautiful.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">I wouldn’t admire any, and the only gift I ever have or had from a survivor or from a refugee was a dish he sent to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">He knew I wouldn’t take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">We allowed them to bring flowers to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and sometimes it looked like a <span class="BUILDING">mortuary</span> , there were so many flowers, but gifts were forbidden because gifts lead to bribes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">But I have at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> still this lovely tray he gave me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">It’s a dish about six inches in diameter, St. George and the Dragon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">I think he must have made it for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">And, they did very well in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">We had some wonderful people, we really did, who immigrated to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is richer for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">It really is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">The operation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> went quite successfully, I would say, because we got all the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> to work in the same fashion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">We set up some of the filing systems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">When we had people from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> who came into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , we had the same system for handing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">There was one case of a young man who I sent ostensibly to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> via <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">His name was Miklaus Rezmowitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">He was Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">I had found him on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and what I did, I got the Joint office to set up a small <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> for me where if I put kids there, they had a whole sheet to themselves on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and I tried to find them jobs, and I tried to get them out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> <span class="BUILDING">Joint office</span> to set up a small hostel for me where if I put kids there, they had a whole sheet to themselves on the bed, and I tried to find them jobs, and I tried to get them out of the country as soon as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">And I sent Mickey through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">When I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> 18 months later, somebody told me — because there always was a grapevine — that Mickey was working in a <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and I was horrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">This sweet little boy, to me he was a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">And I got him to come to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and he told me when he got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , for some reason something happened and the visa wasn’t picked up and nobody helped him, and he didn’t want to write and tell me because I’d been so kind to him, and so he let his visa lapse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">Well, I started immediately to work on his visa, and discovered he had a brother in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">I may have mentioned to you that even to this day, people are finding relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">His brother had escaped to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and was there, and I decided when I eventually got Mickey’s visa, I would bring the brother in from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">Eventually, we got a visa for Mickey, and I got his brother to come and we put him up in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> — I was sharing an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with three, two other girls, and the next morning we brought the brother to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> — I’ve got pictures of him — and where was Mickey? </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">He was no where to be found. </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">He was out philandering somewhere, and when I brought him to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and he met his brother for the first time since they were both taken away, you can imagine the scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">It was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">I then met Mickey again in New York, and he told me he was so appreciative of what <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and he told me he was so appreciative of what America did for him, he was joining the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">It was the Korean war, and I’ve never heard from him since. </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">So, I’m going to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> tomorrow to see if I, hopefully, don’t find him on the list that I should look at. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">But there were some wonderful stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">As I say, ve got pictures of these two brothers in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1588">There were some wonderful stories, and the older men I employed in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , some of them had come back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , took care of these youngsters for me, and behaved like fathers, you know, made sure they were in on time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">It just was a very nice atmosphere in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and made it easy to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1590">QUESTION:  Was this a much bigger operation that you had in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1591">ANSWER:  A much, much bigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">Most of the displaced persons in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were in the American zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> <span class="REGION">American zone</span> of Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">It was a much bigger operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">I can tell you some interesting stories of things that happened because people think the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were liberated and suddenly there were no more camps, but there were the displaced persons camps, and let’s say people wanted to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> but there were the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camps</span> , and let’s say people wanted to get to Canada, but how? </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">They were ineligible for the United States because they didn’t fit in with the criterion which was necessary to immigrate to the United States, and <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because they didn’t fit in with the criterion which was necessary to immigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and Canada would be offering a scheme to bring in tailors, or furriers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">Well, the ORT organization was wonderful in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">We got doctors and lawyers to train as furriers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">They could operate the same machines and they passed the exam, and came to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , and they worked as doctors and as lawyers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1599">They took their exams again, and they were of benefit to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1600"><span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> was foolish in many instances because they were looking for brawn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1601">They weren’t looking for brain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1602"><span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was much more aware of what was available because of the kinds of refugees they had taken in at the beginning or before the war, and so <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> got all kinds, but <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> took a long time to wake up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1603">But what we would do again — we wanted it to help these people get out and if all they were taken was furriers, well you train these people as furriers, and they came to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1604">I don’t think the consuls knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">I’m sure that the people in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> knew what we were doing, but you know, you’d get out 25 families at a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1606">It was wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1607">QUESTION:  So, who would do this training? </span><span class="sentence" id="1608">Did you say to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> personnel, “In order to get this people out, train them as such and such”? </span><span class="sentence" id="1609">How would that work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1610">ANSWER:  Okay, good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1611">If we heard, because we all were constantly being fed information that the Canadian government was looking for 50 furriers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1612">We would pass word to the representative of the Joint in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that the Canadians were looking for 50 furriers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1613">He knew through discussion with us that what these people had to be able to show the representatives of the government was that they knew how to operate the sewing machine that took fur, that they knew how to cut fur, or they knew how to stitch, and by golly, the ORT representative in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machine</span> that took fur, that they knew how to cut fur, or they knew how to stitch, and by golly, the ORT representative in the camp really showed them how. </span><span class="sentence" id="1614">They trained very quickly, and when they came for the exams, they passed perfectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1615">QUESTION:  So, how were these people chosen do you think? </span><span class="sentence" id="1616">Do you have any idea?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1617">ANSWER:  They volunteered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1618">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1619">ANSWER:  If a doctor was hoping that he could go somewhere and work as a doctor, but saw that it was useless, he’d go anywhere because he knew once he got to that new <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , he could take exams again and work in his profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="1620">People were not afraid to do the dirtiest menial work in order to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , number one, and secondly, they wanted to set up a new life and start life again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1621">So, they were very ready to do anything that they could do to get out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1622">QUESTION:  Now, was ORT the major or the only organization in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> training people or were there a number of different kinds?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1623">ANSWER:  In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camps</span> , and it was mainly ORT, I don’t know of another organization that was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">ORT trained people in mechanics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">They trained — they still work today, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1626">That organization was started in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , I think, after the First World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">It’s an extraordinary organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">It still works around the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">It was the ORT which had many, many <span class="BUILDING">training centers</span> set up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">They had good people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">Very often they were displaced persons who were experts in their <span class="DLF">field</span> training other displaced persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1632">They were very well organized and they did a beautiful job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1633">QUESTION:  Because a lot of the people who were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> were too young to have even gotten a profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">They had gone through their teenage years sometimes, late teenage years, and hadn’t finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1636">ANSWER:  People who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camps</span> , there were very few who were teenagers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1637">QUESTION:  No, but their teenage years may have been through the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1638">So, they may have lost their last couple of years of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1639">ANSWER:  They may have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1640">Yes, they may have been in their twenties. </span><span class="sentence" id="1641">They certainly had lost schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1642">They didn’t have formal education. </span><span class="sentence" id="1643">There weren’t too many individual young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1644">There weren’t too many families with children who were in their twenties. </span><span class="sentence" id="1645">Families were decimated, you have to remember, totally decimated, and if there — excuse me — if there were young people, they were individuals, and you’re quite right, they had lost their schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1646">They had no training. </span><span class="sentence" id="1647">Firstly, they hadn’t been to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1648">They hadn’t gone to <span class="BUILDING">technical school</span> , and they had no training in occupations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1649">ORT was a Godsend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1650">ORT was a Godsend to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1651">QUESTION:  Let me ask you something about the young women who were having babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1652">There was a letter written by Kaufman who was the head of the Jewish Agency for Palestine who apparently visited the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> , and wrote, whether rightly or wrongly, that these young women who were having babies don’t know how to be mothers, we have to send women here to train these young women because these babies are coming and they don’t know what to do or they don’t even want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1653">Did you find in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> where you were visiting that this was not an easy time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1654">ANSWER:  Well, first thing, we had social workers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1655">Secondly, this gentleman wasn’t aware, perhaps, that these young women had lost their mothers who normally would’ ve helped them through this period, and there were no older women around who’d had babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">They had been killed off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">But they soon learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1658">These women had mother’s instinct. </span><span class="sentence" id="1659">They were so thrilled to have babies, to start again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1660">The men who were their husbands, because there was no license there, there weren’t women who weren’t married having babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1661">These were young women who were married and having children, starting a life again, starting a family again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1662">They were very careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1663">I think they all cared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1664">Some of them probably were better than others, but even in our society, we have women who are better than others in rearing children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1665">But it was wonderful for us when they first started to get pregnant, because while they were incarcerated or in hiding, most women didn’t even menstruate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1666">They only started to menstruate again when they were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">It’s an interesting phenomenon how nature takes care of itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1668">QUESTION:  Do you know — do we know about how long it took for women to start menstruating again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1669">ANSWER:  Yes, I think it must have been more than a year, even up to two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1670">QUESTION:  That long?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1671">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1672">It was more than a year because I remember being in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when there was much rejoicing and we had to order from the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> these sanitary napkins for the women and condoms, by the way, because women were getting pregnant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1673">QUESTION:  So, there were not condoms in the beginning?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1674">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1675">QUESTION:  No, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1676">ANSWER:  Where would the condoms come from? </span><span class="sentence" id="1677">They were ordered, which was rather nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1678">You know, you — I had never thought of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1679">Who ever thinks of that kind of thing? </span><span class="sentence" id="1680">You know, a single girl brought up properly, but it was wonderful that they were even thinking about planning their families.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1681">QUESTION:  So, did they ask for condoms?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1682">ANSWER:  I would assume so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1683">They didn’t ask of me, and I didn’t officially know of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1684">I knew from the other people working in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that this was happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1685">QUESTION:  So, people were trying to be very careful knowing that-</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah, if they had one baby, they didn’t want another baby immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1686">After all, they were no grandparents who were going to rejoice in these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1687">There were no families that were going to help them bring up these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1688">They were going into a new world all on their own, and a lot of these people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> wanted to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1689">They did not want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1690">I’m talking before the State of Israel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1691">They very definitely wanted to go to the United States because a large percentage of them had family in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because a large percentage of them had family in the States, a large percentage, and I think they wanted to get away as far as they could from the Russians and away from Europe and the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1692">That was another factor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1693">And <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> still held out the dream for a lot of these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1694">QUESTION:  Was there — from what you remember as opposed to what you know from history — do you remember a tension between Zionists and non-Zionists, because clearly the Zionists wanted people to say they wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1695">ANSWER:  There was a lot of tension. </span><span class="sentence" id="1696">There was a lot of tension between the non-Zionists and the Zionists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1697">Some people were almost forced to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1698">I know I would give people letters to say they were registered with me for the United States so that they could not be forced onto a transport to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> so that they could not be forced onto a transport to Palestine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1699">Remember also, at this time, there was a lot of illegal immigration into <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and these people didn’t want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1700">They’d suffered enough from their point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="1701">They had not been Zionists because if their parents had been Zionists, they would have left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before the war and gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1702">When one thinks of it, very few Jews really were going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , where there was tremendous poverty, tremendous anti-Semitism, long before the Hitler regime, and they didn’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1703">It was a very difficult time for a lot of people, but it was a political situation and they were pushing these people to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1704">I was never in favor of it, I must say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1705">QUESTION:  Do you remember Ben-Gurion visiting the DP camps?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1706">ANSWER:  He came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1707">Yes, he came up into the <span class="REGION">British zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1708">I didn’t see him, but I remember that he came and in certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> where, for example, Yosele Rosensaft was heading the camp at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1709">Yosele who was getting everybody to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> except he. </span><span class="sentence" id="1710">He came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> with his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1711">Ben-Gurion was up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1712">What Ben-Gurion did arrange was that some of the children who had survived who the Zionists and Belsen would not allow to come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , Martin Gilbert has written a book about the boys, well these were some of the boys who might have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="1713">They were not allowing these kids to come but, Ben-Gurion spoke to Yosele and some others in the camp, and we did get a transport out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> of youngsters to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and these kids had sat there for so long, they were so ill so many of them because they wanted the men to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> because they didn’t like going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spevan</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and we did get a transport out of Belsen of youngsters to England, and these kids had sat there for so long, they were so ill so many of them because they wanted the men to go to Israel because they didn’t like going to Spevan (ph), and they didn’t like the British Government policy and so the kids suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1714">They were used as political pawns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1715">But Ben-Gurion, I must say, helped to ease that situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1716">QUESTION:  So, these people in obviously — the war ends and life is hard as always.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1717">ANSWER:  It resumes normally, politically among Jews who are Zionists and Jews who are not Zionists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1718">It resumes as it was before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1719">People don’t change, situations change.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1720">QUESTION:  Were people taught English or were they taught other languages when they were coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1721">ANSWER:  Yes, there were courses, and there were other courses run for people who were coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> or to English-speaking <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and numbers of refugees took advantage of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1722">Once they knew they were going to get a visa, they were very good about learning to speak the language.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1723">QUESTION:  Were there a lot of, or some, breakdowns of people who could not adjust to the loss of not having a family, even if they got married? </span><span class="sentence" id="1724">Did you notice it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1725">ANSWER:  Well, there were people who were depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1726">There were people who were depressed, very understandably, when you found you had a young man who had seen his parents and brothers taken off and some policeman or another had pushed him to the side because they had known each other on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and saved him and he found our none of his family had survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1727">A tremendous guilt feeling of being alive, and how do you help people to get over that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">Some people never did or never have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1729">I know people who survived who have never gotten over the fact that they are the sole survivors of their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">Sometimes they’ll find a person who lived in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> who went through a similar experience, and they are as close as brother and sister or brothers because they shared similar experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">People are still suffering, and that’s why I think, for many, many years, most of the people who survived the war were not able to tell their children of their experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">People say, “Well, why is it only now this is coming to light?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1733">It’s been very hard to talk about it, very hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1734">QUESTION:  So, why do you think now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1735">ANSWER:  Now, because time has passed and the children are asking the right question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1736">The children are adult enough to be kind to their parents in the sense that they will ask the question kindly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">The grandchildren ask the questions, and they’re gradually loosening up as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1738">Some people have been for counseling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1739">Some didn’t need the counseling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1740">Some needed to tell the story in order to ease their own souls, their own conscience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1741">People felt very guilty about remaining alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1742">QUESTION:  [Pause.] </span><span class="sentence" id="1743">How many people do you think you got out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , if you had to put numbers on that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1744">ANSWER:  Well, I would think that we helped about 40,000 to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and when you think that each one was an individual visa, nothing was en masse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1745">We worked seven days a week, all the hours that were given us, and we never thought of it at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1746">I used to skip out sometimes on a Sunday and go fishing, in fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1747">I love trout fishing, and once I got caught fishing in illegal waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1748">QUESTION:  Is that your one illegal act?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1749">ANSWER:  No, but a bottle of scotch handled that quite nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1750">We used to be able to buy scotch at seven and sixpence a bottle, which was just over a dollar.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1751">QUESTION:  Did you keep the trout and cook it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1752">ANSWER:  No, no, when we caught them, we threw them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1753">That wasn’t cricket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1754">You didn’t keep the trout. </span><span class="sentence" id="1755">You just caught it and threw it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1756">I didn’t fish to have fish to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1757">QUESTION:  You just fished for the-</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Sometimes we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1758">No, I’m telling the truth completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1759">Sometimes we did, but that’s right — the guy who drove us out — his mother used to clean them for us, because he used to fish also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1760">But I didn’t realize, actually, that we were fishing in illegal waters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1761">This man who was one of our drivers took us there, and he said, “This is where you can fish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1762">So, we fished until a policeman came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1763">And I was horrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="1764">You know, really, I’m the director of immigration of the American Joint Distribution Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1765">I was petrified also that I might be jailed, but my friend, Gladys Roth, had a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1766">She was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1767">She was a marvelous worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="1768">Unfortunately, she died a few years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1769">She would have had wonderful stories to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1770">She did a tremendous job and helped a tremendous number of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1771">We had some very fine people working with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1772">There was another woman who came up from <span class="COUNTRY">South</span> <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> , another volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1773"><span class="COUNTRY">South</span> <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> also had volunteers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1774">A woman called Hannah Kisch who worked in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> who did a beautiful job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1775">She was from <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> and spoke beautiful Yiddish, and people loved her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1776">She did a very good job, and despite the fact that she was rather an emotional woman, was able to forget this, and when she had to bawl somebody out because they’d done something that wasn’t good, she could do it in the kind of Yiddish that they understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1777">She was a lovely woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1778">We did have some wonderful women working with us, and some men, but mostly they were women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1779">They did a tremendous job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1780">QUESTION:  And what was the relationship between the <span class="REGION">zones</span> with respect to the work? </span><span class="sentence" id="1781">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , were you traveling between the <span class="REGION">zones</span> more easily?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1782">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, I didn’t — never went into the Russian zone, and I never went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> , and I never went into Berlin because I was told my name was on a list, and I didn’t know whether this was true or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1783">After all, I had helped Russians to immigrate, and I was playing safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1784">Also, I was scared, and so I never went into the Russian zone in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or never went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> in Germany or never went into Berlin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1785">To this day, I’ve not been to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1786">I hope to go soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1787">I’m hoping to find papers of the Reichsfertreitung, the Jewish community organization, when I get there because none some to have survived, and they did a fantastic job, but-</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So, you went into the <span class="REGION">French zone</span> and the <span class="REGION">British zone</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1788">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, constantly up and down, up and down.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1789">QUESTION:  And you were obviously sometimes doing work for those people, as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1790">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, and then I would take a group of people, let’s say down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genoa</span> to get on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and I would escort them to the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1791">The police were wonderful at the Brenna (ph) Pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="1792">The Italians got to know me, and they would tell me, “The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ’s going to be a half hour, three-quarters of an hour late. </span><span class="sentence" id="1793">Why don’t you go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and when we know the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ’s coming, we’ll wake you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1794">And, so I’d go to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , sometimes the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was an hour late, and somehow I'd hear the police shouting up at me or banging on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and I’d get up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1795">I had all the passports for these people, couldn’t give passports out, and I would accompany them down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genoa</span> , and the catabaneri (ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genoa</span> were very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1796">They’d invite me down to the <span class="DLF">docks</span> , make sure that I had somebody with me, and take me to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and make sure that I had my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a side doors locked, because many <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> had <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> adjoining with <span class="DLF">doors</span> that were unlocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1797">They always made sure that the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were locked before they would allow me into the <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1798">They were very nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1799">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genoa</span> maybe every three or four weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1800">There was a wonderful woman working for the Joint there called Elia Eliaskovitch her name was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1801">She had come to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to study Anthropology before the war, got stuck there, and the catabaneri gave her a certificate to say that she was a Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1802">She survived all through the war, Elka Eliaskovitch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1803">I lost touch with her, but she knew every consul in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genoa</span> , and she would just take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1804">We would get the visas that we needed and then she would take me down to the shipping agents because shipping was very difficult to get, and she would always manage to get shipping. </span><span class="sentence" id="1805">She was a wonderful woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1806">She landed up I think in <span class="REGION">California</span> , but I never heard from her after she left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1807">We did have some wonderful characters working in this total program.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1808">QUESTION:  So, you had to take all the passports together and put them en masse on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1809">ANSWER:  No, no, what I did was I was getting the visas for all these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1810">So, I needed all the passports together, and I couldn’t give them back to the people because I wanted them all together and to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1811">They only got their passports when they were getting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1812">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1813">Okay, we’re going to take another break.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  Amy, I wanted to give people a sense of what the 1948 DP Immigration Act brought as opposed to what the Truman Directive was in 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="1817">What was the difference? </span><span class="sentence" id="1818">I mean, what happened because of the Immigration Act?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1819">ANSWER:  Well, it was very different from the Truman Directive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1820">That gave the first ray of hope to people that they might get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but when they passed the DP Act, this was the first time, really, that people could come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> outside of a quota number and on the basis of a job and housing assurance which somebody perhaps they didn’t know had given them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1821">Whereas, before affidavits were generally given by close relatives who undertook, of course, to ensure that they would not be come a charge on public funds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1822">This was a totally different concept, and the Truman government at the time really is to be congratulated in having shown a humanitarian aspect of US immigration law which until then had really kept people out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1823">QUESTION:  So, this made a big different to your work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1824">ANSWER:  It made a tremendous difference because we could offer hope to many more people that they could get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1825">They didn’t have to have visas — I beg your pardon — they didn’t have to have affidavits from relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1826">Many of them didn’t have relatives who wanted to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1827">This also was important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1828">It meant that people were given a choice to an extent and how often had these people been given a choice after the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="1829">They came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or if they were Polish Jews who had fled into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and worked in the <span class="DLF">mines</span> , and had gone back to the <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , what choices had they had? </span><span class="sentence" id="1830">It might interest you, by the way, to know that among the people we took care of, the first complete Jewish families I found after the war were the Polish Jews who had fled to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> when the Germans marched in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1831">And, although they’d suffered tremendous hardship, we had husbands and wives and children together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1832">It was very interesting to see this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1833">As I said, they had — many of them had suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1834">They’d worked in the <span class="DLF">mines</span> , and when do Jews work in <span class="DLF">mines</span> , after all? </span><span class="sentence" id="1835">They were tradesmen or employees, but they did survive as families.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1836">QUESTION:  Was this a source of resentment with the Jews who had come out of-?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1837">ANSWER:  No, it wasn’t — people weren’t even aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="1838">People were concerned for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1839">You have to try and imagine what it was like to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the war when either you were a survivor of a camp — and there weren’t too many remember — you were somebody who had been encouraged to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp —</span> and there weren’t too many remember — you were somebody who had been encouraged to leave Poland, firstly because the Poles were still anti- Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1840">There had been pogroms in 1946 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> , when Jews were killed again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1841">You were encouraged to leave because you hoped for a better life somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1842">You didn’t want to be among the people you had been with, and everybody in a sense was concerned for himself or herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1843">And you have to imagine also in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> there was a total lack of privacy for people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1844">They were sleeping in nissen (ph) huts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1845">There was curtain in between families to give them some sort of privacy, but very little because it didn’t stop voices carrying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1846">It was a very difficult time for these people, and our feeling generally was the sooner we got them out of these — these people out of these conditions, the better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1847">It was a very, very tough time for these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1848">And although visitors who came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> — and there were many — and saw these people and they would talk very bravely, they didn’t see how these people were living, what kind of latrine facilities there were, what kind of washing facilities there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1849">There were no, obviously, there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">washing machines</span> , but what kind of laundry facilities there were, what kind of facilities there were for the Orthodox Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1850">It was an extraordinary difficult period, and these people survived it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1851">These are the people who were the survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1852">They were amazing people, and if there were occasionally arguments or quarrels, why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="1853">I mean, this too was normal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1854">QUESTION:  So, people who visited did not see the conditions in terms of which people-</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Oh, yes, they saw the conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1855">I’m thinking of people who visited who were interested, let’s say, in raising money in the United States, and they came through and they saw the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and they came through and they saw the camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="1856">They may have even spent as much as a half a day, but you can’t get a feel of a <span class="NPIP">place</span> from that kind of experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1857">QUESTION:  Do you remember Harrison coming through to write the report for Truman about the conditions in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1858">Were you in that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1859">ANSWER:  No, he came through, I think, before I came into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1860">I’m trying to think of which year it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1861">Was it ’49 that he came through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1862">QUESTION:  I’m trying to remember, but I can’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1863">ANSWER:  I didn’t meet him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1864">QUESTION:  There’s one person who came to get a visa named Oscar Schindler, can you describe the circumstances in terms of which he came to you, who came with him, how many times you met him, what you did for him, and what you thought of him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1865">ANSWER:  He was an interesting character. </span><span class="sentence" id="1866">Again, Dr. Joseph Schwartz, who was the European Director of the JDC, came to me and told me really a fantastic story of a man whom a whole group of survivors in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> had just given a banquet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1867">Who was this man? </span><span class="sentence" id="1868">His name was Oscar Schindler, and I really knew nothing about him at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1869">And Dr. Schwartz told me that Oscar Schindler had saved the lives of at least 1,200 Jews by having them work in his <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and Oscar Schindler had come back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1870">I think he had tried to set up a <span class="BUILDING">concrete factory</span> , and was not successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1871">It’s interesting, this fantastic character didn’t do very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1872">The Joint was helping to support him at this time because they were so astounded by his efforts to save people who essentially were not of his own kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1873">They were Jews; he was a Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1874">He was a member of the Nazi party, as most Germans were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1875">And the fact that he had helped these people, they were ready to do anything they could to help him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1876">So, Dr. Schwartz said to me, “Amy, you know the ropes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1877">He will come to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1878">Perhaps he won’t even come alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1879">He may come with other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1880">I want you to try and send him wherever he wants to go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1881">Well, Oscar Schindler appeared in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> one day with his wife and two young Jewish couples, and I sort of couldn’t get the hang of what the relationship was, and they explained to me in Yiddish that they always protected him because he looked like any other German Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1882">He had blue eyes and blonde hair, and was very fair, obviously, and they were afraid if he came to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , which was in the Jewish quarter of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , he might be set upon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1883">There were a lot of belligerent Jews at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1884">Oscar, as I said, came, and explained to me that what he really wanted to do was to set up a <span class="DLF">mink farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1885">Now, what he knew about mink farming, I had no idea, but 1t wasn’t mine to question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1886">And the place he wanted to do it was in the Argentine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1887">The Argentine, I knew the Argentine consuls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1888">I could get a visa for Oscar and his wife, no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1889">They were Catholics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1890">But, he said also, he would not go unless the two couples with him also got visas because they were like family to him, and they felt he was family to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1891">He’d saved their lives, and they were never going to forget this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1892">Well, I set about trying to get the visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1893">As I say, it was not too difficult for Oscar and his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1894">How to get visas for the two couples with him — on the application form for a Argentine visa, they asked religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1895">They did on many applications at that time, asked the religion of the applicant, but it didn’t say explain anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1896">It didn’t say, for example, if somebody was Orthodox, were they Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Jewish Orthodox, “A ha!” </span><span class="sentence" id="1897">I thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="1898">I put Orthodox, and it was no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1899">I got the visas, and eventually they went to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1900">I’m sorry, they went to the Argentine, but they were lovely people, all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1901">Oscar was very soft voiced, very pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1902">Who could imagine that this man — he was diminutive, he wasn’t very tall — had the courage to do the kinds of things he did? </span><span class="sentence" id="1903">I don’t know if you’ve seen the film “Schindler’s List’, but a lot of that — the story in that film — is true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1904">He was an extraordinary man to deal with, and in retrospect, quite a privilege to have met him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1905">It was interesting that we were so busy trying to help people that it never occurred to me that here was somebody who was very, very special.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1906">QUESTION:  Did you talk with his wife, as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1907">ANSWER:  Yes, she didn’t do much talking, but she also was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1908">She’s still alive, you know, living in the Argentine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1909">She was very pleasant, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1910">QUESTION:  Did he — did you talk to him at all about what he had done during the war, or not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1911">ANSWER:  No, you didn’t talk to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1912">I think, firstly, he might have been embarrassed, but that isn’t why he came to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1913">Firstly, it would not have occurred to me, except to tell him what a wonderful human being he was, but you know, we really had no concept at that time — this is 1949 — of the kinds of things that he had done to save so many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1914">I mean, he got people out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1915">Who ever got anybody out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1916">He was quite an extraordinary man.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1917">QUESTION:  Could you put together the man who was portrayed in the film and the man that you met in your <span class="BUILDING">office</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1918">ANSWER:  Yes, to an extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1919">I think there’s one part of the film where he goes into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> to get wine, I think, it is Gert’s <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and the young lady who works for him, a Jewish prisoner, who Gert is very nasty to, is down there and Oscar, if you remember the film, leans towards her and she thinks he’s going to kiss her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1920">And he pats her on the shoulder. </span><span class="sentence" id="1921">He said, “No, I wasn’t going to kiss you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1922">I was going to kiss you actually only on the forehead, but to tell you you will be all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1923">I will take care of you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1924">Now, when you think of this man, he could’ve abused this girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1925">He could’ve abused any of the Jewish women in his care. </span><span class="sentence" id="1926">He could’ve raped them if he had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1927">He could’ve done anything with them because they owed their lives to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1928">He didn’t touch one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1929">Although in the film, he is shown as being a womanizer, it helps to sell a film. </span><span class="sentence" id="1930">Let’s face it, and he may have been a womanizer, but the important thing about Oscar Schindler is he didn’t touch one of the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1931">I think this tells you essentially the character of this man.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1932">QUESTION:  So, how long did it take you to get him the visa? (</span><span class="sentence" id="1933">One second, please.) [</span><span class="sentence" id="1934">Microphone adjusted.] </span><span class="sentence" id="1935">How long did take you to get him out of <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1936">Or get him into <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> , I’m sorry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1937">ANSWER:  I think it took me about five or six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1938">There are all kinds of documents you have to fill in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1939">You have to get passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="1940">I had to get passports, take those passports for the people who were going with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1941">They were Polish Jews, and they weren’t going as Polish citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1942">It was all rather complicated, and yet in a sense it was very normal for us to be doing the kind of thing we were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1943">So, he came to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on several occasions, and was always very pleasant, an extraordinary man.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1944">QUESTION:  Could we stop the film for just one second? [</span><span class="sentence" id="1945">Tape break.] (</span><span class="sentence" id="1946">Okay, we’re rolling.) </span><span class="sentence" id="1947">Are there any other people whose stories you’d like to tell us that you helped? </span><span class="sentence" id="1948">That you haven’t told us about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1949">ANSWER:  There were some very wonderful survivors, but each story is a different story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1950">The fact that they were survivors, and remained decent human beings and people with a sense of humor, and people with kindness, there are many stories of many kind people, and there were people who survived who weren’t kind people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1951">I think people went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> — rather, people who went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> as kind, decent human beings came out as such, and those who were gas/lonim, gangsters, when they went in, were gangsters when they came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1952">People don’t change. </span><span class="sentence" id="1953">Their behavior changes, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1954">There was some very wonderful people who survived, and very wonderful people, unfortunately, who didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1955">QUESTION:  So, how — you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> doing this job until 1952.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1956">ANSWER:  I stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> until the Displaced Persons Act came to an end, and then I felt it was time for me to go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1957">The American Joint wanted me to go down to <span class="COUNTRY">Morocco</span> where they had a program, but I thought it was about time I started to sample normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1958">You have to remember that, since I was a teenager, I’d been working with displaced persons living an expatriate life, an exotic life in a way, but I felt that my biggest job had been done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1959">I’d helped as many people as I could to immigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1960">We didn’t handle <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1961">And it was about time I set myself up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1962">And, so, I waited until the Act came to an end in May of ’45, and then decided I would go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and see where some of these Americans with whom I’d work came from.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1963">QUESTION:  So, from 1944, February, until 1952, May, you hadn’t been back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> but once?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1964">ANSWER:  Oh, no, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1965">QUESTION:  Had you been back more?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1966">ANSWER:  Oh, I had been back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1967">If I got a weekend, while my mother was alive, I would pop over to see her as often as I could, which was perhaps every four months, six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1968">I’d take a long week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1969">You know, it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> overnight there, and spend a day with her, and come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1970">Maybe it was longer periods in between, but I did go and see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1971">My mother died in 1952, and I had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> about three months before, and we had gone to the ballet, and had a lovely evening, and that was my last memory of her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1972">QUESTION:  You were very close to your mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1973">ANSWER:  Yes, I liked her tremendously. </span><span class="sentence" id="1974">She was a very kind woman, a very kind woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1975">QUESTION:  Was she both proud of your work and yet missing you a great deal, wishing that you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> with her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1976">ANSWER:  Oh, I think she would have loved to have had me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , but she was very proud of the fact that, 1n a sense, I was giving service, 1s the way that she would put it, that I was helping other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1977">I think if she had been younger, she might have done it herself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1978">QUESTION:  What age did she die?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1979">ANSWER:  She was in her late 60s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1980">QUESTION:  So, she was not such an old woman?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1981">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1982">She’d been sick.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1983">QUESTION:  And your decision to go to the United States rather than <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> rather than England.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1984">ANSWER:  Well, I couldn’t see myself in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> having worked with the Americans for so long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1985">I needed a break, I felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1986">I had no <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , anyway, and I thought I would come to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1987">I had friends in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , Gladys Roth, with whom I had worked invited me also to come and stay with her while she was on leave, and so I thought that was a good idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1988">And, when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> I was invited by William Rosenwald, the son of Julius — was it Julius Rosenwald. </span><span class="sentence" id="1989">Or was that his brother who started Sears Roebuck? — </span><span class="sentence" id="1990">who had met me in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , asked me if I’d come and run his philanthropies for him, and I thought I would try that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1991">And I was working for him for about a year when the American Joint again approached me and said they had a problem down in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> where the last people who had been <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camps</span> , a lot of whom had been sent down there and they were having a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1992">Would I go down to <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> and sort the situation out? </span><span class="sentence" id="1993">Foolishly, I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1994">The Brazilian community that I dealt with, largely was the refugee community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1995">There were about 20,000 former refugees living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Paulo</span> , most of them very, very fine people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1996">The people who had been sent in when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camps</span> were closing were difficult people, let me put it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1997">Some of them were mentally ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="1998">Some of them should never have been sent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1999">Some of them had no desire to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2000">It was a very, very difficult situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="2001">I was physically attacked down there for a change. </span><span class="sentence" id="2002">I hadn’t been physically attacked since I’d been 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , and it was broadcast, by the way, over the radio and some friends, including Norman Bentwich, Professor Bentwich, heard in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , called my aunt, and I got frantic phone calls from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2003">I got another dislocation from that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2004">QUESTION:  How did they attack you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2005">ANSWER:  Physically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2006">QUESTION:  They just started beating you up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2007">ANSWER:  Well, they tried, yes, and you know, I’m rather small. </span><span class="sentence" id="2008">I’m only five foot four, and these guys were big guys, and I’m not a fighter, physically or mentally, I think, but after that I worked under police protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="2009">And I used to come back to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in which I lived under police protection, and one of the very nice Swedish boys at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> asked me, “Why?” </span><span class="sentence" id="2010">Because apparently the only other women who came back to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> under police protection where the prostitutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2011">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2012">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="2013">No, I had to explain to him that I’d been attacked, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2014">But, the community that was established there, there was a Dr. Lorch, L-o-r-c-h, from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , his wife who’s actually Brazilian Jewish — she was a Klabin, of the Klabin family. </span><span class="sentence" id="2015">The parents had come to <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> at the turn of the century from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , and they were a very, very wealthy family, and very concerned for refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="2016">They had worked on the refugees committee before the war, and they helped after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="2017">They were very kind to me, and there were several other families who did a beautiful job down there, but these people were people they hadn’t met before. </span><span class="sentence" id="2018">I hadn’t met this kind before, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="2019">I set up a small loans committee to try and help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2020">Their visas weren’t regular visas, you know, it’s coming back to the old story, and I had to legalize them, and the Brazilian government really didn’t want to legalize them except for Jeiko (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="2021">Yes, and it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="2022">Eventually, the government settled. </span><span class="sentence" id="2023">I must say, and I'll confess now that one or two who were Germans who didn’t know what they were letting themselves in for I sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2024">One or two of them, I managed to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2025">And we set up a small loans committee so that a lot of these men could become hawkers. </span><span class="sentence" id="2026">They bought goods on credit, and went to outlying <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> just as the original Strausses did in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2027">Some of them became very wealthy, and they calmed down. </span><span class="sentence" id="2028">Some of them were pretty awful people, and as with all groups, there was lovely people among them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2029">It was a very tough job. </span><span class="sentence" id="2030">I stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> for nine months. </span><span class="sentence" id="2031">It was a tough assignment, a very tough assignment. </span><span class="sentence" id="2032">When I came back to New York, and the British asked me — called me and said would I come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and the British asked me — called me and said would I come to England? </span><span class="sentence" id="2033">Because the British government was now allowing what they called hardcore cases to come into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2034">Hardcore cases for the British were families where the head of the family could not maintain his family either because of physical illness or even that they might be mentally disturbed, and so I went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and went into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> again to choose hardcore cases to come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2035">They were interesting, some of these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="2036">I had one young man who had been shot through the shoulder and had no profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="2037">We brought him to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2038">He was supposed to have had TB and be cured, but when we got him to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , we discovered he still had TB, and the British were not really taking in TB cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="2039">They had enough illnesses of their own, and so eventually, I took this man who behaved as though he were mentally ill while he was <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , eventually I took him back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2040">We flew, and it was quite surprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="2041">As we got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , you never would have known that he had behavior other than normal behavior. </span><span class="sentence" id="2042">When they x- rayed him, he showed no signs of TB. </span><span class="sentence" id="2043">I’m sure they thought the British were trying to get rid of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2044">He was quite an extraordinary case. </span><span class="sentence" id="2045">I think he couldn’t face being <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="REGION">territory</span> in which he was captured. </span><span class="sentence" id="2046">He was one of the strange cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="2047">Others were families with several sons and daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="2048">Some of them Orthodox Jews who made a very good adjustment to living in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2049">We moved them into <span class="REGION">areas</span> where there were Orthodox Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="2050">The Jewish Refugees Committee did a very good job on those people, and I remember another young — not a young couple, but a young man with older parents who the British brought in, and had him trained as a surveyor. </span><span class="sentence" id="2051">He had no college education, but like many people in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , you could go into a profession and train on the job, and he did very well and his parents adjusted very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="2052">Those families on the whole, except for this young man, who was very sad, were a success. </span><span class="sentence" id="2053">And then, of course, I came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2054">I became, I suppose, a cosmopolitan in a way in that I felt at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> nowhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="2055">I’d worked for so long with displaced persons, in a sense, it was the only thing I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="2056">But after coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , one of my friends convinced me I ought to work with the National Council of Jewish Women, their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2057">And I went to see them, and I must say they were very anxious to get me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2058">I don’t know why, perhaps my experience meant something to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2059">And I did work for them for — I’m trying to think how long — several years, until the wanderlust got me again, and I decided together with a friend who was a published author that we’d go off to <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> and see what the role of women was in the new <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2060">I didn’t realize we wouldn’t get visas, but I gave up my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="2061">My friend got an advance on a book about <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2062">She was already, as I say, a published author, and we landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> — or rather, I landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2063">She was coming later by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2064">I flew in. </span><span class="sentence" id="2065">And the first night that I was in the Frank Lloyd Wright Imperial Hotel, it was a very interesting <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2066">Everything was much too big for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2067">Everything was high, and the first night I was there, I met charming gentleman in the <span class="BUILDING">smorgasbord restaurant</span> who eventually became my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="2068">We got married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> because my family couldn’t think that somebody hat at last got me to say yes, and I ended up on the prairie in <span class="REGION">Illinois</span> , on the flat, flat prairie, which I found devastating, absolutely devastating. </span><span class="sentence" id="2069">Nobody knew me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2070">Nobody knew of the work that I had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="2071">Nobody was interested, and I decided, “Well, if I’m going to be stuck here” because David was a lovely, lovely man, “I’m going to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="2072">I’Il go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ,” which I had tried to do before I left <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2073">I had gone to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in the evening, but of course couldn’t continue because of the Blitz and things like that, and then I went overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="2074">I said to myself, “Pll get my degree here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="2075">And in the time it normally takes a student not having been in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a thousand years, I maintain a straight average — a straight-A average — got my undergraduate degree, got a Master’s degree, and then decided I would do what I always want to do and that was to get a PhD at the London School of Economics, and David thought that was a splendid idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="2076">He was very kind, and I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="2077">The semester was ten weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="2078">We had three semesters a year, and I had to be there for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="2079">I managed to skip one while we went on sabbatical to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , which is another story, meeting people I’d sent there as refugees, and came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , finished my dissertation, and in 1975, received my PhD from the London School of Economics. </span><span class="sentence" id="2080">And then I decided what one really had to do was to tell this story of what happened during and after the war because, as I say, nobody ever asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="2081">Nobody seemed to be interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="2082">There was one professor at <span class="BUILDING">University of Illinois</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2083">His name was Winton Solberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="2084">He was an intellectual history, and he asked me to write a course on the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="2085">I thought this was going to be a great opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="2086">I wrote the course, but I was a woman, and the history department wasn’t about to make funding available for me to teach the course. </span><span class="sentence" id="2087">But, women’s movement was beginning to get going, and Joan Huber, who was head of the department of sociology, said to me, “Amy, you can teach that course in our department.” </span><span class="sentence" id="2088">I have to go back and bit and tell you that I had competed for a job as an assistant to the vice president for academic affairs for the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , and there were two positions going. </span><span class="sentence" id="2089">There were 77 applicants, and Edith Terwilliger and I got those positions. </span><span class="sentence" id="2090">The former Vice President, P.T. Yankwich, now lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="2091">So, it was very interesting working for this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="2092">He was very bright. </span><span class="sentence" id="2093">He was an intellectual, and he gave me time off to teach the course, and since I got paid for teaching the course, it meant I could employ a graduate assistant and pay her that money, so she had money during the semester. </span><span class="sentence" id="2094">I gave the course over three or four semesters. </span><span class="sentence" id="2095">It was fascinating because the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> which I was assigned filled very quickly, and the computer cut us off, and I found that the students taking the course were children from all ends, or both ends, of the Jewish spectrum. </span><span class="sentence" id="2096">They were children of strictly Orthodox parents, and children of non-Orthodox parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="2097">They were children of survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="2098">They were children of Polish immigrants who’d come after the war, and one didn’t know what their parents had done during the war, and all of them were interesting because, if I told them, for example, the story of a pastor who had saved some Jews, they wanted proof, and my xeroxing bill was tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="2099">I always brought evidence of anything I told them that was positive about non-Jews who’d helped Jews, and I used to say, “There were good Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="2100">There were good Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="2101">There just weren’t enough of them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="2102">They were interesting groups of students because, as I discovered, those whose parents were survivors, they told me their parents told them nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2103">And I would tell them, “Perhaps you can tell them something of what you’ve learned in the class and see what their reaction is. </span><span class="sentence" id="2104">Don’t push them, but gently try to get their stories from them because it 1s still so painful for them — for them to tell you these stories.” </span><span class="sentence" id="2105">They were very interesting students, and I kept in touch with them for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2106">QUESTION:  Did they ask you — did you tell them about what you had done after the war or did you not tell them anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2107">ANSWER:  I didn’t tell them essentially, but I would — I think my classes were interesting because I would tell them incidents of my experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="2108">I didn’t tell them in the sense that I’ve told you, but I would tell them of incidents and that I knew of these incidents because of this experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="2109">I think they believed me because they felt that I was talking from experience, so they enjoyed taking my course. </span><span class="sentence" id="2110">I made it a difficult course. </span><span class="sentence" id="2111">When I say I made it a difficult course, I didn’t make it easy because of my experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="2112">They had to pass the grade, too, but no, I didn’t tell them because I — just like with Oscar Schindler, I didn’t think people were interested, and also, I find it very hard to talk about myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="2113">I might tell you this is the first time I’ve ever done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2114">Nobody has ever asked me before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2115">QUESTION:  Well, I’m really grateful, and so is everybody else who is hearing this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2116">ANSWER:  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2117">QUESTION:  Amy, you were asked to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to create an archive. </span><span class="sentence" id="2118">Can you talk about that, and talk about one of the pieces of information that you had found that really had been lost about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2119">ANSWER:  Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2120">QUESTION:  Can you do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2121">ANSWER:  My pleasure. </span><span class="sentence" id="2122">After my husband died, the head of the World Jewish Fund for Jewish Relief, no sorry, got the name wrong, haven’t I?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2123">QUESTION:  British Fund-</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Central British Fund for World Jewish Relief called me one day because she knew of my relationship to the organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="2124">She said they had found a tremendous stack of files in one of the <span class="BUILDING">garages</span> at one of the nursing homes, rather, one of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> <span class="BUILDING">nursing homes</span> , rather, one of the homes for the aged for former refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="2125">Would I come and look at it? </span><span class="sentence" id="2126">She knew that I came into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> fairly often because I did have brothers and sisters there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2127">And so I came and looked at the stack and was amazed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2128">There were a tremendous number of case histories on individuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="2129">They were files on children who’d been brought out from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> on kinder <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2130">There were minutes of meetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="2131">And I said to this woman, Ava Mitchell, “You have a treasure trove here. </span><span class="sentence" id="2132">You’ve got the archives of your agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="2133">Nobody knows their story.” </span><span class="sentence" id="2134">And she originally had been a refugee, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="2135">She said, ““Would you put it together for us?” </span><span class="sentence" id="2136">Well, I wasn’t an archivist, and I knew that the agency would never have the money to employ an archivist. </span><span class="sentence" id="2137">We have to remember that after the war, <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> was still very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="2138">I said I thought I’d like to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="2139">So, I packed my bags and came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2140">They gave me a staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="2141">Somebody had given them some money so that we can work on this archive, and Bill & Howe (ph) did our microfilming for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2142">They were very helpful, and they asked me to do a booklet on the archive, which I did which was published which was rather nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="2143">It took us about 18 months to put this stuff together, but it has proved invaluable. </span><span class="sentence" id="2144">For example, one of the items we found were all the records of people who had ever registered with the Jewish Refugees Committee from 1933 on, and that would be from May the 18", 1933, when the organization was started. </span><span class="sentence" id="2145">It would have records of people who’d been inquired about and you would find a card which would say, ‘Helen Comb — deported through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tiresenstadt</span> (ph) And it would give the date because somebody had come in and given this information. </span><span class="sentence" id="2146">And, even to this day, those cards are useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="2147">For example, if you want to prove that you came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> as a refugee, and claim your pension or money from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> or some funding which was due to you, we could look up your archive and see if your name was there, and it would give the date that you arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2148">Now, what happened ultimately, as we were working through this archive, I began to see names which said “St. Louis’, and that struck me because I knew of the story of the St. Louis, this ghastly story of these people who in high hopes went in party fashion, practically, to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , not knowing that they were going to be refused entry, not knowing that all but about 22 would be refused entry because the 22 had paid the extra money that was required to get a permanent visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="2149">And I start to make cards on them, and I found about 110 of the people who came into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> where it was marked St. Louis passengers, and I kept these cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="2150">And then one day I heard from the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , your <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , that you were going to do an exhibition on the people who sailed on the St. Louis and the face of those who landed up in Europe, but you really didn’t have full records of those who landed in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> , although you had names. </span><span class="sentence" id="2151">And I said, “If you give me all the names, I will be able to trace all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2152">And I must say it took me quite a while, I won’t tell you how many weeks, to go through these — the microfilm, find these people, and take a picture of these people, and I found all 187 of the people who landed in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> , and I felt very pleased because it will help complete your archive, and it shows the value of doing what we did and the money we spent on putting that archive together. </span><span class="sentence" id="2153">Archives are terribly, terribly important, and I only hope that people who may look at this film will realize if they have letters from people during the war, before the war, after the war, which might be useful, to find out from an archivist where they might be useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="2154">The family might not be interested, but an archive will be able to put history together, and without our history we have no future.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2155">QUESTION:  Well, Amy Gottlieb, it’s been a real pleasure talking to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="2156">Your book, “Men of Vision” is something people should read if they want to know about what <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> did, and the stories that you tell 1s particularly poignant now when we have 50-80 million refugees in the world, and how difficult it 1s, and how much care it takes. </span><span class="sentence" id="2157">And the care that you’ve given these people, I’m sure they all thank you, and we thank you for being here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2158">ANSWER:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="2159">And I must say that there are volunteers today from many countries of the world helping refugees overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="2160">I only hope they get the kind of the care that the British gave to the refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> before the war and during the war, and after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2161">QUESTION:  Yes, this history must be a repetition for you over and over again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2162">ANSWER:  Yes, you see the same kind of things happening that happened before. </span><span class="sentence" id="2163">If I were younger, I would go out and help.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2164">QUESTION:  I’m sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2165">ANSWER:  Thank you for inviting me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2166">QUESTION:  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2167">ANSWER:  [Badge shown.] </span><span class="sentence" id="2168">The badge that you see was given to all members of Jewish Relief Units who volunteered to go overseas during and after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="2169">For example, when Bergen- Belsen was liberated, more than a 100 people from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen</span> was liberated, more than a 100 people from England — doctors, nurses, lawyers, social workers, teachers, went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> to help those people who had survived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2170">This was the badge that the Central British Fund had set up for us so that we would be recognized as a Jewish team, so that survivors who saw the Shield of David would realize that we were Jews who had come to help them, and perhaps ease their burden somewhat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2171">QUESTION:  And where did you wear this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2172">ANSWER:  We wore this badge on the beret that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="2173">We also wore a Shield of David in blue and white on our sleeves as our insignia. </span><span class="sentence" id="2174">And we wore a British Army uniform at the time, British army officer’s uniform, actually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2175">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2176">End of Tape #4 Conclusion of Interview </span>
