<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Let's begin about your -- talking about your childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Who made up your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  My family was made up from my mother and father, Coto and Desha (phonetic) Becker. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My father was an accountant in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> manufacturing cigarette paper called Modino, M-O-D-I-N-O. My mother was a homemaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">We were pretty much middle class people. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">We didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , but we did have a maid who lived with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And my father, as was normal in the Thirties and Forties, worked and came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for lunch in the afternoon, went back to work, and came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> quite late. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">So the family was really together mostly in the middle of the day and in the evenings. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">As I said, we were not well to do at all, but we had a nice life, basically enjoying music and <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">https://collections.ushmm.org From the early Thirties on, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and was <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> for four years and --
QUESTION:  Was this a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> or private?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  It was a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">It was a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I was also a boy scout. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Reason for bringing that one out, that it became a segregated -- in spite of all the boy scout vows, it was a segregated troop, only Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And after 1938 or so, even the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> was segregated, Jews in one class, Christians in the other classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Yeah, we'll get to 1938 in a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Let's move back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Did you live right in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We lived -- well, up to about maybe 4 or 5 years old we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> , what would be termed in a <span class="INT_SPACE">garden apartment</span> today. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And then we moved into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> when I guess it came to -- time to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Did you live in a private <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  We were in a large, large <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  What kind of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Was it mixed with Jews and non-Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  It was primarily a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">It was a newer part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but it was totally integrated basically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  So you had non-Jewish friends and neighbors to play with --
ANSWER:  [had --
QUESTION:  -- as well as Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Because of classmates lived all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , not just in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> , my friends came from mostly from the <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And they were both Jews and Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  Was there any problem when you were very young about treatment of your friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  The only problem that we -- https://collections.ushmm.org
QUESTION:  I'm talking about when you were younger.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I mean, we're talking about the first --
QUESTION:  Few years or so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  -- Jewish laws coming in in 1938 when I was 9 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  And so until then there was no discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  And even after that, at least amongst friends, we had no problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So you moved into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> you said because of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  I'm assuming that's why my father changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">How religious was your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  The family was not religious at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">We -- I think we were Hungarian -- I know we were Hungarians first and Jews second.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  Did you observe any holidays at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , Jewish holidays at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  The only high holidays -- we observed the high holidays, primarily because my uncle, my mother's brother, was more religiously oriented. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">He was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in the Twenties, came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in '29, and then stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And so we used to go to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for the high holidays.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  But within your own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="56">https://collections.ushmm.org
ANSWER:  Within our own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we were not religious, although it was mandatory to have religion in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And once a week we had to go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and so learning Hebrew was part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Bar mitzvah was another part of 1t, which was orthodox because that was the only thing -- only religion, Jewish religion that was available. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">There was no -- in those days there was no reformed <span class="BUILDING">temples</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So I remember being bar mitzvahed in an orthodox one, which later on in our story comes out --
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  -- I found much later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">We'll talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Did you have any hobbies? </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I know you had mentioned that your family was interested in music.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Well, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Any other interests besides <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  I loved to play soccer. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I was beginning to be a pretty good photographer when I was about 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Iloved to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I was a lousy student. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">But basically I liked certain subjects and excelled in those. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And what I didn't like I didn't excel in at all, which really was the way I've -- the rest of my life turned out. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I enjoy certain things and I was good at it, but other than that I didn't work very hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  When you played soccer, were you playing with non-Jewish children also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Soccer, hockey, water polo.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And no -- and --
ANSWER:  There was a total integration in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , so there was really no -- I don't remember any even latent discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  Do you remember your father talking about any of that -- https://collections.ushmm.org
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  -- work wise?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  Iremember my father talking about politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I remember that when the German troops took over <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , my father was throwing out social democratic newspapers and so that if there was a search they wouldn't find it because it was unacceptable. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">But other than that, I don't think that he was aware of any -- and I know that he had coworkers that we have seen socially that were Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  Did you have a large extended family, aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  I had about probably four or five family members who were really family. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">There was an extended acquaintanceship, friends of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">But the aforementioned uncle, his wife and two children were really the only relatives that we had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">That was on my mother's side. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">On my father's side everybody was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> in two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> -- actually maybe three, but one is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nagyvarad</span> , which is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradea</span> today, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cluj</span> , which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolozsvar</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Otog</span> (phonetic) was the third <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where my father's family was traced basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">They kind of moved around. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">There was a substantial -- there was a -- an uncle, my father's brother, my father's mother and father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  Did you go to visit these relatives?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  I did go to visit them on school holidays usually in the summertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">One of the family members had a vineyard in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nagyvarad</span> , and I stayed there in a vineyard most of the summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I remember visiting there even in the wintertime because I'm remembering trying to kill myself on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> , some ridiculous <span class="NPIP">places</span> with a bunch of my cousins and other kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And that probably goes back to around 19 -- 1938, '39, 1937.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  What language did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="99">https://collections.ushmm.org
ANSWER:  Only Hungarian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  So that's the only language you --
ANSWER:  Only language spoken. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We did not speak Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We were not -- we were not very -- because of the religious orientation, we also didn't know anybody who was religious, and so the assimilated ones would not speak Yiddish even if they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And I don't think my parents could. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">My uncle did and could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Let's now start to talk about when you noticed a change in your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">What was the first memory or experience that you can recall? </span><span class="sentence" id="108">1938?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  1938 when the first Jewish restriction -- restrictive laws came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And that was --
QUESTION:  You were only 9 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  I was 9 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  What do you remember from that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  I was aware of the fact that the proclamation that Jews can now not do certain things and they can only do certain things in terms of jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  How did you know that at 9 years old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  I guess reading it and listening to my parents talking about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Were you frightened on hearing this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">We were not frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And strangely enough, in 1938 -- well, my grandmother, my father's mother from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> , went out to her two daughters in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , supposedly for the world's fair in 1938, and she stayed behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And in 1938 --
QUESTION:  Stayed in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  Stayed in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , never went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">My grandfather was dead by that time, and so she stayed with her two daughters in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">https://collections.ushmm.org The -- the husband of one of the daughters sent us an affidavit that would have enabled us, my father, my mother and I, to immigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But I remember my father worrying about the fact that he is -- at that time was 40 -- '38 -- 41, 41, 42 years old, the fact that he didn't speak any English. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">He did not want to -- he found that he could not get a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And he was not worried too much about the restrictions because they were fairly light, it didn't touch him. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">His job was not of that level. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And he felt that because he was in the -- in the Army during the first world war and he was an officer and he was decorated that they're not going to touch him. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And so he decided not to take advantage of this affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">As I mentioned, he was in the first world war. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">He fought on the <span class="REGION">Italian front</span> and also on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">He was in the infantry in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and he was an aerial observer on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I'm bringing this up because I have the -- I have his pictures from those times, which 1s the few things that were left. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And so the decision was made essentially to stay behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And as things got worse and worse in terms of the restrictions --
QUESTION:  Well, let's talk about how these restrictions applied to you and your family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  The first -- if I remember correctly, the first thing that I personally felt was the segregation in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So I remember the first two years of <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> we were integrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  How old were you when you started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  I was 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  7. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  It was 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  '36.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  And '38 and '39 got more and more restrictive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Separating Jews from non-Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="147">https://collections.ushmm.org
ANSWER:  Separated the Jews from non-Jews ina class. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Also --
QUESTION:  Were you angry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  I don't remember being angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I -- I remember being --
QUESTION:  Puzzled?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  Not -- authority was always paramount in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and government authority was, so essentially the government could do most anything that they wanted you to be or wanted you to do, and so the acceptance was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And I think that there was maybe a relief that, well, it's not so bad, we can live with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Some people stayed behind because of that kind of a belief, and some tried to immigrate at that point because they believed that things are going to get worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">My family wouldn't believe how bad things would be later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So there was no anger. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">There was acceptance. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">It was the law, so we got segregated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  Did you still see these children outside of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , or was it segregation in playing also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  No, the segregation was really in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and in -- in the -- even in the boy scout troop which was split up into families so-called of four or five children. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">The -- the Jewish kids had one or two of the families, and the rest of them were the Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And we played together and we were boy scouts together. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And I believe I remember as a boy scout marching when Lord Baden-Powell came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And it will be interesting to find it, whether he in fact did and did I remember it correctly, but I seem to remember a story that he told us over the megaphone that he had, I believe, scarlet fever as an adult. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">The reason for that was that God looked down and saw this person in short pants and said he did not have scarlet fever yet, so give it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">https://collections.ushmm.org Now, the story is basically that we did not have long pants as boy scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I mean, we were -- as children we had short pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Nobody had long pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Winter or summer we had short pants, and this was the gist of that story. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Whether I read it or it's memory, it's hard to tell, but I remember parading with all the scouts from all over <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in one of the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> , <span class="BUILDING">soccer stadiums</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  You would have been how old then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  Probably 8, 9, 10, thereabouts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">The first you said was segregation within <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  In class.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  Inclass. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And then next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  Second one, the boy scouts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  Boy scouts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  Then subsequent laws mandated that the men go into service, into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">labor brigades</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">That must have been around 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I'm not clear on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">My father was drafted into this, but because he had a medal for -- a bronze medal for heroism during the first world war, he went in as a company commander and was in for -- my guess is for a couple of years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">He was taken away to another <span class="NPIP">location</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  He was taken away to another <span class="NPIP">location</span> where we could visit him on occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  What was your feelings when he left? </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Was that --
ANSWER:  I think there was anxiety, but then there was acceptance. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Again, it was not -- there was worry, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">There was fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">There was no anger that I was aware of. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Acquiescence really what came into being at that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  Did he say anything special to you when he left? </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Do you remember anything specific? </span><span class="sentence" id="194">https://collections.ushmm.org
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">It was very matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I knew he was going to be an officer, and I guess it was expected. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">He did not really talk to me about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">My communication with him was loving but not formal necessarily, but except for the weekends didn't see much of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">My mother and I were always together. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">But I basically remember the good relationship with my father, a loving relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">He was a very nice person. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So --
QUESTION:  So you knew where he was being sent?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  I was -- I knew where he was -- well, I knew that he went in but not where he was going to be sent. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">But then he came -- then he was communicating with us and told us where he was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">QUESTION:  How did he communicate with you, by letter?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="408">ANSWER:  Usually the sirens went off and went down into the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> , which were reinforced. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And on May 2nd there was a particularly heavy bombing raid where -- where I was in a <span class="BUILDING">printing plant</span> , was -- and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> was hit fairly heavily, so we felt the earth shake and the dust and it was rather scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">https://collections.ushmm.org And after the raid was over, I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and found that the one half of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was also bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was basically blown out. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">The <span class="DLF">walls</span> and the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were blown out so that we couldn't stay up in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , but had to move down a few <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and moved in with a family including our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And so we lived there basically until we were finally taken away, but -- so that -- and shortly after that May bombing, it became quite unsafe to be in the <span class="BUILDING">printing place</span> , so I essentially moved back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And --
QUESTION:  What was happening to your father during this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  My father, we didn't know -- we didn't know where he was or what was happening to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">There was no communication at that point that I can recall, not until much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">So it was strictly my mother and I trying to make a go of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">QUESTION:  So what did you do during the day? </span><span class="sentence" id="419">What was the day like when you moved back with your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">ANSWER:  During the -- during the curfew I was out and I visited friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And I remember one particular time that -- again, my recollection is that we had curfew in the morning and then we had to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and then curfew opened 1n the afternoon again. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And I went off to a <span class="BUILDING">friend's house</span> , and I didn't call my mother that I am not coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> until later in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And when I showed up, of course, she was out of her mind and got a real severe spanking for scaring her, which I could understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">But at that time I guess I was not frightened of what could be happening to me, so I did not think that I should call her. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">But that was quite clear in my mind what happened then. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">https://collections.ushmm.org But we have played with friends in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and so except for the curfew when we went out and had to stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">We had ration stamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">We had to go out to find -- try to find some bread and -- which was by that time made from rice flour because wheat was no longer available. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And there were shortages of food, meat only once in a great while, very little sugar, very little staple food available. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And certainly during the curfew times, of course, all the Jews were out and trying to find the <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> that had something. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And sometimes the <span class="DLF">lines</span> were long and the curfew came so you had to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> empty-handed, which was difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  What was your health like at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">ANSWER:  I was not aware of being underfed, particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I remember that bananas and oranges were something that I remembered from early childhood and I was really -- would have loved to have some. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I think that bananas to this day has a significance because I remember eating it as a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">QUESTION:  But your health was okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">ANSWER:  But my health was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">So was my mother's. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">We were in reasonably good shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">As the summer wore on, things got tighter and the bombing got worse, and --
QUESTION:  Did you -- did you see any deportations during the summer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">ANSWER:  I believe that I was aware of the fact that the -- my father's family was deported, was taken away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I don't think it was called deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I was not aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I remember hearing people receiving postcards from various <span class="NPIP">places</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I believe, or <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> with stamps saying that we're okay, we're working, et cetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And of course that was a sham we found out many, many years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">So the awareness that they were killing the people, we did not have the awareness.</span></p>

QUESTION:  The summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  Summer of '44 was still reasonably safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">No one was deported because the Germans concentrated on the 400,000 in the <span class="REGION">provinces</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">QUESTION:  In the <span class="REGION">provinces</span> , right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">ANSWER:  And so we did not see any of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">What we did see, of course, later on when they started deporting people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , but that's not until September, October.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">So the summer went on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">ANSWER:  The summer went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Again, staying alive because of bombings was paramount. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">We spent an awful lot of time down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">We really --
QUESTION:  What did you do when you were down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">ANSWER:  Kind of sat around in the dark and hoped that the bomb is not going to hit us. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">We were across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">western railroad station</span> , and so we were in a prime target area. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And when in May the bombing finally got our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , it was a fluke because the Americans were fairly accurate. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Their system was -- is to send 1n an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> and to circle the target area with smoke in the <span class="DLF">sky</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And the bomber stream unloaded into that circle, saturation bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">The May that we got it but the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> didn't, the wind took that circle and we got clobbered. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">So the raids were pretty regular. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Around 10:00 at night they started, so by 20 of 10:00 we were down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> expecting it. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">https://collections.ushmm.org And I was working as a -- well, my doctor, my pediatrician was the head of the volunteer ambulance corps in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And after my stint in the <span class="BUILDING">printing place</span> , I asked him -- I suppose I had to ask him to see if I can get trained as a first aid person. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And I went through a course with adults, being the youngest to graduate from that course, and so I was a full-fledged first aid type. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And as such, I did not go down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> until the bombs came awfully close. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">We were also fire guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">We were 15, so we didn't like the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">It was a horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And so my poor mother scared out of her wits for me, but I was all over the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and watching for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> to come and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">antiaircraft</span> trying to shoot them down. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And when a bomb started whistling too close, then we ran down. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">So I really did not spend that much time in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> , ever really. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I felt it was better to die up there than not. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">One of the things that also happened in the -- after we had to wear the yellow star, that the Vatican curia I guess made an arrangement with the Nazis, the Hungarian Nazi government, that if a Jew converted, then they would wear a different color, I think it was either white or yellow or just white armband, and they would be basically exempt from the curfew or from the deportation, from the taking them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> , labor brigades. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And our superintendent's son, who was a priest in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , came back to the <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> and was trying to convert the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">His name was Kuhn, K-U-H-N, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And my mother and I went, took a few lessons, learned a catechism, and after awhile I refused to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And I remember I had the sense of abandoning one's religion under duress and that that was not right at age 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Not being a Jew, I don't know where that came from, but that was my feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">It's interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">It also led to another during the Korean War, that kind of a feeling surfaced once again when I was drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">https://collections.ushmm.org But the priest ultimately became known as the hanging priest of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">He was -- and I think that the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> has a picture of him with a pistol on his cassock. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And he went around the <span class="DLF">streets</span> shooting Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And he was hung shortly after the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">But 1t was kind of a dichotomy that he's trying to convert but his hatred was such that he would shoot those who didn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">QUESTION:  Did your mother willingly leave the conversion lessons also with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">ANSWER:  I don't remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">It seems that in some cases I took the lead and she deferred to me in making some decisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">One of them was a life-and-death decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">There was a suicide in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> once. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Somebody jumped off the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> above us and died. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And I kind of remembered that. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">That surfaced later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">But the time period between this conversion attempt and -- which had to be maybe August, September, October, things were really getting hairy. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And I remember being out on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> as usual and getting caught in a bombing raid away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after the curfew, because the bombing raid didn't end, and dodging through and hoping to -- not to get stopped by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And I'm trying to remember at what point, but it may be -- again, when we're talking about that 90-day period of September, October, November, things really get a little bit hazy, but I remember in one of the bombing raids I got caught under an <span class="DLF">arch</span> in an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> and were cowering, lying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And the raid was over, and there was a bomb, an unexploded bomb within 20 feet of us, right in the open arch area, and we had to step over it to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And of course by that time I began to see an awful lot of death and injured people and things were -- bombings were three, four times a day really. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And of course the Nazis were getting worse, and so the paranoia set in quite naturally that everybody was after me, whether it was on foot or in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And so things were going downhill fairly fast at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">https://collections.ushmm.org

<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  I would say October-November. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And I don't know how I had the guts to do it or why. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I just did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And I moved because I didn't like restriction. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And it pretty much had to be that period, although I was doing that out of the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish house</span> also for a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">But at any rate, I moved around. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">The danger, of course, was -- is that if you were stopped, you had no papers, pulled your pants down and if you were circumcised, they killed you.</span></p>

QUESTION:  You had not heard of Raoul Wallenberg at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">ANSWER:  At that time, I had not heard of Wallenberg at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">We were fairly well isolated and therefore, it's very difficult to -- to have had news of that type coming in to the -- in to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="540">If you had no -- no one that was visiting you, you didn't find out very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">We were aware of that one of our neighbors had the access to the Swiss Schutz-Pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">He was selling it to those who were able to pay for it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="544">ANSWER:  We didn't have the money, so we could not get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And at the same time, in the same time period, the Germans allowed, I believe, 1,200 Zionists to pay their way out of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">The -- I don't remember the -- I thought it was — it was either 1,200 people or it was $1,200 per person that they let go. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">But one family that did go was my uncle with his wife and two children.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="681">ANSWER:  We stopped at night, which also had an effect on me for all my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">If you were ahead of the group leaving, you were the first one to get to a <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> where animals were sold in the day time or the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> where the food was sold, so these were open <span class="REGION">areas</span> with the junk and with the animal droppings where you could pick a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> where you can sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">These were all open. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And we're talking about mid-December in Europe, which is pretty harsh. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Food was minimal. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Once in a while, we got a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I remember one bit of soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And on one of these, before stopping for the night, my mother gave that silver Omega watch away to get a loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And we had no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">We had nothing left after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">The march, itself, was pretty hairy. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">The idea was, of course, to drive us as fast as we can move so those who can't move can be shot and those were old and could move, they committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">There were people hanging from the -- from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and went on and on and on.</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="1274">Can't understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">But I mean again, it takes you back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">Everything continues to take you back and there's always some revelation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">So it's a life that was so affected and I guess what I try to do, rightly or wrongly, not to have my children grow up as children of survivors which has its own bad psychological syndrome. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">They are affected by more than even a survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">But we went through family therapy together with my wife and so that she could understand it a little bit more, so the children can understand it, and they seem to have grown up to be _ the two boys really normal American kids with some affinity towards Judaism, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">We took them back to and took them through where I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the affect was not bad on them which is good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">The children and I went back with my wife in the '80s, took them back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I was living, the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> that I went to, and as a matter of fact, interestingly enough, Cartie, who I met at lunch, her brother went to the same <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> as I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">He's evidently the same age as Iam. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">Sol promised to I did get, by the way, people found and sent to me some geography pictures and my mother's cook book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">And amongst the childhood pictures are some of the class pictures from the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> and a lot more including the one that's in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">But I guess what was curious my mother taught me to be independent and take care of myself and this is the late '30s, early '40s when that was not in vogue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">She certainly came from a traditional middle European homemaker background, not professional person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">But she taught me how to sew and how to cook and how to bake, 1n case, in case what, you know, I ask now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">They never told me to https://collections.ushmm.org expect something that will happen and I don't know if they were aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">But to this day, I bake from her book that she and I used to bake Saturdays cakes for Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">I still made just yesterday I finished up a Zahar Tort that is given to my sons and now to be a wife for birthdays. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">It gets frozen and air shipped wherever they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">They also cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">They don't bake they don't have to be competitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">They also take pictures which I did when I was 12 and I have my first picture still. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">So I feel that I imparted some good things and it wasn't that bad that they didn't know early on what was happening to their father and to their family, their grandfather, their grandmother, and all their relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">They never had nightmares about it so I think that it worked well that they find out about it under professional guidance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">I think that was the big thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">It may have been very difficult for them at that time but it did not affect them because the explanations were there and so there is no guilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">One of them just married a French Canadian Catholic girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">He's trying to wrestle with the fact that how should they bring their children up, if any. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">His wife told him that she's elapsed Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">His wife told him that if he really believes in Judaism and Jews and a Jewish religion and the fact he's wrestling with where I came from and what I went through, that she'll be happy to bring their kids up as Jewish and he's wrestling with it whether he should or should not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">It'll be interesting to see what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">Their older son married a Jewish girl and we have a grand dog at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">Q.

Which trial was this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">A.

What year was that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">A. 1945, early '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">Q. Early '45? </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">A. Early '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">Q. Could you just again go into a little bit of detail about how you got your Schutz Pass? </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">A. It's hazy but Iremember that the not the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> but it had to be an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> that, guessing, Wallenberg had set up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">He satellite offices as I understood it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">And somehow I found out about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">Being in a <span class="BUILDING">Swedish house</span> but not having been handed the document, I went to get it https://collections.ushmm.org and I remember hundreds of people <span class="NPIP">outside</span> clamoring to get in and I got in and somebody typed this up and got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">But, it was really a fullback position. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">It never was used, would not have by that time and this would have to be in January, by that time, these things were not worth very much, only occasionally would they help and I just didn't need it but it was something good to have in case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">So really my closest meeting was in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> with the children that I have come close to a Sweed or a Swedish delegate or somebody who worked for Wallenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">I was pretty much on my own other than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">It was very hectic and I had to make decisions whether to stay or move on or and went and then went back and still got back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , which may have been the best thing that happened to me at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">Certainly, my belief in God nose dived after that and certainly couldn't understand, which is what everybody asks, how can God let this happen and there was never any answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">The affect 1s ever lasting and I started talking about this to young people what I went through only very recently and I guess the reason for it is perhaps because people started asking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">My own family in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> did not have any idea what I went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">They never asked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">To them, it's AO years later it's a total surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">My in laws never knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">They knew I came out but not what came before it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">It was very touching. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">I went Nancy's uncle was dying of cancer just recently and we have been close to them because I liked him and I liked his wife and not so much the rest of the family but he and I never talked about this and we knew that he's not going to live much longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">So we went really to say good bye to him up in <span class="REGION">Vermont</span> and <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> where they retired and we talked about it then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">And they were flabbergasted that they never asked and they don't know why they didn't ask but they https://collections.ushmm.org found out and they were _ they felt better for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">But there's no asking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">I mean, when the little girl, the 12 year old 40 years later or I asked why she came with me, she couldn't answer it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">Iwas I escorted Miskia (sic) and her husband to receive the award from one of the Wallenberg organizations in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">I asked them what made them try to save the family, the front family, and they couldn't tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">So I'm not the only one who has no answers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">It happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">It's a reaction to an occurrence and it's kind of instantaneous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">It's not premeditated very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">In some cases, of course it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">Giorgio Perlasca and the Japanese envoy that was premeditated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">The front family saving was not premeditated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">It was do it quickly because it has to be done,

the answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">I don't believe I'm brave enough to do it but then you don't know until you get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">And hopefully it'll never be tested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">Hopefully never will people be faced with decisions of life and death ever again but that's too optimistic to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">I guess that's really basically it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">Q.
