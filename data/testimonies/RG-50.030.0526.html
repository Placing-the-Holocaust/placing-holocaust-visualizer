<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I -- my name is -- originally was Zygmund Shipper. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Now it is Ziggy Shipper, you know, because in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> Zygmund would have been a problem, you know, with pronunciation and -- but it was -- it’s Shipper now and it was Shipper originally, except the spelling was different, it was S-zed-y-p-e-r and now it’s S-h-1- double p -e-r. The reason, my wife decided when we got married, because when we had children they had problems at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you know, is it Zyper, 1s it Zipper? </span><span class="sentence" id="7">So we thought the best thing is that we change the spelling, and we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Now, I was born in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , second biggest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , L-o-d-zed, and that’s where I lived til I was deported from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  And you were born in 1930, is that correct?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  And tell me a little about your parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Well, unfortunately my parents, you know -- I come from a very Orthodox family, Jewish Orthodox family and my parents were divorced and my mother left me with my father and my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And with a Jewish family in the 1930’s Orthodox, divorce was as bad as death, or even worse, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">It was such a terrible thing for a Jewish family, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So as far as I knew, you know, after awhile, you know, I -- I thought my mother was dead, and I didn’t see my mother and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">So I was just left with my grandparents, of course, and my father, which my father worked, so I didn’t see that much of him either. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">But my grandmother, as far as I can remember, she was a wonderful woman and I owe her so much that I wish I could have told her that when I grew up, but unfortunately there was no chance of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Would you like to tell me your grandparents’ names and where they were from?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  I didn’t know who she was, but she says I’m your mother and maybe that’s what -- you know, maybe I thought how could you be my mother if my mother is dead, you know, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I -- you know, I tried to analyze it -- I did years ago to analyze it, which you can’t, you know, but no, I wasn't happy to see her and when she left I didn’t -- didn’t mean anything to me, I mean, she left and I think that’s it, I’ll never see her again, and --

<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  Well tell me now about the late 30’s and -- and how did you notice things starting to change in your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  Well, in -- in about 19 -- I would say 1938 there was a lot of talk about war. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">You know, eight year old boy, I mean, what did I know about war? </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I didn’t even mean -- didn’t realize what it means there’s a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And they said, you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the Germans will come in and they- | [indecipherable] and this was carry on like that til 1939, you know, and then 1939, you know, in September ’39, one morning I was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , you know, my father came to me and he said he has to go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And I said, why are you going away, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So I says -- I thought to myself, now here a mother I haven’t got, now I won’t even have a father. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Oh no, he says, don’t worry at all, Pll be back within six months because there’s going to be a war and the German armies are going to invade <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the first thing they will do is take all the young men away, you know, but you and your grandmother and grandfather and the children a -- they will -- won’t touch them, it’s only the young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Of course, he couldn’t have been more wrong, but nevertheless he left and I never saw my father again. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">He run away to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and I suppose conditions in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> were not that good either because at that time the Russians already were together with the Germans, they split up <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in half, you know, some part went to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So he decided to come back, and he managed to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was by then -- the whole of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was already occupied by the Germans or by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was a occupied part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="115"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L6dz</span> was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they annexed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">That’s the Third Reich. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So he couldn’t get back to us, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="118">But that’s what I had found out, later. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">But °39 when he left, you know, and within a few weeks, of course, the German armies came in and things completely changed straight away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  Do you remember that, when --
ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I remember certain things, not everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I-I -- I hadn’t seen it, but everybody was talking about it, first of all, as soon as they came in they destroyed most of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> in -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> especially, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And -- and you know, to -- to a -- to a child, even nine year old, you know, being brought up as -- in a very Orthodox family, you know, to destroy a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> is -- 1s the most terrible thing that could happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">But of course everything changed, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We -- we weren’t allowed to travel on normal transport like on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trams</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">We had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trams</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , we couldn’t travel on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trams</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I found out because I never traveled on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , you know, but you couldn’t travel on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Jewish doctors couldn’t practice medicine, Jewish teachers couldn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And of course, there was no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I left <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when I was -- in June. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">That’s where they had stopped it in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at the time and I was about nine and a half years old, and I never went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">That was my education in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And every day different things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I mean, ya -- you know, we couldn’t -- we weren’t allowed to walk -- not that people came out of [indecipherable] they were too frightened to come out, but you know you’ve got to eat, you’ve got to buy food. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And food was scarce because <span class="BUILDING">Jewish shops</span> weren’t opened, they closed them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We weren’t even allowed to walk on <span class="DLF">pavements</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">But of course children like my age, you know, we got away with it, we walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">But the thing was, you know, they called a je -- a -- a Jewish man, you know, with the long beard, which they knew he was a Jew, you could recognize the Jewish people that were Orthodox, especially in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">They used to -- first thing they did, you know, took out the beard off and I -- and I asked why are they doing, you know, I didn’t ask the Germans, I asked my grandmother, why do they do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="140">They said, purely to humiliate him, you know, because they know it’s the most terrible thing to have that beard cut off. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And then they made him wash the <span class="DLF">pavement</span> , for no reason at all, just to degrade him, to humiliate him, to -- and you know, you’re not even 10 years old, you cannot understand why and you keep asking question and there is like always, there’s -- there’s no answers why.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Did anything like that happen specifically to your grandfather?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">My grandfather didn’t go out, you see, and he was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and food was very, very scarce and he was getting weaker and weaker and -- and -- because he wouldn’t eat that food that wasn’t kosher and kosher food was almost impossible to get. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So he lived on bread an-and potatoes and things like that, you could still get some. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">But it was getting more and more difficult and then they decided, you know, to recognize every Jew that is not recognizable, we have to wear a Star of David and in -- in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> , like in [indecipherable] they used to wear one in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">We had to wear one in the front and the back so that the minute th-they saw you they -- they knew who you were, so you get beaten up, especially the older people, not -- you know, and the children started stealing food wherever they could, you know, to bring <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  Did you do that?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1288">ANSWER:  Well, I think it was both. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">I -- for the first, I would say 25 years, very few of us Holocaust survivors spoke about it, whether it was [indecipherable] I think there’s many reasons, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">When we first survived and came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , we were 15 - 16 year olds, you know, would people believe us if we told them, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">They would say well, you know, kids exaggerate, children, oh it’s a lot of nonsense, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">And then, you know, we were so wrapped up in -- in work and in marriage and in bringing up a family, now are we going to tell the children? </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">Is it fair to tell the children what you went through? </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">But the children started reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">My two daughters at least, you know, that’s t -- watching films and -- and then asking questions, you know, and they realized what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">And then, you know, the time came that some of us decided we’ve got to do is talk about it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">And my two daughters insisted on going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> where I’m -- was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">They wanted to see we -- I’m very close to my daughters and I -- they are very close to me and they wanted -- I said -- I said, why do you want to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">You -- you know all about it, you’ve seen it, you’ve read about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">They said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">We want to feel what you went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">I said, that’s not a -- what for? </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">Anyway, they -- they said if I don’t go, after time and again refusing, you know, they said right, we go alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">So I said I can’t allow that, so we all went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">And it was one of the better things I did in life, by doing it, because I felt then that I owe it to people -- I owe it to the people that did not survive when I speak to young students, I say -- when they ask me, why do you come and give talks? </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">Surely it hurts you, you -- brings back memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">I said, doesn’t matter what it does, I said, there are -- there were families, you know, that not one member of them survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">Now who is going to tell their story? </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">Because all the stories are very similar, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">So I decided then that I want to do a lot before it’s too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">I don’t know how long I’ve still got. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">So for the last sort of 15 years, 20 years, I’ve been going more and more to speak to students mainly, you know, to tell them what happened because of hatred, bigotry, anti-Semitism, racism, and the main -- the main thing I tell them is hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">And I insist -- my last two words to the students is, do not hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">And never give in, never give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">I don’t hate and I certainly didn’t give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">I’m not saying that’s why I survived, but I feel it -- it’s a little bit of a reason why, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">The rest -- 99 percent is -- was luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">It wasn’t that I was clever, it wasn’t such a -- that I was such a good person or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">No, it was luck and never have the -- the willpower, maybe, to live.</span></p>

QUESTION:  What kind of questions do they ask?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1424">ANSWER:  Well, all different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">Some are a bit silly ones, you know, like naturally young people, they want to know whether I met Hitler, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">I haven’t been invited to tea by Hitler, but -- but that th -- one of the main question, it’s always asked 1s, do I hate the German people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">And they cannot understand when I tell them no, I do not hate the German people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">Why should I hate people for -- most probably the people that they think I should hate are not alive today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">You know, they’re grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">And most German people are the same as any other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">Why should I blame something -- body for what their grandfather did, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">Do I ask me -- do I forgive them? </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">Now the people that did it, I haven’t got the right to forgive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">If there is a God, God can forgive them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">The others are the people that died can forgive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">I certainly haven’t got the right to forgive, but I certainly do not hate, and I beg of you, when I talk to them, do not hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">Because this is not an answer, to hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">You are the one that will suffer if you hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">So no, I -- I love the questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">Some, like I said, are silly, but some are very [indecipherable] how they -- the usual thing, how did you survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">I wish I could tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">It’s one of those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">People that are -- there are some students that are religio -- religious and they, do you think God wanted you to stand -- to stay -- to save you so that you can tell the story? </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">I said maybe, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">But I feel it’s very important it should be told. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">We’ve got to have awareness of what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1448">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1449">ANSWER:  Because you know, in another few years there won’t be -- the only thing you’ll be able to do is to read about us, what happened to the people in Europe between 1933 and 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">There won’t be anybody, you know, to substantiate the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">So people say well, is it true, is it not, and you can be the one to say, well, I met a Holocaust survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">I have been to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I have seen with my own eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">And I feel that’s important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1454">QUESTION:  Thank you very much for sharing your story with the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1455">ANSWER:  Well, it was -- it was really -- I don’t know whether pleasure’s the right word, but it was certainly my duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">The more people I tell it to, the more I am satisfied and I am happy about it with -- especially with the feedback I get, which makes me very happy that people do listen.</span></p>
