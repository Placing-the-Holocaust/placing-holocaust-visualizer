<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Will you just begin by telling me your name during the war and date of birth and where you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Okay, well my name during the war was -- I had several names, but the name I was born to was Annaliza and I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> Belgium in December 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  So you were very young at the time before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">You probably don't have too much memory about what was happening prior to the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  No, only very sporadic memories of my father and memories that perhaps are based on stories more than memories but I do think I have very clear pictures of going to the <span class="DLF">park</span> with my dad and playing with him and doing things that normally you would expect a boy to do with a father rather than a little girl and I thought that people usually ask me why I chose a profession that I chose and although my father was a very orthodox Jewish man and certainly would have never admitted to that feeling I think that I was his first born and I think he considered me in some ways his son. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I remember the feeling of going to the <span class="DLF">park</span> and playing with him and him being perhaps more involved with a child, particularly a man of his generation than you'd expect him to be particularly with a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">That's what I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  You had a comfortable family life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I remember having two dear little friends who lived with us in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and my grandfather and just pictures mostly not -- I remember I had a little friend who's exactly my age a few months older and his sister who was two years younger and we lived in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we were constantly fighting cats and dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">We couldn't be without one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">So, we almost really always be together and I also remember that I didn't like dolls and I used to get dolls and I used to give them to my little girlfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">She loved the dolls. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">That's what I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I remember being very comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I'm sure we were not comfortable I mean financially but I had a very nice feeling about the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I mean just my grandfather was a very sweet old man. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">He used to tell me stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">That's basically all I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Now what kind of business was your father in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I think he started out delivering milk and learning how to be a diamond cutter or something of the sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">He was very, very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">He was always going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , coming from <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and praying an awful lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">In my head it seemed like too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">It seemed like not a very tense life. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">He was going to work and coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we observed the Sabbath. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">We would always go for walks in the <span class="DLF">park</span> and things of that sort.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  Did you have non-Jewish friends as well, or were you mostly in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  I was strictly Jewish community before the war and to my knowledge, I don't think my parents knew anyone that wasn't Jewish except in an official capacity. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I don't know, postman, policeman, -- no social interaction with non-Jews at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Your neighbors were Jewish as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">The ones I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I mean I was a kid so I don't remember everybody who lived there but I would say the majority were Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Now, your mother spoke of a lot anti-semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Do you have any images of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  The only one is a story that my mom told me and that sort of became an indication of my early rebellion and that was at some point during these --right either at the beginning of the war or the pre-war period my grandfather was beaten up on the way back from <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> or threatened or harassed and he I think people were pulling at his beard and he hid his beard in his coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">When he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , he looked really terrible and very upset and he had told me that this was a Friday night that Friday night when men used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> they had a couple of angels who were watching over them and walking with them to and from <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So, when he came back beaten and so on, I asked him Grandfather where were your angels then. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So, that picture remained with me, his frightened look and the statement that I made then, I don't remember having made it, but it fits with the way I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So, and several people that I have met, in fact recently, very recently just about three months ago when I was last in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> said you are this little girl who said that. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">They remember that statement. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">That's the only evidence I have of anti-semitism that touched us directly but before I really don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  Do you remember what your grandfather's response was to that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  I don't think he said anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">He didn't say anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  Did you ever have to wear the Star of David?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  Yes, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Both my mother and I wore it I think after the men, -- the husband of this neighbor and my dad were taken I think to go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> , and we had to wear the star. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">One picture I have of that is that she used to always carry me over her should to hide her star so that we would travel in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley</span> or something and she would carry me so that her star and mine were essentially hidden to avoid being harassed 1n the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">She'd always do that, carry me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Do you remember, and I assume we'll be getting into things that I think you probably have a very clear memory of -- do you remember when <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> was occupied by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Do you remember seeing troops or hearing noise?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  I remember having to leave in the middle of the night and walking through <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and being petrified and having German shepherds, hearing German shepherds barking in the distance and dragging and running through <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I remember that, so I remember the German voices and the dogs, particularly the dogs and until maybe ten years ago I had to run if I saw any dog or heard a dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So, I've overcome that too, but I really was very shaken by a dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I couldn't go in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> -- and particularly a German shepherd, I would just freeze. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I would completely decompensate so I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I don't remember the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> per se. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I remember the terror of what appeared -- I saw my mother being frightened and I became completely petrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I remember that march through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and ending up in some abandoned <span class="BUILDING">home</span> somewhere and being there with a lot, a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I don't remember who these people were except for those friends that we were living with basically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  So you were running to hide from the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Yes, we were running to try and escape because at some point after the two husbands had gone to work, during that period some people came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they weren't really Nazis, but they pretended to be Gestapo and they beat up everyone in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">My mother and my grandfather and me and they were really beating us and I remember screaming and my mother screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">They finally left. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">They ransacked the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they were looking for money and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">They got in on the pretense of being Gestapo and --
QUESTION:  These were just Belgium police?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Yes, they were just Belgium police or Belgium hoodlums, not necessarily in any kind of official capacity. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">They might have just done that. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">This was a good time to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I mean it was perfectly acceptable. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So, at that time my mother I think and her friend decided to leave and try to join the husbands and I think that this is when we went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> with the idea of trying to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> because <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> was a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">If I remember when we got to the rondeveax essentially of where we were supposed to meet our fathers and someone to take us across the <span class="DLF">border</span> , someone had betrayed and so that's when my parents went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , the French camps , was one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that they went to. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I'm not exactly sure how we got out of there and they went to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and that period my friends and I went to that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that we were hidden in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  I just want to backtrack a second so I don't get confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Now you had mentioned that your father and his friend your neighbor were sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  In <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  This was before you went out into hiding into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I'm trying to get the sequence here. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">If you remember, through researching any dates, maybe that would help me too. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I mean that I know that you --
ANSWER:  I think the first time we left, because we left twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">The first time we might have gone all of us together to in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and that must have been '40, '41 somewhere around there. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And then we came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I think subsequently the men went to work again to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  Which was called?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  or something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  This was near I think?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Yes, in the north of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And during the period that they were away that's when we had the incident of people breaking into our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and then we left I think that's when we went through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and were supposed to meet up with the fathers and then supposed to meet up with someone who was going to take us across the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , but we didn't make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So, and we got caught that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">The first time we were simply sent back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">The second time we got caught by the French police who then put us into these sort of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transient camps</span> which are really deportation but I certainly didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I don't know how much my parents knew of what these <span class="NPIP">places</span> were going to lead to. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I'm not sure they really knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">At some point they heard that people who left there never got back. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I mean that through the <span class="DLF">grapevine</span> that sort of information started to filter through and so they found that out and that's when I was in the <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> they were at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and that's when they decided to run out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> before they were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  Now, as I understand it, the second <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they went to was ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  Were you in that at all with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  No, I think that when they were transferred to they had made some arrangements to take the children away and try to hide them, and that's when we were, my friends and I in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> near ;
QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , who was there, what was it like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  Well, the children ranged from about four of five years of age, somewhere around there until they looked very big to me, but actually they were 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I think the oldest were 16 to 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">There was a mixture. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">They were all refugee children. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Many of them were not Jewish and many were actually refugees from the Spanish civil war because this <span class="NPIP">place</span> was very close to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">It's in the part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> that borders on <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> almost so the catholic archdiocese of that <span class="REGION">area</span> had taken in some children from that war and kept all of them together in that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  So, this was a <span class="BUILDING">catholic home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  It was a catholic run <span class="BUILDING">home</span> but it ha connection to Jewish organization who was able to channel some of their kids into that particular <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  Now you were about how old then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  At that time I must have been about seven, six or seven because I was born 1n '36 and that must have been '42, '43 somewhere around there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  How long were you in this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  In this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I was approximately eight to nine months and that part I remember quite well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  Tell me about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  Well, things that stand out hunger, real, real hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Nothing to eat, but that didn't bother me because I really didn't like to eat but I remember my little girlfriend, food was her thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">She was this plump little thing and you could always shut her up by giving her food. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So, I used to run to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> at night and steal whatever I could find and feed her because she was crying all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">She was crying because she was hungry, and I was crying because I wanted my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So, we were quite a pair. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">So, hunger -- and I knew there was nothing to eat and whatever there was I couldn't swallow. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I just couldn't swallow any food there. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">The other thing I remember is lice and the worst incident which may look ridiculous now but was when you had lice they shaved your head, and I was very proud of my hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I had really beautiful long hair and when I found out that I had lice and I could tell, because I was really itching. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I hid in the <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">There was no indoor plumbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">There was indoor cold water to wash but no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I hid in the <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> for a couple of days and nobody could get me out of there because I knew as soon as they found out they would shave my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So, but they eventually did. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I had to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">They shaved my head, and it was absolutely horrible, just horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Now, it looks kind of silly but and it wasn't just lice it was scabies, you know the things that crawl under your skin, SO we were not really in very good shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And there was always a feeling of fear and just terrible -- feeling terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">First of all, not understanding at all why you were there what was happening, missing your family and just the terror basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I think I acted irrationally on many occasions where I would just run out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> in the middle of the night in the nightgown and just try to run away and being caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">You know, brought back to this, so we had songs but I don't know if they made them up or the older children probably did which referred to us having to wake up at 7:00 in the morning and having to wash with cold water and the son reflected that there was no food only some kind of vegetable, something like a sweet potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">That's why when people serve me sweet potato at Thanksgiving I say thanks but no thanks. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I can't even look at the stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I don't know if it's the same, but it's so similar that it's enough to turn me off. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">That's all we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">SO, there was a song that reflected the realities of the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  What was a normal day like in this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="144">What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  As little as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I mean I'm not a psychologist but if I look at myself back then I must have been -- I would qualify myself as a really depressed child, entirely depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I couldn't do much of anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">We were very regimented so we had to get up at 7:00 and we lined up. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I don't know if you saw the several films about <span class="BUILDING">children's homes</span> , <span class="BUILDING">catholic homes</span> I think is one of them where children just line up and they wash and then they go to breakfast and then they go to prayer. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">They used to pray but we sort of didn't pray along. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I believe that there were some kind of organized games, like playing ball or something like that and there were various levels of instructions, but I don't think I learned a tremendous amount. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I just don't remember anything that was organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">There was some instruction but I'm sure the way I feel when I think about it I was just there, but I wasn't there basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">That was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">We had to make our <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and we had to help in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We had to peel the few potatoes there were, the sweet potatoes, whatever this vegetable was. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We had to help clean up and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">There was nothing else going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Was it crowded? </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Did you sleep in the same <span class="REGION">area</span> with a lot of other kids?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">There were two <span class="REGION">areas</span> , there as a <span class="REGION">female area</span> and there was a <span class="REGION">male area</span> , boys and girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">We were lined up like in the old <span class="INT_SPACE">hospital wards</span> , a number of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> together one next to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">We had essentially no possessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We didn't have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">We just had our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and I don't remember if I had any change of clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I mean I don't think I had anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Maybe they provided us with some old clothes, but we didn't have -- I don't remember having a <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicle</span> I could call my own you know with my stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I had nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  How many kids were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  I really don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I'd say 100 or so, not more than that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  Were the people who took care of you nice?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  No, I don't think so, but it's hard to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I was just so unhappy. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I don't have good feelings about anybody there, but it may not be them. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I don't remember-- for instance, this incident with the hair, I thought they were barbarians when they did this. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I felt that this was a middle age torture but in retrospect maybe that was the only way to deal with the lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">SO, I Thought they were mean, but maybe they weren't. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I don't remember anybody being particularly kind to me or particularly paying attention to me but then they probably were understaffed and lots of kids and all of us were miserable and unhappy. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I know for a fact that I was extremely rebellious and did exactly the opposite of what I was told. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">It didn't matter what it was, I would just fight it. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I would continuously argue and fight scream run a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So, you really would have to be a very well trained professional to handle a child of that condition and they weren't. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I assume they were volunteers from the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> or from other relief organizations and I guess they did the best they could but I can't say that there was somebody there that was nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  You said you were there about eight or nine months, how did you get out of there? </span><span class="sentence" id="187">What were the circumstances?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  Well, the circumstances are a little bit muddled but apparently my parents send someone to pick us up from there because they were escaping to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> to the part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> that was occupied by the Italians as to the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  How did your parents get out of ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">ANSWER:  From what they told me is that they were told that they were going to be sent somewhere else and they sort of smelled a rat and they asked for one day off to come in and say goodbye to their children or visit their children and then of course they ran away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> during that supposed trip, but they didn't come to pick us up because they were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">So, they apparently sent some lady to pick us up, but my friend whom I spoke to yesterday, said that this person was afraid to travel with three children, so she gave us the money and left and told us how to get there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  Were you the oldest?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  He and I were the oldest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  At age seven or eight?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And I do remember parts of that trip like getting on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and getting off <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and somehow getting to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> , but I cannot recall the details of that but I know we made tt. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">My recollection is that there was no adult with us and he confirmed that that this lady had at least given us the money, she didn't take it and run, but she was afraid to travel with three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">She thought -- the way we looked with our shaven heads and with the lice and the scabs. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">We really looked awful so she decided to just tell us how to get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">We had grown up pretty quickly, and we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">We simply made the rondevoux with our parents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">That was --that's why I say it sounds like it's not true and just like a dream, but it is true. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We did get there and we did find our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">But I then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> it actually was a very happy period. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">It sounds also crazy but we were living in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and in the same <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> we had Italian soldiers and they were very, very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">They were not too interested in what the directives were from the Nazi government. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I remember them giving me chocolate and I used to go up with them and play with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I mean they were just very lovely people. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And we were together but the remnants of that previous experience were there with me and so by that time I was eight or so and I was wetting my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and I was screaming, having nightmares every night and waking up and screaming even though the days were fairly happy, the nights were just terrible, really terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">But that stands out as a nice time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> because we were all together and we would go to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> and I wasn't at the time fully realizing -- we lived pretty much for the present. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">As a child in general you don't anticipate much in the future, you know, at that age. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">We were together and we were having a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I could not imagine that first of all things would get worse again and that was not a temporary arrangement, that it wasn't a full time solution to the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">QUESTION:  I don't understand <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> was under Italian occupation, Italian German occupation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">But Italian, not German. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">The Germans came in later, so it really was strictly Italian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  Did you have total freedom as Jews at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">ANSWER:  Officially no because the official party line of the Italian Nazi government with Mussolini was also that Jews had to be deported and rounded up, but the orders were not quite as effective and there was very little discipline in the Italian army, and those people who were in the army just couldn't care less whether we were Jews or something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">They simply couldn't care less so we were supposed to officially hide that we were Jews, but they knew fully well we were and I think we were fairly free to go and do as we pleased. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I'm not sure, I think that the order of deportation sort of depended on your nationality and so my parents at the time might have become Czechoslovakian or something like that and giving me a different name and that name I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">If you had Czechoslovakian papers it really didn't matter at the time whether you were Jewish or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">For a short period of time the authorities respected the nationality versus your ethnic background. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">That didn't last, but for a short period of time it was that way and the soldiers who were supposed to execute the orders couldn't care less. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I mean they just did not round up people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  So, you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> leading what you felt was a pretty nice life in the daytime anyway’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  Do you remember about how long you were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">ANSWER:  I would say also about ten months or so approximately and then when <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> capitulated and the Germans came marching in through the part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> that had previously been occupied by the Italians.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">QUESTION:  When was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">ANSWER:  The end of --must have been the beginning of '44 or somewhere around there, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">The war was over in '45 and we were in for perhaps a year, so I'd say'44 or so, but maybe you can check the accuracy of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">At that point the news spread rather quickly that -- well they already knew what the Germans were doing to various people in various other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , so when they heard that Germans were coming they decided to run and again try to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> the second time around. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Things moved very quickly so 1t also became known that entire families were subject to being arrested and they would be preferable for women and children were still sort of led through without being bothered or had a better chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So, my mother and her friend and neighbor and my two little friends, we decided to leave from these to a border town Switzerland and to leave the men behind and they were going to try and find someway to get there, not by public transportation but try to arrange some kind of private way to join us. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">From there we were going to try and get through to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So, the train trip was uneventful, I mean my mother and myself and her friend and her two little children went along and we got to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I don't know if we stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> or I don't know where we stayed exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">In the meantime my father and his friend was going to come by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">They had found someone who was going to drive an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> and take them as being ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So, they established a point of meeting which was a block from the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where we had stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">My father for some really stupid reason decided to go back to his <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span> because he had forgotten his prayer shawl and his , and when he got to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> the Germans were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">So, he didn't make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They arrested him. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Apparently Mr. waited until the evening and then the ambulance driver says I'm not going to stay any longer because we're going to get picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So, they left and they came and dropped off Mr. Shimmer wherever we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And then I remember this most horrendous scene of my mother collapsing when she saw him come in alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">She immediately knew that something was very, very wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I just remember her just totally going completely hysterical and screaming and pulling out her hair and to me this was just the most frightening because I just came out from something that was relatively safe, and it just was everything fell apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">We stayed together for a while with those people and the family had their parents at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">The woman had her parents in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and so they decided to really push on and try to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and my mother at that point said she didn't care anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">She just didn't care, and she decided to stay put in , which was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we were at. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">At that point we got papers from people who proceeded us and who we paid a lot of money to get those fake papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">So, we changed our name again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  To a French name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">ANSWER:  A French name so my name was . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I had one or two names in between but I just don't remember and that was a terrible thing because they tell you you are no longer such and such but you are such and such, and you keep repeating it to yourself until you actually believe that you are this other person. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">It gets extremely confusing. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">At that point, I must have been around eight or so, eight and half, and I mean I was very angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">At that point I just became very, very angry about everything and we moved into an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in a private <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where they were -- actually 1t was owned by the people who lived downstairs and there were two floors above. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">The first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> was inhabited by a Jewish family who were German Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">They had become French, but they were German Jews originally, and then we had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which was not really a real <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> but just under the <span class="DLF">roof</span> where the <span class="DLF">roof</span> actually meets the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">It's called , like an <span class="INT_SPACE">attic apartment</span> essentially. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I don't know if we had three or four <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> there, but really two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> maybe, just two <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , one which was an everything room and one which was a <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">We stayed there pretty much to the end of the war with the false identity and at that time, my mother became involved with the resistance not officially part of it but harboring people who were in the resistance and also harboring a lot of people who were in transient trying to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">She would provide them with <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> and with food and when they left they left their papers behind and we'd get their ration cards for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So, at that point, we were really wealthy in terms of food availability. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It was a time for me where I was pretty much like a street child. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I did whatever I wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I was supposed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> but I never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I mean I said I was going but I played hookey and I was hanging out with sort of the worst characters of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but compared to what worst characters are now, I guess they were pretty mild. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But we just would go and hide and play. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">We'd play three musketeers and we'd play all these fighting games. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I just never showed up, and when I was there I was so disruptive that they used to throw me out, so it really didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">But I learned how to read by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Two things I was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I was reading voraciously. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I didn't understand a thing of what I was reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I just simply didn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I was just reading books and books. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Whatever it was, it didn't matter what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">It could have been the phone book. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">It didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">It was an escape, you know, and I could just not be in the present. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">It was away from everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I had another friend then who lived nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I was friends with all the village kids, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Then, the people who were renting us the <span class="NPIP">place</span> were very, very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">They were French, but they pretended not to know, but they knew of course that we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">They never questioned anything, but they knew and I used to go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with them on Sundays because it was kind of accepted and would be better that I would show up. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And my mother's French was not great. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">It still has a very foreign accent, whereas I as a child had really become completely fluent from that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> and in that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I was perfectly fluent so I could pass for French kid easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">They thought it would be a good idea for me to go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , so at least the child goes even if the mother doesn't show up. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I was quite taken by that service. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">As much as I had been anti-religious to my own religion, there was something very comforting about the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and the priests and there was a very safe feeling in that big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and the way the voices resounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">That I remember that feeling for the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Now, I hate the <span class="BUILDING">catholic church</span> , but I really felt very comforted by that whole atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">The daughter of the people who were renting the <span class="NPIP">place</span> to us had her solemn communion as they call it, and I was very envious. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">They wore this white dress and this white veil and to me this was like I don't know, utopia, to be able to do all these things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">QUESTION:  Do you think unconsciously anyway that you knew these people were not being annihilated the way Jews were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">ANSWER:  Oh, I knew that going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was a safe thing that once you belonged to that group you were Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So, I guess it was wanting to be safe and wanting to be part of another group. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I mean I knew that I couldn't tell who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And, as I said, I was really very angry and I was very nasty. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">One of the people that my mother had taken in in the meantime until they got someone to take them to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> was extremely fearful for good reasons and was not leaving the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I mean it was just really sequestered and would not go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">My mother was circulating freely with her fake papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I mean if they would really look into it they would have found that her French was not great and she would have been picked up, but she braved it so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I certainly could pass for a French kid, but this man and his wife were there and they were absolutely petrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">He, in particular was just I mean, he wouldn't leave and we had curfews where we had all the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and so on, and I used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> supposedly from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but from wherever I was hanging out and I would scream at the top of my lungs for him to come down and I used to tell him that he had to carry my bookcase up. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I had this little thing, and if he didn't I was going to give him away to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">You could see the warped feelings that in some way I could pass for not being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I convinced myself that I was catholic and I was going to be find. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I also knew this wasn't true, but somehow I took it out on this poor guy who was really terribly frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I mean I can still see myself standing at the foot of those <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and screaming, you come there and pick up my bag and if you don't I'm going to tell on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">He would come, you know, he would just come. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">He didn't know what to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">QUESTION:  You were trying to exercise some sort of control?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">ANSWER:  Yes, like I could go out and he couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">But deep <span class="NPIP">inside</span> I knew this was just really not true, but somehow we managed to fake him out a little longer and he didn't have papers and he did nothing and he didn't know French, and he looked real Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">He would have been picked up very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">In incidents like that where I was just doing really nasty, very nasty things. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">They were really a way of saying, you know, I can do what I want basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I'm not going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I can just do whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Nobody can tell me what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">There were some terrible moments for me because my mother was frequently gone, and I never knew if she was going to come back, and there were nights where there were alarms for bomb raids, and those were really horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">They were just just horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I would be totally, totally petrified and I had to run to the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I was afraid to get out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> let alone -- it was all in the dark-- let alone go down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and go to the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I usually managed to somehow make it to the people below and we'd go together. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">So, when she wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but then to go back to my <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">I mean she didn't want to always say that she was leaving, you know, to the other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">You don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">They could put a trace on her. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">She was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">She was getting watches and she was then going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and she was selling them. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">She was doing all sorts of weird things just to get some money to survive, and she was helping people get across the <span class="DLF">border</span> , so she really never wanted to say what she was doing and she didn't tell me either. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">She would just tell me I'll be back as soon as I can, but to an eight year old, that's not that reassuring particularly having been separation where I didn't know if I ever was going to see her again having seen her reaction to my father's disappearance and knowing that that certainly was not really good. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I was really scared, I mean really, really scared.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  Was the <span class="DLF">bomb shelter</span> in your <span class="BUILDING">building</span> or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">ANSWER:  It was not in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , 1t was somewhere further away. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I don't exactly know where it was, but we had to go walk in the dark, run basically and to this day I must say that I'm still afraid of the dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">If I'm in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> alone, I'll have every light on. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I just won't be -- I really have to talk to myself to be able to turn off all the lights and say nothing will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">We were in the dark because of curfew to begin with and then you weren't going to start taking flashlights going to a <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">That was really better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">QUESTION:  The Jewish family on the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , did people know they were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  Well, they looked awfully Jewish, but they were French citizens and so they thought -- I don't remember, or I don't think that papers in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> said that you were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">The French documents, I don't think that they mentioned religion but I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">They looked awfully Jewish, because she had a wig, but he was a lawyer and he was a very distinguished gentleman, German origin, and perhaps he thought that was going to save them. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">It turned out that he was picked up a day or two before the liberation and he never made it back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">QUESTION:  Did you help your mom with any of these activities in small ways or --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">ANSWER:  Well, I'm sure I helped just with housekeeping things. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I'm sure I did some of the shopping where she'd send me to buy food. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I remember going to the <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> and doing all of that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">In a more concrete way in terms of I mean I remember seeing all these people, being upset because sometimes we had ten twelve people sleeping in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">We had five or six people in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , so I was not thrilled and I did sort of threaten some of these people, but for the most part I was probably helping her as much as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">I know that as I said I'm sure I did the shopping and I brought food <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I helped her with cleaning up and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I didn't go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> with her to sell watches.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">QUESTION:  It's interesting that your mother, as you described it, really fell apart when she didn't see your father, and yet it sounds like she was pretty courageous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">ANSWER:  She was extremely courageous but she was courageous throughout but that first impact, that first shock and this is what I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Now, I think there's nothing worse for a child than to see the mother fall apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">As long as the mother is still in tact then they know they have somebody to lean on. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">I realize at that moment that something terrible had happened to my father but I didn't realize exactly what but when I saw her, it just hit me like a sledge hammer. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">She was really gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I mean she was just not -- I don't know that it lasted a few hours and maybe the next day she sort of composed herself and she certainly picked up the pieces and went on and survived, and not only survived but helped me survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">There is no question about it, I would not survive without her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">QUESTION:  When you think back on the kind of person your mother is, do you think it was predictable that she would get so involved in illicit activities like this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  No, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">But one thing about her is that even though she came from this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> from this very orthodox background, she was quite somewhat of a maverick within her generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">She was orphaned very early, I don't know if she told you that, but she was about six years old when her mother passed away, mother and one brother went with the Russian flu, so she was very young at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">She became really the housekeeper for her father for a short period of time, his mother came and took care of the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , and then she got killed in some stupid accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">She got kicked in the belly by a horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">She went to <span class="BUILDING">market</span> , so she lost her grandmother maybe a year after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">So, she really became the woman of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at age eight or nine or something, so she was quite independent. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">She had to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">She's a really intelligent person and she was always interested in a lot of things so she became interested in zionism, and so she took Hebrew lessons secretly because it certainly was considered inappropriate for a girl to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">So let's say that it's not totally out of character to do things which one would not have expected of a woman of that generation and that background. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">She adapted. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">She learned Hebrew, she learned French. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">She even learned English at that point on her own. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">She didn't have any formal schooling, and she's really a very educated person and it's all self made. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I think that she had no inclinations to be a delinquent let's say but certainly to take charge of herself when needed, and so she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">This was the only thing that was opened to her, so she did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I mean the smuggling of the watches with the resistance that was really self preservation. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I think to some extent she I don't know that she really cared that much about herself at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I think she just forgot about herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">She just did things for the wider picture if you wish, but she was no longer afraid for herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">She sort of thought well, you know the worst has happened as far as her husband 1s concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">She had to leave her father behind in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">She couldn't take him because he wouldn't come. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">He had to cut his beard off and he wouldn't do that so he stayed behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">She already had lost her mother and a brother so somehow she felt it doesn't matter anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">There was her child, and so I think she did a lot for me, for my sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">QUESTION:  Even though the people like your landlord who probably looked the other way and knew you were Jewish and was very kind, he must have had some concerns about all the people coming in and out of your <span class="INT_SPACE">attic apartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">ANSWER:  He might have, but I wasn't aware of any frictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">That she could tell you much better. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I was very welcome in their <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">These people were -- he had been a fighter in World War I and he had actually lost a leg or suffered a severe injury so he was limping or had a wooden leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I just remember him limping rather heavily, and she was just a very sweet lady and they could not have children. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">In fact their daughter was a adopted one. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">She was one of 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">The woman's sister had 14 children so she adopted her youngest. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Then I was sort of a welcome addition in a sense because she had hoped to have a large <span class="BUILDING">household</span> with a lot of children, and she didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I felt so good in that <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">It was very warm and just normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Basically it was just normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">So, that I really always felt very good there, and my mother still writes to them every Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Every Christmas she sends them a box of chocolates. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">The older couple is now gone, but the one girl, the one whose communion I envied so much is now a grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">She's in her 60s. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I don't think there could have been too much antagonism. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Like I said, he fought in World War I and he was not very fond of the Germans at all, and he was a really strong French patriot and this invasion did not sit too well with him, and he was sort of in a way sorry that he was too old to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">So, I think in that sense, he knew we were Jewish, but he wasn't quite too sure and all that activity to him sort of looked like a good thing in the sense of being resisting the occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Although he wasn't personally involved in my knowledge, he sort of turned away. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">They were in their 60s at the time I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">They looked very old to me, but again, now that I'm going to 58, it doesn't look that old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">QUESTION:  How did you hear about the liberation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">ANSWER:  I'm not sure how, but I remember that we all were dancing in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">The entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was there and there was really a jubilation and I didn't fully -- so I guess it came over the radio and all the people from the resistance knew that the end was near.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">QUESTION:  Do you remember when this was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">ANSWER:  It was May 8 of '45, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">QUESTION:  This <span class="REGION">area</span> wasn't liberated until then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">ANSWER:  No, I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">It was the final -- 1t was when they gave up. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">There was no liberation there in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I mean they were there until the very last, because they picked up this gentleman, my neighbor, a few days before, literally a few days before. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">She had a baby right then after he was gone and something really very moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">My mother went to the maternity with her, for the delivery, and he turned 50, this young man just recently and his mother lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and so does he and the mother called up my mother from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to remind her of the night when she gave birth that she had been present at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">That was 40 years ago, so that '44, the end of '44 beginning of '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I don't think it was liberated before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">End of Tape 1 Tape 2
ANSWER:  When we went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> on that final trip back, we stopped again, me and my complete negative and angry nasty self, we stopped several times on the <span class="DLF">road</span> to drink and at one point the only thing that was available was beer and I said I would rather die than drink beer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">QUESTION:  Which might have been the choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">ANSWER:  A person told me well, maybe you're just going to have to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Maybe you're just going to have to die because that's all we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Telling me, a nasty kid.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">QUESTION:  Okay, just to backtrack a bit from where we stopped the tape, upon liberation your first memory 1s everyone dancing in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I remember just elation. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">That's the feeling for everybody and sadness. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">My neighbor because she had no trace of her husband, and I remember that and I remember my mother leaving and going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and telling me that she was going to find my father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">QUESTION:  You were all alone then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">ANSWER:  At that point I remained with the landlords. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , but in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I had been pretty much alone for a long time, so at that point I wasn't even all that scared because it sounded good. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">So, as I said my mother came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I don't know how long she was gone, whether it was a week or a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">She said we are going back. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">She had found my dad and that was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">So, we went back and finding him was the real disappointment, because he had changed from the memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I mean I had this illusion you know as a four year old child your father and the way he was involved with me and he was really -- he was not the same person and by then I was nine years old and I could see things very differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">He came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I saw him, he had no hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">His teeth were shaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">He looked like a skeleton. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">He just looked frightening to me, very frightening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">QUESTION:  Where had he been?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">ANSWER:  He had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And, he was extremely -- he had become very impatient and irritable and I just wanted to cling to him and it was broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">It just wasn't there anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">We were just coming from different <span class="NPIP">places</span> all together, and he had become even more religious and rigid about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I had at that point completely rejected. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I mean I just couldn't deal with that at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I was doing whatever I wanted during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Certainly not observing the Sabbath, and all of a sudden we're back to not turning on lights, and not going to the movies on Saturday and all that sort of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I yust couldn't deal with that at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I mean I just couldn't deal with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">So, we had lots of fights, really a big arguments and right after we came back we lived in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that belonged to one of the people that we had met in , a Jewish lady whose husband did not come back and who had owned a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with her husband and so we lived in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I remember the three of us, my mom, my dad, and I sleeping in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and he was having the worse nightmares and he would scream int he middle of the night and of course I would just relive all my terrors. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">It was just not what I had hoped for or what my fantasies had about how it was going to be when my dad came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">The reality was very, very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Not only that, we pretty much had no money so we had very cheap <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> would collapse every so often so between the screaming and the collapsing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> I mean it was really terrible and we didn't have any warm water. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">We just had a pump in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">It really was very primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And then in my view what really made things completely disastrous was when my father found out about his surviving relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">He sent for them, and where I was really craving just my mom and my dad, all of a sudden these people descended upon us. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">There were two brothers, a sister and a grandfather, and we all lived together. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">There were ten people every day, all the time without any <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> for anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">It was literally a nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">To me, this was a nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I resented them for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I mean there was nothing else to do but I really couldn't say I was very thrilled with that whole set up and then to top it off, my brother was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">My mother couldn't handle it. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">She simply couldn't handle the food for all these people, so I essentially was trusted as the permanent babysitter for my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I was in charge of him basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I had nothing to say about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I had to feed him and dress him and just take care of him, except for going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Things were just not great. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Then, at that point, all my fears came through. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I could not stay alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I tried, I remember that my parents wanted to go for a walk on a Friday night after dinner and I would say sure I'll stay, and as soon as they walked out I was just overcome by such fear that I would just scream by myself in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my neighbor upstairs would come and get me. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I was trying. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I always said, sure you can go. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">I'm fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I'm great, no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">As soon as maybe five minutes after they walked it would just come and engulf me and I couldn't really function very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Then <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was another nightmare because we were people of all ages put into the same class. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Now, I was put in the right grade for my age, but I really knew nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I just knew how to read because I had read -- and I spoke French beautifully because finally I began to understand what I was reading and I developed a very nice vocabulary. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">So, on account of that they decided to put me in the proper grade for my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I knew nothing, so I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> feeling like I was among -- just what am I doing here. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I don't know, but I made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I don't know how I made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I just picked up whatever had to picked up and there were people there who were speaking Polish and there were people speaking Yiddish and there were those who were speaking German and I was speaking French. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">The teachers were themselves, they came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> or other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">They didn't know anything about anything except they had sticks and when they misbehaved they hit us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION:  This was the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">QUESTION:  They just rounded up whom they could find as teachers and there were no one that you could really call a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">But I don't know, I just somehow started to click and I became their prize student, so that was another thing that I always had this thing of taking out this anger in some way, so they had these donors, these potential donors and they were trying to raise funds. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">It was a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> , so they would parade the bright kids around and they didn't have that many. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">This was like an ape in the circus, do this trick and do this trick. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I would recite, they would ask me a question and I would always know the answers. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Then, after that, there was nothing in terms of discipline that I would obey. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">We had these individual <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> you know, and I would just run across on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> and teachers would run after me with a ruler. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I mean some of these teachers are still alive and when they see me they say all this grey hair is from you. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I mean, I was just impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">When I think about it now, really I under normal circumstances would have gone to a <span class="BUILDING">reform school</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">It sort of calmed down and at that point, somewhere around the age of nine or so or ten I said I'm going to do something with me life. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I'm not just going to be a housewife and sit here passively and have some guy tell me what to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">QUESTION:  At age 10?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I had a big argument with my mother's friends who told me I should think of getting married when I'm 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I said no way, not ever, and I decided to get there I had to get to a better <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and so I was in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">This time in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> it's divided into six and six. </span><span class="sentence" id="526"><span class="BUILDING">Elementary</span> and then <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> is six years, and I decided to go to the <span class="BUILDING">public high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">The <span class="BUILDING">public high school</span> which was at the time considered the top <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> because from that one you could go straight to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> without having to take special entrance examinations. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">So, after two years I applied to that <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> which was unfortunately in Flemish and that was a language I didn't know at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">So, the only Flemish I knew was from talking to the cleaning woman who used to come once a week and that was the extent of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">But I made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">I mean I got in somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I guess I faked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Whenever I think about it objectively I should have never gotten in there because my knowledge of everything was completely sporadic and having big gaps in various <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I never learned how to do multiplication, things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Big, big gaps, but I got into <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , because it wasn't automatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">You had to apply to get into that particular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">So, but there was anti-semitism in the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">QUESTION:  After the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  After the war, quite a bit, and there was only two Jewish girls in that whole <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , another one and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">We really had a tough time. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">It took us years to be accepted and to make friends only a few friends we made on the whole the atmosphere was not welcoming at all, not at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">QUESTION:  Were you blamed for the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  No, but for instance my dad was religious at the time there was <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Saturdays, and he didn't allow me to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">It was a horror show. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I already had missed so much <span class="BUILDING">school</span> throughout my life and of course they put Latin and Greek and math and whatnot on Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">This really is not easy, and the teachers refused to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I mean I would have to go every Saturday night -- I mean that's why I became even less attracted to the religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I had to go and beg from some girl who really didn't want to give me her notes for all the lectures that had been given that day and then try to work it out on my own because my father didn't know anything and my mother didn't know anything about that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">The teachers just said, her statement was, "Well, you Jewish girls don't want to come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Saturday, you just work it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">It's not my problem." </span><span class="sentence" id="551">It makes you feel that after all that hearing this business about Jewish girls -- 1t was a <span class="BUILDING">secular school</span> , it wasn't a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that was under any kind of religious aegis or directives. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">That's what the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">It was a <span class="BUILDING">secular school</span> where there was religion given according to what you wanted so there was one hour you could choose either religion or ethics so you didn't have to attend -- because there was a catholic school system just as there is one here an official catholic school system. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">So, the people who were there, weren't even observant, but they still had a feeling that we were foreigners. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Essentially the feeling was that we were foreigners. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">We were different and foreign. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">We did not feel very well there, really not, and then later they opened a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> and most Jewish kids now go to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> , which is now fully accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">QUESTION:  Still?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">ANSWER:  Yes, oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">They go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> , which the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> is accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">It's a completely official <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and they can get from there to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , again without entrance examinations, so and that's what I had wanted but there wasn't anything at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">We were, as I said, in fifth grade, everybody was together, all ages, all languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">This <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> developed just a few years after I started high school.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">QUESTION:  What happened to your grandfather?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER:  My grandfather I think was essentially beaten to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">My mother's father, the one who's picture is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">He refused his son, my mother's brother, left I believe it was the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> and then somehow got to the <span class="COUNTRY">states</span> , and he didn't want to go because you had to cut your beard to get on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I think when we fled, he refused to come for the same reason and so apparently my mother had asked a neighbor, a non Jewish neighbor to take care of him and she said she would but she heard when she came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> that he had essentially been beaten to death on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">QUESTION:  What other aspects to your life during these years do you think are real important to remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="570">ANSWER:  You mean during the war years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER:  In what sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">QUESTION:  I don't know if I have all the right questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I think that we covered the <span class="REGION">areas</span> that I had some idea about, and if there's anything else that you think would be useful to record that I haven't asked you, I want you to feel free to say it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">ANSWER:  In terms of who I am today, I would have liked all this activity around survivors of the war whatever events took part in their own lives to happen earlier because even as I tell these things and some of these things bring tears to my eyes so that 1 know that I still feel them, but they're not -- I think I'm now perhaps able and it hasn't been that long -- able to associate my reactions to trauma and whatever from the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">So, it's hard for me to say now. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">The worst part of it was the fear, you know the absolute terror that I can still invoke certain times thinking back particularly --the salient points were in that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where I just didn't know where anybody was. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And then when my dad was taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">These were just terrible, terrible moments. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I know that until he died, my father -- I had many, many nightmares about anticipating his death that they were just really terrible and I was acting irrationally during many years in relation to him in terms of being so afraid that he would die that I could not even enjoy when I was near him. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">He wasn't a well man, although he pulled together and rebuilt a life for himself and helped his brothers build their own lives, so he did a tremendous job. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I couldn't even appreciate any of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I was just always afraid of losing him so that was sort of something that marred my life for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">In fact, I think I was liberated from that feeling only when he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">When he finally died, I sort of gained some peace which seems sort of crazy, but that's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">When he died, I said okay that's over. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">He's really gone and he's not coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">That's it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">QUESTION:  Are you at all religious today?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">ANSWER:  No, I'm not, but I observe the traditions because I think they're pretty and perhaps only recently I have trouble with dogma in general. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I have trouble with authority, but there is sort of a deeper philosophy which guides the lives of those who are truly religious and I really don't refer to people who are shut off from the outside world like or that type of think. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">I'm thinking of my brother who is really an exceptional human being in that he lives his religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">This is who he is in terms of his interaction with his wife and his children, his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">He lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> because that's the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> where he can be the full Jew in his view, but he's politically left wing so -- and when I see him, there's a deep meaning to the rituals that is not the superficial type of thing that many people see and rebel against which is the things that I rebel against. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">You can't go here, things that look totally idiotic to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">It's a lot easier to take an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> let's say for a person my mother's age and condition than to walk upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">That kind of thing, but when you go deeper and you make it part of an entire frame work and what it means, then I'm beginning to appreciate it although I think I live my life in a certain way in that sense, in terms of how I relate to my mother and to my family and I'm really a very good friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">People know that I'm really a loyal friend, that you couldn't have a more loyal friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">But I have no inclination to do the ritual, but I do like to go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on high holidays only because I identify with the group, because I like to be identified with the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I'm proud of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">But not in terms of observing the things that I consider interfering with the conduct of modern life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">QUESTION:  The obvious reason I asked that was clearly during the war years you appeared to be a little bit resentful of it and sort of embraced the security of the <span class="BUILDING">catholic church</span> and all these other things and I think people certain people after the Holocaust felt stronger about their Judaism, some felt irrelevant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">ANSWER:  I don't want any part of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">QUESTION:  Or they had been abandoned by it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">ANSWER:  I think those that felt abandoned by it I felt abandoned by it, but as I said the story about my grandfather and the angels, I was maybe four years old when I asked him that, which I mean this is a logical question to ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Where are your angels, and there's no logical answer to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">So, then of course there was no time to practice the religion after that whole incident because we weren't supposed to be Jews anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">That's one of the things I resented when my dad came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I embraced catholicism only because it represented a safe haven and not because of anything that had to do with Jesus or anything like that, didn't appeal to me very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">What appealed to me really was the ritual and not the content. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">What appeals to me in Judaism really is more the content and not the ritual. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">The ethics behind it and so I think I'm a very Jewish person and I don't hide that anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Perhaps if I were in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where nobody observed anything I would do it just to express my Judaism to the rest of the world that way, but I don't feel that I have to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">But as I said, I do identify with the group, so --my mother says that after the war my little girlfriend, the one that I had spent all this time with in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and so on and we stayed friends for a while after. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">She became religious and I wasn't, but a certain point in time we were going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> for the high holidays and our mothers would try and make us pray and we would just giggle. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I mean that's all we'd do, we'd giggle. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">We could just not do pray or do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Then when I went to study, I left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and the very first Rosh Hoshana Eve I went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I didn't even go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I stayed <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the entire time, but I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">You know, I just felt that I had to express that I was part of that group but I wasn't going to pray because the prayers meant nothing to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">The prayers are sometimes very pretty if you look at them in terms of poetry, but I really don't believe in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I really don't believe in that at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">So, my religion would be expressed in terms of how people should relate to one another and nothing to do with some superior being. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I'm a scientist and I don't believe in that at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">QUESTION:  Anything else you want to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">ANSWER:  Well, the only thing is that you can overcome anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">You at some point have to take responsibility for your own life, no matter how bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">If you do that, you won't be alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">If you persist in living in the past and saying that you can't do anything and nothing is going to work out because you went through this terrible thing, then you will remain stagnate and people will shy away from you and you'll just be a very lonely person. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I like to be with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I don't like to be alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">That's all I have to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">QUESTION:  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">ANSWER:  Thank you. (</span><span class="sentence" id="636">Viewing pictures)
ANSWER:  This is my mom and dad's wedding picture and I think that occurred in 1934 something like that, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">These are my fraternal grandparents, grandfather, grandmother, uncles, aunts. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">That was taken in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="639">It must have been around '34 or '35 because my father is no longer on that picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">He had moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">This is my maternal grandfather, my mom and dad, my mom's brother and his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">The baby on the old man's lap is myself and the three children that are standing are my cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">They are my mother's brother's children. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I assume, I was born in '36, it had to be, I was close to six months to a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">That's the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> where we stayed when we didn't make it to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">That was the place.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">QUESTION:  Weren't there a couple pictures on here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="648">ANSWER:  This is which is on the <span class="REGION">Belgium coast</span> and it must have been very shortly before. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">The one on the right is in which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where my mother and I spent the last year of the war approximately. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">This picture is the center 1s my grandfather and it's essentially many of the same people that appeared in that previous picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">So, it's my dad's brothers and sisters after the war after they got married and had children. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Conclusion of Interview. </span>
