<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Nesse, would you, for the record, identify yourself? </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Give us your name, your full name, and where you were born, please.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  Yes, my name is Nesse Godin. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I live in the <span class="REGION">Silver Spring area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">My maiden name was Galperin, Nesse Galperin. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I was born in 1928.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Tell us about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span> , and tell us about your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">What was it like for you growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siaulai</span> as a young child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  You see, when I grew up <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> was between the two wars-- First World War and Second World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">It was a democracy with a President, with a Cabinet; and all the people really lived nicely together with a little bit of anti-Semitism, but not to be beaten up or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Here and there, a Swastika on the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , on the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">But in general, Jewish people in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> lived pretty much comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I had a pretty nice childhood up to the age of 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  That sounds good. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">What did your parents do? </span><span class="sentence" id="16">What about your brothers and sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  Well, I did not have any sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I had two brothers older than me--one five years older, one seven years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">My parents had a <span class="BUILDING">dairy business</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">My parents were, you know, what we call Balabatisha (ph) people--not wealthy rich people but comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">My parents were involved in the community work. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Like my mother, especially; she was a person that believed that you have to be involved in helping other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And part of the community work was to take care of the sick, of the orphans, of the widows. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And that, my mother was involved with. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Her name was Sarah Galperin. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">You had to raise money. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">You closed your <span class="DLF">door</span> of your own <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and you went to your neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And when someone was in need, you went and asked them to contribute to help other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And I grew up in that background, knowing that you have to be kind and good; and I really did not understand what hatred was, or indifference. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I really did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I was raised with love in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Tell me about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , for you as a girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Many people think that Europe was like way back years ago, when they came, in the turn of the century. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Everybody has to understand that even in Europe progress was made. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">For instance, my city--30,000 people... You know, people laugh when I say "a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> "; but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span> was the second largest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">It was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> that was taken over--Vilna--by the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">But in that time, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunas</span> was a larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , was the capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> ; the next one was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span> --or as we Jewish people called it, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shavli</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And in Hebrew, we referred to it as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shavli</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We had a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , which was called <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium Bialik</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">It was a (unclear word) type of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , what as you started through kindergarten through <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">There was a <span class="BUILDING">Beth Sefer Chevra</span> for people who could not afford as much. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">There was a Yavner for very religious people who were ultra-orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Even in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , although everybody was orthodox, we did not have a conservative or reform. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">We just had <span class="BUILDING">orthodox synagogue</span> ; but we were Misnagdim, not Hasidim. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">What it means is, our people did not believe in the Rebbe, did not wear curlicues and the black clothing and the fur hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Our family looked pretty much like an American family. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">My father did not cover his head just to go to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> or to make a prayer. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So we had the <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> Yavner, we had a Fortshuler (ph) for people that were Yiddishkeit--you know, Bundistin [NB: socialists] that didn't believe in Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Then we had many <span class="BUILDING">cheders</span> where people just sent their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">They went to regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , to <span class="BUILDING">Lithuanian school</span> ; and then they went to learn customs and prayers in a <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  So you grew up this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Tell us in growing up what happened then, what happened, how old were you when the Germans came and what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  Also, I would like to remark [that] for a small--at this time--<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which is not so big, we had quite a few <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">We had all the time Yiddish Theater come; we had a Jewish paper, newspaper; we had Maccabee, which was a sport organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We have every type of Zionist organization from the right to the left existing in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">When I grew up, as I said, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> ; I happened to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasia Bialik</span> from <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> to the age of 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">At the age of 12, in 1940... You know, many people skipped that year. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Even when I go out to speak to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I'm giving just a half hour, I cannot go into detail about history. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But in 1940, <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> was occupied by the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And that's when we were not allowed to study Hebrew anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">All the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> had to study Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">At that point, the very wealthy of the community--the Burjui, as they called them--were deported to <span class="COUNTRY">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But ironically, these people lived through cold and hunger but nobody killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">They survived, and many of them came now to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">My family, as I told you before, were Balabatish--which is comfortable, but not very rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">So we were allowed to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And in our business, the Communists put in like an overseer; but my parents were still running the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Now, 1941, we heard before that in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> already things are being bad for the Jews--Jews are made to leave their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I, as a child at the age of 12, had firsthand information about it; because in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> came what we called Platim--runaways-- people that escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">My mother's first cousin, her name was Regina Vlafsia (ph); I can't recall her husband's first name--they were children of a family by the name of Fabilisski. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">They were manufacturers for cloth in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">6d_</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">They had a lot of money, and somehow they bought their way out to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And they came to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ; and they told us that they were all made to leave their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and relocate their particular family to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">This young couple did not know exactly what happened during that time, but we had gotten in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> --my aunt also in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> --some letters from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , assuming they were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> , from this great uncle of my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So we knew what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">But you don't think it will happen to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I'm telling you the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">You know, I make a smile with it, and I'm saying it because people don't realize that 1t can happen anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">If we don't learn from this part of history how it happened, it can happen anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We lived so nice in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> --Jewish people, non- Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">The children played together, our parents did business together. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">We didn't think that our own neighbors are not going to stand by us and help us at the time of need. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">In 1941, the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> in three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">You will see documentation shows it. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I was 13 years old--a little girl--but I remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I remember it well. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">My <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , they marched through in one night. </span><span class="sentence" id="88"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span> is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that stands from the main <span class="DLF">road</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">In every war, the armies had to pass through it; because the main <span class="DLF">road</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> had to pass this <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So that's why we saw the war going through. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">But we were not affected by this military occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">The military went through that night; no bombs fell, no people were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">They went on farther to fight the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">But they left behind the (unclear word) the Gestapo, the Nazi party, the special unit that were called...1 don't even know exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Einsatzgruppen, or whatever they were called at the time--to take care of the Jewish affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And their aim right away started like in any other <span class="NPIP">place</span> with different laws for Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Jewish people are not allowed to have businesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Jewish children cannot go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Jewish people are not allowed to go to buy food in the <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> but at certain hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">By the time we got to that <span class="BUILDING">store</span> to get the food, there was no food there. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">You know, they didn't have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freezers</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerators</span> like here. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Small <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Every day the farmer brought the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So right away, we suffered hunger already, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">The law came out [that] Jewish women were not allowed to be pregnant, they had to have abortions. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">No future for the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Every Jew had to wear a Star of David in front and in back of the garment. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Many people say to me, "Why did you have to wear it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Two reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">One, a symbol of shame. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But the most important: why did they want us to wear it? </span><span class="sentence" id="112">An ID. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">They wanted to make sure they know exactly where the Jew is. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">The punishment for not wearing this... Specific[ally], we called it the "yellow letter." </span><span class="sentence" id="115">We didn't even call it a star. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">It was a Star of David; but the "patch of yellow," that's what we called it in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We didn't say Magen David, or yellow Magen David. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">The "yellow letter," we called it. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It was a "yellow letter," we called it; it was a patch that was the ID. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">If you didn't wear it, the punishment was death. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Now, you think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Children many times say, "Why did you have to put it on? </span><span class="sentence" id="123">You could go around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ; they would think you are Christian." </span><span class="sentence" id="124">But unfortunately, not too many friends around us. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">The same people that were our neighbors deceived us, reported on us, showed where a Jew was. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">If you didn't put on, they would say, "This is a Jew." </span><span class="sentence" id="127">They killed you for not wearing that patch, that star. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">The next process was, they started to grab Jewish men off the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , out of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , out of the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Allegedly, they have to clean the city of war damage. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">The Rabbis, the scholars--a thousand men were put into the <span class="BUILDING">city jails</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We had two <span class="BUILDING">jails</span> ; a white <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and a red <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">That's how it was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">The red Deturmen and the white Deturmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Because one was painted white, the other was red bricks. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">They put them into those <span class="BUILDING">jails</span> , the most terrible Lithuanian sadists taking care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Who were they? </span><span class="sentence" id="137">The same policemen of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> that walked around. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">We didn't have even traffic. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">They just walked around to make sure everything is in order. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">They joined the evil cause. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">They put on arm bands, they helped to get rid of the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">They had 1,000 men in that <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , with promises they are going to take them to labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And we believed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">You don't think you don't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">You believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Well, some people ran and they tried to get people out of that <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">But nobody succeeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">These thousand men were taken out to a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> near our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> by the name of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kuzhi</span> , where they were made to dig their own <span class="DLF">graves</span> , they were made to get undressed naked, they were shot and they were covered with earth. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">How did we know exactly what happened there? </span><span class="sentence" id="150">The farmers in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">They came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and told us exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I, as a child, remember those farmers that used to bring milk to our <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> , to our <span class="BUILDING">dairy store</span> , doing like this (motioning), telling the earth shook over the so-called <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Why did it shake? </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Many, many people fell into that <span class="DLF">hole</span> and were not even shot to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">They covered them with earth, and they suffocated. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">There are many incidents. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I know a young man who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> who ran away from a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> by the name of Aniksht. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">In this particular <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the Germans and the Lithuanians were so drunk that they didn't cover the <span class="DLF">hole</span> that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">The only time when people tell you they run away from those <span class="DLF">holes</span> was if you were injured and they didn't cover the <span class="DLF">hole</span> that night -- they were too tired or didn't want to bother -- then they had a chance to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And also, many times, when I talk about escaping you have to understand to escape you need a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to escape to. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Everybody wanted to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">But if your neighbor doesn't let you in, or if you try to run to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and while you are running somebody points a finger--"Here is a Jew"--and you are killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So you wonder does it pay to escape, or maybe I should wait in the community for a week, a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">The war will end, and I will live. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So after we heard what happened to this thousand men, we knew the Holocaust was happening to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">This is when in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> our own Jewish Community Council, marvelous leaders, marvelous men. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And as I told you before, my mother was connected. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Because she was on this committee of helping the poor and the widows, and so she knew firsthand from the leaders what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">They decided to go to the Christian clergy to beg them to help to save our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Those Priests, Roman Catholic, they were marvelous men; but when our community council came to beg them to save our people they said "We are afraid to get involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">We will help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">By helping you, they will kill us." </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Can you imagine, human beings were afraid to help other human beings? </span><span class="sentence" id="174">You know, many times we hear all these beautiful statements made by Pastor Niemoller, and other statements, how sorry they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Yes, you are sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">But isn't it easier to be there for other human beings when they need you, than after the fact to say you are sorry? </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Now at that point -- I know if I could sit with you, Linda, and talk with you for weeks of what went through in this short period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Because they said they are going to transfer all the Jews of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> by the name of Jagga (ph), Jagerod (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="179">They said, you know, there we will be able to stay and we will be able to live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">But our Council felt if they are going to move us from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> ...we are not going to move us from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> , we are not going to be in such good shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">We will be better off if we can stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">At that point, you know, there were different rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Some people said that our Jewish Community Council persuaded some Lithuanians to help us to convince that we could be in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I heard from my mother that she said and I saw that we gave gold and silver and diamonds to give actually to the (unclear word) and the Gestapo to bribe them so we could stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> , they wouldn't take us away right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">We will make shoes and boots for the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We had many shoe and leather factories, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span> was famous for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">People that know about that <span class="REGION">area</span> , Lithuanian was famous about beef and cattle, so we had a lot of leather. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">So I don't know exactly what was the persuasion, the good people that intervened with the money, maybe everything together, that they decided yes, they are not going to take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jagga</span> , Jaggerod (ph), they are going to let us stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> but not 1n our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">A <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">At the beginning was formed two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Many times when I go out to talk I don't go into detail because a half hour, today we have time. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">There was two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> , one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> on one side was across from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> of Frenklfabrik, a <span class="BUILDING">leather factory</span> ,’ was called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaukazas ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Then, on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> near the red <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , was the ' After Chaim Frenkl. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Founded by him in 1879. </span><span class="sentence" id="195"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trakai ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">There was two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> --four square blocks each, or five; small <span class="REGION">area</span> --and that's where the Jews were supposed to relocate. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Now, you couldn't take your bundles and move into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">It was a special commission that came to every <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">The commission consisted of Germans and Lithuanians, because the Lithuanians showed them where is the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> and the little secretaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Now, I will share with you what happened in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> --firsthand information. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">My two brothers--one older five years than me, one seven years older than me--so one was 18, one was 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I was 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And my parents, my mother was at that point 43 and my father was maybe 45...yes, 45. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And they came with commission, they looked around our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ; and they told my parents how many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , how many pillows, how many clothing we can take to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and how many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">They issued four certificates. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was originally for people to work--not for children, not for sick, not for elderly. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I was 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">They didn't need me. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I remember it very well, how I felt when I saw I was going to be separated from my family at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">My mother succeeded to bribe the Lithuanian Secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">How did it happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="212">As a child, I had a ceramic cat where I used to save my money that I got for Chanukah, for my birthday--silver money. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And my mother said to the secretary, quietly, "This is full of silver money. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">If you will ask for it and I will have to give it to you, please leave a blank certificate--the fifth one--on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And as they were walking out, this commission...the Secretary said, "I want this little cat." </span><span class="sentence" id="216">My mother said, "That's my little girl's. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">She loves it.". </span><span class="sentence" id="218">The German said "Give it to her." </span><span class="sentence" id="219">You understand, how she could bribe -- it's important to know this little fact -- and he walked out with a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">But I remember my mother counting those certificates. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Four were there with names filled in; a fifth blank certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">My parents filled it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Now, to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> you just had to show the certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">If you had the certificate, they let you in through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So about 5,000 people got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">We had 10,000 Jewish people in the two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">The people that did not get this yellow certificate, I believe it's about 3,500. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">The <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , the elderly, the sick, the children from many families, and many, many people that came to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> last and there was no more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> --they were put into the <span class="BUILDING">city synagogues</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">shulen</span> , as we called it, within the <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">With hunger, no water; they were begging for food, they were begging for them to be saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">People were trying -- our Jewish Community Council, who were wonderful people, they tried so hard to save. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">They were saying already, "Okay, take them to this little city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jagga</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="232">They thought at least they will live; because we had already the 1,000 men experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">These people were killed just like the thousand men in another <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , 3,500 of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So by the time the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed, I don't know exactly whether it was August or September, I don't remember; but I know [by the] High Holidays, we were already--my family--in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Half of our population was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">So, that's how the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">You know, feel free to interject or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Now, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ... I will tell you how it was when I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">All the working people went to work in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Girls like me--at the age of 13, you see, I had a certificate to go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">But I wasn't on the master list, you understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="242">The same way, I was smuggled in. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">People succeeded to smuggle in some sick, some elderly, some children even younger than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">But you were not on the master list, master list or whatever, you didn't get food. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">You didn't get the rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So your family shared with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Let's say we got X amount of bread, or...I don't remember how much it was at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Five people ate of the ration of four; and some people, four people ate of the ration of two. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So this is... People have to understand that even as little as the ration was, if you were lucky enough to have your child or your elderly with you at that point, they didn't get food. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Your ration of food became smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , girls like me had to take care of little children. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Many families right away tried to make some little <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , whether it was a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> or in a <span class="DLF">wall</span> ; because we saw that things look bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , selection upon selection, they came for no reason whatever to take people because they heard the rumor there are children in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , there are sick in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">How did they get in? </span><span class="sentence" id="255">We don't want to feed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So they came to take them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I lived through two years in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I don't know how I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">How I have hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">One time I remember -- the Jewish police in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> were wonderful, they ran through and warned us that the SS is coming to take people so quickly hide, do whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">So I was supposed to get out my <span class="DLF">door</span> and go into the little <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> where you keep wood, that's where my <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">As I was pulling the <span class="DLF">door</span> to open up I felt pressure on the <span class="DLF">door</span> from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and I remember not breathing but I could hear my heart pound and the German opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , the SS man, and he looked 1n and he said to his friend or whatever, his associate, "This <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> is empty." </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And he closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> behind him. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I tell you many incidents like this that I was saved at that time, really by the grace of God. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Two years like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">When I was 15, I was allowed to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Now, there were many ways of people being put on a list. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Let's say they took a selection of people, they took -- sometime they didn't even know how many they took -- they took 120, and the list was 100. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">20 people, kids that got a little older or the sick that got a little healthier could go out to work instead. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">So this is when I was 15, I went out to work instead. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">So this is when I was 15, I went out to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">At that time, in 1943, they did not need two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">We were living already spacey so many people were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">They combined both <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> together, just the one on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trakai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaukazas ghetto</span> was closed completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">We were transferred to the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">A little bit people, there were too many of them, they took out some men and women. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And we thought they were going to kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">But no, they took them to a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> --I really don't remember the name--to work, to make turf. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I don't know what turf is. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">It is a material that comes from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> , and you press it for burn purposes, for heating purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I don't really know what you call that composite of earth and weeds. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">We used it a lot for heating purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So they took them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">We came in 1943 into the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">We were nine people in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> : two uncles and aunts and our family [of] five. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">We were still together, that many of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And I recall that time, many times to my friends, I would say, "I remember it as a better time." </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And they say, "Why was it a better time?" </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And I said, "I still was surrounded with my family, which was pretty lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Many uncles, many aunts, many cousins, grandparents, were dead at that time--that lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> around our <span class="REGION">area</span> , and in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">But my immediate family was still there." </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I tell you, really, I'm sitting here and trying to think of certain things to share with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I think I forgot to tell you like in 1942 we had a hanging in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">A man was hung because he was caught at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> with some bread and a few eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Somebody said he had a few cigarettes on him, somebody said he didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">But documented incident, because as you went out to work all through the year there were kind Lithuanian people, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I really wants to share that and admire these people that wanted to give you a little bread for you to eat and wanted to give a little type of other food also to take back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">But it's worthwhile talking about it because as you come back from work they frisked you bodily to make sure you are not smuggling in ammunition or food. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Many guards were bribed. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Many, many guards, you know especially Lithuanian guards, you would bribe them with a fur coat or whatever so if nobody was around they looked the other way and let you bring in that food, so we had a little more food to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">But if let's say German Commission or another guard came that wasn't bribed, they came quickly and they grabbed the people, they beat them terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">But that one incident this man's name was Mussevitsky, Batsalom Mussevitsky, he was a young man, he had a wife and a child in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">He was caught with that few eggs or half a loaf of bread but very little, maybe he had a few cigarettes, I really don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">He was taken to the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">The Jewish Community Council was called and they were told they are holding a big criminal, the Jews have to learn a lesson, no food is in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">The following Sunday a gallow was to be built in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">What was a gallow in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="309">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , some stick hammered to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> going this way like an L, upside-down L, a cord hanging there. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Two men sitting there, they were supposed to be the henchmen, Jewish men. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">How they were picked, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">They ordered that we have to provide these henchmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">We all had to gather in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I remember very well a dozen SS men with guns outstretched like this went in with this one criminal that wanted to bring a little food for his child, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">People say why didn't he run away, many times people say why didn't he run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I said three hijackers hijack a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> with hundreds of people, three guns against hundreds of people and they are in control. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Imagine dozens of guns 1n control of one prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Well, this man was marched in like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">He walked over to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">He said to the two men "Thou shalt not kill," you know in Yiddish, "I will do it myself." </span><span class="sentence" id="320">He hopped on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> , they did not even have a chance like you know in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> they tie their hands back or they put a cover on their face. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">He hopped, he put a string of his own, the loop you know over his, the noose, whatever it's called, over his neck, and to the assassin, the Gestapo, he said you are not going to win a war by killing me" and somebody pushed or he pushed a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> from under his feet and I remember his body dangling like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I remember it so. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Linda, it was terrible times. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">You know, I always try to control myself, not to be too emotional because otherwise if I get too emotional, I cannot bring the message. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">You know, you know, this what people have to think about. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I say over, I say this man resisted the Germans, I always say there is a spiritual resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">If you didn't fight back, if you didn't punch it or whatever, I say we live the extra day we resisted them. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">They wanted us dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> there was sign, "Yiden"--Jews--"Don't despair. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Live an extra day. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">We will overcome it." </span><span class="sentence" id="333">The hope we gave each other all through, that's all I remember as a child saying (unclear phrase), in spite of the enemy, we will overcome it, we will live, we will be free. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">So you can imagine this punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Now go back to 1943 where I was before. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">When we got into that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> when they condensed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> , we got a little more food. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Things looked kind of better. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Everybody thought, said gee, they start to treat us a little better. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I was working at that time in the <span class="BUILDING">war hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">My job was to put wood into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> so the German soldiers would keep warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">You know we had a job, we had to do our job. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">That morning when I came to my commander to go to work -- 1t was exactly November 5, 1942, when I went with my group to go out to work -- we saw outside of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ghetto trucks</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> covered with canvas, we were told we cannot go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I remember running back to my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">My mother put two dresses on me one dress on top of another. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">You see people said maybe they don't let you take along a bundle. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">To be safe, a little bread in the pocket, a coin in the pocket, we were prepared to be deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">A half hour or whatever, I don't remember exactly, maybe 20 minutes, it was a short time, the Jewish police were running through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> saying a mistake was made in the order, all the working people should leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Chaos. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">People did not know what's better. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Some people said it's better to hide in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malina</span> , in the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malina</span> was called the hiding place during those times, a Malina -- some people said it's better to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">The Jewish police ran through and said whoever can go out to work -- we had marvelous people that were Jewish police in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">You won't hear not one had word about the leadership and the Jewish police in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span> after a certain point because after a certain point them to cover other people that the Germans appointed, they brought them from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , 1t was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">But as long as we had our own people from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> it was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">So they said it's better to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I remember leaving that day for work but all day long we wondered. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">What were the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> doing near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">At one point in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> we worked with a german, he was from a building commander that was called Ortek (ph) and he was a civilian and he was pretty nice man, he gave us sometime a little bread but he had nothing to do with the security or taking care of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">His job was building whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">So we asked this man to go near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and see what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">When he came back he said nothing happened but we saw he was pale, we saw he was bothered. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">But he said nothing, there was nothing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">That evening when we were coming back from work, blocks and blocks away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , Linda, we heard cries, such cries I hope nobody will hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">What happened in the ghetto of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> on November 5, 1943, SS and Gestapo with the help of Ukranians, Ukranians that left the Russians and joined the evil cause so many of them just came -- so many of them just came and joined to kill Jewish people, 1t was terrible time -- they went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they found every <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , they went in, they broke every dish, every pillow, made every single person come to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> near that <span class="NPIP">place</span> where you gathered for work, all the children, all the elderly, all the sick, all the babies that were born illegally in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">You see, they told us we were not allowed to be pregnant but women got pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">They stayed in their little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">If they were caught in the selection, then they were caught, but if they were not caught they had their baby in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">But on that day not one child was spared. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">At the <span class="DLF">gate</span> a selection to the right and to the left, a thousand children. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Five hundred elderly and sick and a few hundred healthy and strong, including two men from our Jewish Community Council because these two men said to them "Where are you taking these children?" </span><span class="sentence" id="370">They said "To a better <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , you are welcome to come and check it out" and they put them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">We did not know then where they were taken to. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">We honestly believed that they were taken to another camp where they have children. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">They said these children need supervision, you all go to work, we will take care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">After the war we found out they were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> where they were gassed and cremated, they did not even keep them there one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">The Rabbis told me that I have to keep Yarzeit on that day that my father was taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">My father was taken with that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">My father was 47 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">He was among the nice Healthy, strong, tall people. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Can you imagine how I feel even sharing with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="380">You know, Linda, I am talking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">I am giving you just my own but by now, 1989, we know what happened all over Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">The life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> after the children selection was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">No laughter, no crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">My mother used to say to me, "Nessele, don't go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> after you come from work. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">The neighbor lost a child one year younger than you. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">She will hurt." </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Can you imagine -- you know European people had a lot of children -- can you imagine in one day from a mother six children, eight children, you came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">We were a lucky family, just my father was taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Can you me saying a lucky family after they killed my father but we were a lucky family because on that day every family lost dear ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Not just one, two, four, six, eight people of a family went on that terrible day. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">So the life was terrible after that, 1t was just terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">They were trying -- I don't remember exactly details -- they were trying, I mean the Germans, the SS, the Gestapo, make some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camps</span> where they thought the workers could work separately. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">They thought they would get rid of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Then they thought they still need some people that should stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">There was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that was making the shoes, a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that was making some brushes. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">So they left some people in those <span class="BUILDING">workshops</span> for a little bit longer but us in June of 1944, they took us to a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> for deportation to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">We had to walk about 10 kilometers to this specific railroad because in our city bombs fell already. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">The last few days that we were in the ghetto Russian bombs fell in our city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siaulai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">We were so glad to see the bombs but quite a few fell in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> too and quite a few people died and at that point we said already maybe they are luckier that they died of a Russian bomb than what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">So we were taken to this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> by foot, we had to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I remember that walk very well because my mother at that time had an injury in her leg and she walked on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> and she had injured her knees and she couldn't walk to well and they said whoever cannot walk, whoever is sick or weak should stay and some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> will bring them to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , and my mother, like a <span class="DLF">pool</span> , stood in that group saying -- they couldn't see the injury, it was so tight, it was covered -- she said "I cannot walk, I would like to go on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> " and a German said to her, "What do you think, run, you are still young, go to work," you know he saved her life because we never saw the rest of the people that were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">We were told after the war that they were put into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in one of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and you know like in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , they dynamited the <span class="REGION">area</span> , dynamited them. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Us, they put into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> for a journey to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> by the name of Stutthof. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I'm going to tell you exactly about the ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">We were in there -- they didn't count you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">As we came to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , it said capacity, how many cows or horses you can have in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , but they didn't say capacity, how many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">They shoved you in like pushed you and pushed you. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">They said stoop down, they didn't say stretch out, you know like this and with your knees just up and you try to take a little bit more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and people say "Let me in, if I stay <span class="NPIP">outside</span> they will shoot me." </span><span class="sentence" id="409">So people really squeezed in to let other people in. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">It was so crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">I remember having my feet over my mother, my brother on top to stretch out. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">A bucket in the corner for sanitation purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">We each have a little package. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">They said take along your valuables and a little food that you had still in your <span class="INT_SPACE">ghetto room</span> and some water. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">In my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> we had plenty water because we were on the outskirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where there were <span class="DLF">wells</span> so we had no problem with water. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the only good part that was in our ghetto of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siaulai</span> we could keep clean because there was plenty of water and we had enough water to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">So as we went to those <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , you know nobody had thermoses like here, you had an open dish or some dish you used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> to buy some milk in a little container that you filled with water and you took. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Let's say you were a family -- we were, thank God, four of a family still alive, my two brothers, my mother and myself, but in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> was just one brother, my mother and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">As we were getting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> we saw my brother said to us, "Don't get excited, your brother is not dead, he escaped." </span><span class="sentence" id="420">He told my mother that some nice Lithuanian man that we knew said to him, "If you have opportunity somehow to escape, do so, and don't come to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , come in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , there is a <span class="BUILDING">smokehouse</span> and go into that <span class="BUILDING">smokehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Every night I will put out some food for you and you go let's say 10 feet or 15 feet and get that food but if they catch you, you snuck in, don't tell them I let you in." </span><span class="sentence" id="422">How my brother had this opportunity to escape we did not know for many years but afterwards we found our that as we were being taken from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , instead of going out to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , he went back into the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where he worked and since it was a Saturday he crawled in one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machinery</span> and on Sunday when the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was closed, that's when he got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">But we did not know at that point, just he told my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">He didn't want even me to know or my brother to know that he has this opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Look, in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , in that thing we were three already of the family, we were left three, and it was just the most terrible thing that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">You cannot imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Everybody is really looking out for themselves because you want to stretch your foot out, your foot falls asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">You try to put it on somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">The person doesn't like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">You know their foot is asleep too. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Some People were kind and said okay, put your foot and you told them put your feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Some were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">It was a terrible journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">We traveled three or four days. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">The few survivors of my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> , when I see them and I ask them, "Do you remember how many days we traveled?" </span><span class="sentence" id="436">They say no, three or four days. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And this is why many times I tell you the I say the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">By the time we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> , we were a mess, we were dirty, we couldn't reach that bucket to make. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Many people had to make under and even if you could hold it until you went to the bucket, the person next to you, if they made, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> moved, it moves. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">The stench was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Some people told me in some of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> people suffocated. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I did not see so I don't share it with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I remember when they opened those <span class="DLF">doors</span> we thought it was <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> but we came to <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">You know, I as a survivor feel so bad when I see books or even memorials that say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> , where is others and others and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">You know the last memorial in Yom Ha'Shoah I saw Herman Taube read the Kaddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Where is others and others and others? </span><span class="sentence" id="447">You know the last memorial in Yom Ha'Shoah I saw that they included Herman Taube read Kaddish, the service for the dead -- they include more and more <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">You as a historian know, over 200 <span class="NPIP">killing places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Stutthof, many people lost their life. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">As soon as we arrived, divided, men this way, women that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Our packages, the little bundles taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I remember my mother saying to me -- I wore a watch at that time- she said "My kind, my child, take off the watch and put it in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> so the Germans wouldn't have it." </span><span class="sentence" id="453">The little we knew that the next day they go with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plow</span> and they take out all the gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">So everybody like whispered, take off your jewelry and stick it in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> so they wouldn't get it, you know a form of resistance, a form of fighting back. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And then a little bit later they said you go here and you go here to me and my mother, because she was 46 and I was 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">She was considered old. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I didn't see her for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">You know, she was taken to another <span class="NPIP">side</span> which I wasn't too sure whether she was taken to be killed or to another side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">My group of women from the age of 16 to 25, we were taken into a very large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , group by group, I don't know 200 or whatever, I really don't know exactly the count. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">We were told to get completely undressed naked, the guards standing around and around. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">You know when I think of that moment I still remember how I did not know which <span class="NPIP">part</span> to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Should I cover the top, should I cover the bottom. (</span><span class="sentence" id="463">unclear word) bending over and they laughing and singing songs and making fun of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">We were in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for the longest time. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Still I understand we were lucky because many, many people stood <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">We were in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Them they said to us, "Go in there." </span><span class="sentence" id="469">It said <span class="INT_SPACE">shower room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470"><span class="INT_SPACE">Shower room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">They gave us a piece of soap, white soap, thin soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I seldom like to talk about it but today I feel I must say it. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">We went in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , water came, we soaped ourselves, we rinsed ourselves, we walked out the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">After the war, documentation shows Reef (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Soap was produced in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> -- I have a book at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where it gives even the formula -- and I keep on thinking was that piece of soap that I bathed with, was a drop of human fat in there’. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">How do we survivors feel? </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I was lucky, I got out the other <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">How * See Hilberg, The Destruction of Eurpoean Jews, p. 67. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">many of our people went into those <span class="INT_SPACE">showers rooms</span> and never walked out?’ </span><span class="sentence" id="480">It said <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">shower room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">They were gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">We went out the other <span class="DLF">door</span> , we were told for medical examination, oral, internal, rectal examination. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">It's time for us top have a discussion but you want to ask me different things at the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">°**Gas chambers at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Tape #2
QUESTION:  Nesse, you were telling us about coming out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">ANSWER:  Yes, we came out from the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Also don't forget we didn't get a towel. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Sometimes people think you got into a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , you got a towel. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">We were standing there and shivering and it was cold and they pushed us with the guns you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">It wasn't just walking slowly or whatever, you constantly had to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">You know they didn't say walk, you ran from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Run, run, run. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I remember the water was dripping and you walked into that other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and there were like in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gynecologist tables</span> like this and everybody had to hop on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And can you imagine, I was 16, I never had an examination, internal examination, I didn't know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">So they checked you. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">I don't even think that people were doctors it looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">What were they looking for? </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">They were looking for a diamond, a piece of gold, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Some people hid it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">You know many people thought they will need a piece of gold, they will swallow it and a few days later they had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">You know many times you may wonder when somebody says I had a gold coin with me and the people don't really would like to tell you exactly how they brought it. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">But many people did it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> you came, they gave you this medical examination, opened your mouth, they looked in your <span class="INT_SPACE">rectum</span> , they looked in your front to make sure you don't have -- in the mouth if you had gold caps they didn't even (unclear word). </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Some came, they took your number. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">There they had a man that pulled it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">You stood there, if they were in the mood, they pulled it out right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">A bucket full of gold caps. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">They took it from the dead, they took it from the living. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Then you went into another like <span class="NPIP">outside</span> -- this was already almost <span class="NPIP">outside</span> like with a little cover and they threw a bundle of clothing to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">What was in a bundle? </span><span class="sentence" id="512">A dress, a pair of underwear, and they gave you a pair of shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Another question. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Did they say you wear size 7 or 8 or 5 or 10? </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Do you know that even in our group by some mistake we all got the shoes, our own shoes, and that was very unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Somebody made a mistake somewhere because I didn't get my shoes but you know they threw to us the shoes and all of a sudden people said "Give me, those are my shoes, give me, those are my shoes" and people started to exchange until you found your shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">But let's say somebody -- I had a pair of boots and it was summer, nobody wanted those boots but I wanted them and I got them back so I was lucky I had these boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">So you had a dress, a pair of underpants and a pair of shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Now the family is taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Me, 16 years old, standing there surrounded with some women from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> but alone, all alone, very different than this nine people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">ghetto room</span> surrounded with electric wires, guards going around and around, you are scared, people are whispering from one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and another what's happening there. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">The next thing what they do, they take us into a big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to register. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">You know you think they took your family, they took your clothing, one more thing, your gorgeous name. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">16 years old I was prisoner 54015 in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Why was I prisoner there? </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="526">and still I'm lucky, I bring out always I'm lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">They didn't tattoo it on my arm, they gave it on a piece of shmata [Yidd: "rag"], on a piece of rag on my clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , all my friends that survived, the few of them have it on their arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I had in on a piece of cloth. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">From there, they assigned you in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">The particular <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> I was assigned to had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bins</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">The <span class="BUILDING">Stutthof</span> was being rebuilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">When we came, at some point they had old <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">They were doing some new <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , a new section when I got into that side, between each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was two rows of electric wires--not one, but two rows, like this, between the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">men's camp</span> ...between the new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And from there, across these wires, I saw my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So I knew she was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">That's when I found out she was still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">But she was...like people that in case they don't need you no more, you are next to be killed, on that <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">In the morning, they woke us up 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">They called it "appell"--roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">When they said, "Roll call!", </span><span class="sentence" id="542">you had to be <span class="NPIP">outside</span> like this (snapping fingers), and lined up in a specific row behind a specific people. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And if you didn't know these people, too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">You had to recognize them, and be there at the right <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Let's say, if you are in the 20th row in the middle, you had to find your row and stand there. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Many a time I sat half of the night on the <span class="DLF">window</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , when they say roll call, to jump out and be <span class="NPIP">outside</span> because they running with whips and with guns and hit us so hard, we should go out quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">You stood there for hours and hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Why you stood there, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">They counted and they counted and they counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">They wanted to make sure nobody escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">You couldn't escape from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">You know very well very few recorded -- the only way you could escape is maybe you were sent out for a labor or you had some connection somehow, but very few. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">The only people that were missing were people that died in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> or somebody decided to commit suicide and jumped on the wires. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">They counted and finally maybe 6:00 o'clock they said, line up, we will give you black coffee, it was some black drink- and a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">The piece of bread was very tiny, I don't know, believe me you could eat it now, it's like half a sandwich, you know, just the bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Then you were assigned something to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">In my particular <span class="REGION">area</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> they said today you go clean the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , tomorrow let's say you sweep the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Every day if they needed 50 woman, 100 women to do certain chores, sweep the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I will share with you one of these labors. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">One day we were taken out, about 50 women, and with about a dozen SS men with the guns outstretched and we had to walk out of the sight of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and there is an empty <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> with a pile of shoes, mountain of shoes, big shoes, little shoes, tall shoes, tall, old shoes, new shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">We were told to sort them. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">This was a special command to sort shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">We had to sort them, tie them in pairs, put them in bundles, ladies' shoes separate, men's shoes separate, children's shoes separate, and we were working, and on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was a polish prisoner of war camp and he said to us "Jewish lady, Jiduvkas (ph), you know what the shoes are? </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Those are the shoes from the people that perished, your people in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Can you imagine you touch a shoe and somebody tells you the people were killed and you wonder 1s that your aunt's shoe, your cousin's shoe, your baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">They become people, not shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I tell you from my heart the next day when they didn't tell me to go to the shoes, I was so lucky, I was so happy to go to clean the latrines, I was happier not to have to go to that job. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Can you imagine after our people were dead we had to sort shoes, we had to sort clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Many people had to drag bodies from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another all through those years, all through those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">In the evening they gave us some kind of a vegetable peel soup and you had to be in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">When you were in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> you had an opportunity to talk to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">The Germans did not go into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> just like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">The person in charge was a polish women. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> mostly Polish people were in charge, they were the Kapos, nobody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">They were prisoners or criminals or whatever, they were in charge of this section and if they came in, if they were in a good mood they didn't say nothing if you were chatting. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">But otherwise you couldn't chat, you know, you had to be very careful, and that's when you found out from other people what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Let's say if I came back from that day from the shoe sorting, I could tell what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Many times people came back that sorted clothing 1n the clothing and they found little notes that people said we came from this and this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , we were here, we don't know where we are being taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Many people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> were brought from <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Estonia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Most of the baltic countries came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So we knew indirect information. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">In the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> or in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that you went in, if there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> you saw inscribed everywhere the word Gedenk (ph), remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">You know, I live now with the ringing in my ears of remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Everybody, when we sat down the only discussion was if ever somebody survives, please tell the world what happened here. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">If somebody succeeds to go in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or be among the free world or go out for labor, please tell what happened, please tell the world what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">We kept on thinking that nobody knows in the whole world what was happening to us because you know first we said "oh, we will wear the yellow star, a star, two three days, a week, a month, the war will end" but here I am talking already 1944, three years already. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">By that point I was already skinny, 16 year old girl, looked horrible, I looked maybe like 40. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> , when I was there by myself you know with many nice Jewish women but no family, nobody, I didn't have a cousin, no one there with me, a few women from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> , a woman came over to me and said to me they don't really keep children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Why did she say that? </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Every day when we were given the food, if there was a little food left tin that big bucket that they carried the food to us, the Polish Capo used to say children under 16 can get double food but under 16 were not allowed to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">So everybody was afraid to march out. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">You were hungry but I didn't say I want more food. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">You didn't have a birth certificate, it's your word against theirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">He used to come schlep me out, drag me out and another maybe dozen kids that were already 16, maybe some were, saying you can get more food, why don't you come out -- maybe some were not -- saying you can get more food, why don't you come out, you are under 16, and if I said I'm 16, he beat me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">So this woman said to me, "it's bad, it's bad, you know, they won't keep you alive here" and I looked at her with my eyes open, you know I was so scared, and she said to me "Maidela, little girls, try to go out for labor, they do take people out for labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">If you could get out for labor, maybe you would survive, little girl Meidela (ph), little girl," you know like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">She didn't know my name, I never knew her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">One night I saw women lining up in the corner of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , they were given a blanket and dish for food and with my smart -- you know, what do you know at 16 in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from the age of 13 to 16? -- </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I said they are given a blanket and a dish for food, it must be for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">You know how many Jewish people went to death with a blanket and a dish for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">So I stood in this <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">The woman said stand on your tip toes to look taller, pinch your cheeks to look osier, and you know I succeeded to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="603">That night we left, 5,000 women. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I remember they took us over a little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> -- I don't know the name of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> -- by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Somebody said that many people were drowned in that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> but I don't know, you know how people talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Maybe there is documentation on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I think it was the elbe maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And they divided us a thousand in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , a thousand pass by, they divide it, thousand, they divide it. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So all the women from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> were divided like 10 before me so I found myself in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> just with 10 people from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Other wonderful people, Jewish women, nice, but not even a friend from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">All of a sudden I found myself no family, no neighbors, no people that you know, not even a familiar face. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Now, the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that I was in was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malken</span> [Pol: Ma ki].* </span><span class="sentence" id="613">The camp that I worked and many people worked as I did from that period that were taken from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> ; we were put into <span class="BUILDING">canvas tents</span> , that was our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">We slept on straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">The job was to dig giant <span class="DLF">trenches</span> , <span class="DLF">holes</span> for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian tanks</span> to fall in. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">We were so weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">The food, again, so little. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">In the morning, the same procedure like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> : Up early, they counted you, they gave you the black coffee with a little bit of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">In the morning -- evening a little bit of soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Sometime they switched it off and they didn't give nothing in the morning, they just gave the black coffee and at night you got your ration of bread and the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">So imagine if you got in the evening your ration of bread and the soup, you think you are going to save your little bread for the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I especially used to think I'm so hungry all day, just a little black coffee, I'm going to eat that soup, that water, and eat one bite of the bread, and the next bite I will tear off a little piece of my blanket and I wrapped it and I put it in the straw that I slept on. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">In the morning my bread was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And I cried, I cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">A woman next to me said "Nessele, why are you crying, Nessele?" -- </span><span class="sentence" id="626">She knew my name -- I said I had a little bit of bread, I put it in the straw underneath my head and a mouse must have come. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">You there were * Subcamp of Stutthof. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Women only. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Opened April 1944 and closed January 28, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">plenty of mice and rats. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">She knew there were hungry people that ate the bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">She said "Child, give me your little bread, I will put in my bosom and I will give it to you in the morning." </span><span class="sentence" id="633">You know whenever we got the bread at night and I didn't eat it, I gave it to Mrs. Feivish (ph), may she rest in peace -- that was her name -- and as she handed that piece of bread to me in the morning, she saved my life maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">You know, I'm telling you these things today because people don't understand how human we stayed in this inhumane situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I want to bring out this little things that people don't understand, people cannot understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">As much as we survivors talk, you know we tried to tell the fact, this one killed, this one did, but I want to bring this out Linda, you know it's very important you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we dug those <span class="DLF">holes</span> , we finished one <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">They kept on moving us, that's why we stayed in those <span class="BUILDING">canvas tents</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="639">It was convenient for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">They had <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> made out of veneer you know for food and also that were prefabricated that you could quickly unscrew and move on. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Like this we went into two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malken</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dérbeck</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="642">In those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , they did not have to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">We started to die...die of starvation and diseases. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">In the morning, we got up, our hair was frozen to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> on that straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Many people said oh, they cut their hair in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> , they didn't cut our hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">It was more terrible, because we didn't have water to wash with. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And when you have hair on you, it gets infested with lice; and with lice brings diseases. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">By the time came October, November of 1944, it was a mess--walking skeletons with wounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">We looked horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">At one point, at that time, they brought certain kinds of <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Not <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">It was like to hold horses--a round wooden thing that they put up for us to be in. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Not in the <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> , because we were doing work so they felt that we are still useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">So they gave us this wooden <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ; and wherever one horse had to stand was five women lying there on the straw--no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , not a change of clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">You know, Linda, I > Also a subcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> , for women only. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">think that about six months I had not taken off my clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">There was no reason to take it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">There was no water to wash with, there was no change of clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And then you were afraid to take it off, because maybe some person that doesn't have a dress is going to take it, or your blanket or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">You know people in need, you have to understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">We stayed there until January 1945, in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ...in those <span class="REGION">areas</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malken</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorbeck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">There was another <span class="NPIP">place</span> that we were moved, but I don't remember the name.</span><span class="sentence" id="664">° It was three separate <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Then one morning, we were woken up very early, maybe 3:00 o'clock at night, we were told to line up and take everything that we have in that little <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">We were leaving the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">We looked, we looked for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , there was nothing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="668">March, a march. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">It was called the Death March. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">You know, we marched day and night this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">During the day we walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">You had to stop one time, let's say you had to go the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , you had to go at that time to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Now, if you wanted to go another time to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">If you stopped to stay in the back, you were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Whoever stayed behind was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">We heard all the time shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Also as we walked we saw many, many human beings face down with a bullet in the back in the snow and we saw that they were inmates like us because they were skinny, they wore prisoner garb, we could see it was Jewish people with their stars and with their numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Now, you know, we went through it was the <span class="REGION">Danzig area</span> --you know, exactly where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> was, where we worked in that <span class="REGION">area</span> --<span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , Germans, <span class="DLF">roads</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> ... We saw people, they say now they didn't see us. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">You know, I put out...in the winter, I put out a little crumbs for the birds. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">They didn't have to hand us food. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">If they would just put a little crumbs or a potato peel on the <span class="DLF">street</span> where we had to walk, we wouldn't have been so hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">They didn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">They didn't do it, Linda. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I remember on that march -- me, I'm sharing it with you, I never share it, I will tell you that, just once I think I talked about it -- I ° Nesse identifies this <span class="NPIP">place</span> elsewhere as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Praust</span> --another women's subcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> , located in the immediate area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Danzig</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">remember sleeping, they told us to rest a little bit, and in the snow there was manure of a horse or a cow all dried out and straw with it and undigested grain. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I remember taking that grain, washing it in the snow, taking out the kernel and eating it. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I tell you the truth, as I look back, I think I fulfilled a big commandment to save a human life. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And I say it again, I saved my life by doing... I think sometimes I shouldn't tell about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">It's a horrible thing to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">But I feel today I really want to tell you as much as I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">On that march, it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">They were beating us with the underside of a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">They didn't want to waste the bullets, they wanted to clobber us dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">See, I have this scar on my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">One night, we were put up in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Sometime they put is in a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="697">That night the women saw cows that had milk in the udder; and the women started to milk the cows and drink the milk in their mouths. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">I didn't do it, but I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I didn't even know. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I was sleeping, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">All of a sudden, we heard noise: the farmer yelling, "I let you let in these dirty women in my <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , and they are drinking the milk that I am supposed to sell tomorrow in the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> !" </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Instead of saying, "I'm so happy that they can have one night a little milk." </span><span class="sentence" id="703">The guard, the SS, ran into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and it was stampede in the middle of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">They made us go out of that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">They were hitting us with the underside of the guns and with clubs. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And I was hit on the head on this side; and I swear to you, fire came out from my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I had like a slight concussion-- I couldn't...no open wound, but I couldn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Two women quickly grabbed me and held me in their arms.

<p><span class="sentence" id="782">ANSWER:  I was liberated that night; and I remember I cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I cried at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And many times, as I sleep now or I am awakened by a nightmare, I think of that night of liberation and I wonder why did I cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">At one point, I felt guilty that I survived, Linda, as well as other survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Was I better than my friends and my cousins and my buddies and my uncles and my aunts and my father? </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Was I better? </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And then I was sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And maybe I cried for me, because I was all alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">At that time I did not know how many of [my] family survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">You see, Linda, I was very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">My mother survived the Holocaust in a camp just like mine; my brother (unclear word) survived the Holocaust in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau concentration camp</span> ; my brother Menashe was liberated by the Russians in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , in that <span class="BUILDING">smokehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">So I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">My two brothers are alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">My mother has died since, but nobody killed her. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">She died by illness. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">So that night, I cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">But I haven't cried since. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">You see, I choke up; you will see a tear in my eye, but it doesn't come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">I learn to laugh, I learn to live, but I forgot how to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">The next day when the medics came, they started to carry all the women that couldn't walk from that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="802">You see, the Germans of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> took their horses and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and ran away, they went with the Germans, they were retreating so there were not many horses left, maybe a few horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">That was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chrinow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="804">I always wonder how big it was but I know now that it wasn't big. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">I remember small <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , it was like a small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ; and I don't remember really where they made the <span class="BUILDING">makeshift hospital</span> , whether it was in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or whether in some other <span class="BUILDING">public building</span> because it wasn't a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="806">They quickly made some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , some wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> that they put the people up. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">The only thing that I remember was that I was carried in one of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and I was told that I have to wait maybe a day or two until this <span class="BUILDING">makeshift hospital</span> will be ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">I was put on a straw sack, not just straw but it was already a sack of straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">Next to me, when I opened my eyes, I saw a woman who I recognized as a teacher of one of the Yavneh, of the <span class="BUILDING">religious schools</span> --from the <span class="BUILDING">girl's school</span> , a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">She looked so horrible, she looked terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">I don't think I recognized -- I don't know how I recognized her. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And I was so glad that she was next to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">But an hour later she was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">You have to understand, many, many survivors died after liberation--the weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Many that were even maybe a little stronger and could walk into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , they started to eat and their stomach was shrunken, they died because they ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">Some died because they didn't eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Typhoid, dysentery. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">The next day or a day after they came this Russian people with some help of the villagers that they recruited to do this work and they carried me to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where my hair was shaven from all over my body and I was dunked in DDT to kill all the lice and whatever, insects, and then I was unconscious for three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">I don't remember naturally what happened but I remember when I opened my eyes I saw a big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a lot of women laying there and some Russian doctor who happened to be Jewish talking to me and telling me that I was unconscious for three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">I must have had typhoid, high fever, maybe delirious, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">My toes were black frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">They were considering to cut it off but this particular doctor said to wait, not to cut it. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">He thought if it doesn't start to rot, maybe it will peel off. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And it did, it peeled off. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">I weighed maybe 55 pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">The first time I saw myself was in a reflection in a <span class="DLF">door</span> in a little <span class="DLF">window</span> of a <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="828">When I looked at that <span class="DLF">door</span> -- I wanted to see what's <span class="NPIP">outside</span> when I could stand on my feet already and look <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , maybe it was a week or ten days after liberation -- I saw the most horrible creature, a skeleton with eyes <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and I turned around to look who is behind me and nobody was behind me. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And it took me time to realize that this was me. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">This happened right away after, you know... We got wonderful care from the Russian army, from the medics at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">The women that were just little bit stronger among our own women started to be like nurses, carried a little bit of food to give us, make sure -- many, many of us went on hunger strikes after liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">We said we don't want to live no more, many. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">You found many incidents, different incidents. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And to make sure the little food we got, we ate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">The fill that was given, we swallowed, the people among ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">Six weeks I was in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Then I was given by this committee or whoever was 1n charge a dress, a pair of underpants, pair of shoes, a pair of socks and I was told to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Where? </span><span class="sentence" id="839">There was another woman at that time who was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , which is <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">Now, I thought the best <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go is back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Maybe somebody is alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I didn't know [if] my mother survived or my brother survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">I had hoped that maybe my brother who escaped survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">So with this woman -- you didn't need a ticket, they gave you some kind of piece of paper that you are a survivor and you are traveling. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">So <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight trains</span> , you hopped on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fright train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="846">I hopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">You couldn't walk, you had feet that were just frozen off, shoes that were man's shoes, you could hardly move. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">I was trying to get to_6d_. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">Somebody already that we start to talk on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , we met other survivors from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and somebody said everybody says that in 6d_ there is a little bit of a community that helps you. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">So that's how I got to _6d_.In_6d_-- whenI came first to 6d_ there wasn't much organized there. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">But there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> where there was a big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ; and I remember like I don't know if there were billboards or just papers hanging. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And it said "Lithuania" and "Latvia" and "<span class="COUNTRY">Estonia</span> " and "<span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> " and "<span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And people signed in where they are from, what their name 1s, where they are going. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">As I was looking on that billboard to see, you know, I said, "Wait a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">Let me look. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">Maybe somebody [is] from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="857">A woman was standing there, and said to me, "You're Nesse Galperin from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="858">You are from the dairy business." </span><span class="sentence" id="859">You know, you are always identified by what you did. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">And this woman said to me, "Your mother is alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">I saw her alive after liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">I think she is in this and this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Now, I don't even remember which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">Anyway, back I go with -- I couldn't move -- back -- people say "Where are you going backwards, crazy little girl, where are you going backwards?" </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I got to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Maybe it took me a week to get to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , or two weeks--I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Begging for a little food -- you know, nobody still gave us food, you had to beg or call it or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">And still that one dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">You know, you were not in very good shape at that point: a big wound here, pus going and smelling terrible, my head wrapped because my head was shaven off with a shmata, with a rag, to cover it. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I got to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ;

She was lovely, she was darling; I loved her dearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">I used to [say,] "Tante, you have pictures of my family." </span><span class="sentence" id="916">She said "When I will die, you will have them." </span><span class="sentence" id="917">A few of them she gave us to make a copy. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">You can see this is a copy of a picture that she gave us a long time ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">My father, my mother, my two brothers, me as a tiny little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">But after she passed -- when she passed away a few years ago, her children were kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">They said to me, "Go to the album and take whatever of your family." </span><span class="sentence" id="922">So I do have -- I'm luckier than some other survivors. (</span><span class="sentence" id="923">2) This is a picture of my two brothers and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">You know it helps to show especially children of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to see that we were normal-looking, nice... Look just like they do. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">We were not different. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">We were not abused because we looked different. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">We were abused because we were Jews and went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="928">3) This is a picture of me just a year before, here I was 12. (</span><span class="sentence" id="929">4) This picture -- I'm going to show you two pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">Not just the front of the picture means a lot to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">This my family in on the Pesach of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">This my grandmother, my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">My grandmother was 16 when my father was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">When I show this picture, people think it was his sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">She was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="936">My father was one of 16 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">Nine were alive before the war, and one is alive [after]. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">Imagine how many cousins and how many relatives! </span><span class="sentence" id="939">I didn't even know their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And my uncles. (</span><span class="sentence" id="941">5) And this is the couple... A couple is here--a man and a woman--my mother's cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">This 1s taken from _6d_, just before the Nazis came to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">They had some money, they bought their way out. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And when they came, they told us they did not know that people were being killed but they knew that people were being taken from 6d_ and taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="945">6) And to follow up this, after my aunt died and I looked through her things that the children were getting ready to throw away, I found an envelope that I'm going to present to the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="946">When I saw the Swastikas on this envelope, I knew that this is a piece of documentation. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">The letter inside was not there, whether my cousin did not realize it and threw it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">This letter was sent to my aunt to whom I sent all these pictures, Mr. Jaffe, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And I feel terrible that I don't know what was in the letter, what they were asking for--whether they were saying the truth of what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And I assume that they were taken 1940 from 6d_ to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="951">Maybe this is already from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="952">The letter came from...it's my mother's uncle and aunt by the name of Hablinski. (</span><span class="sentence" id="953">7) Now I have one more picture that I would like to share with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Well, this also...this also a picture I want to share with you, my father on Chanukah going from the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> with my two brothers. (</span><span class="sentence" id="955">8) But the most what I want to share with you, which is precious to me, the last thing I have from my father, his handwriting is the signed "Pinchas (unclear word)." </span><span class="sentence" id="956">So this is very valuable to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">But I always like to share it with people. (</span><span class="sentence" id="958">9) Now this particular picture was given to me by a friend of mine, that he received from <span class="BUILDING">Yad Vashem</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="959">This is a document, a copy of a document that we don't know whether the Lithuanians took or the Germans took. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">This is a picture of our Rabbis and the scholars before they were taken out to be shot--the thousand men that I was telling you about. (</span><span class="sentence" id="961">10) Now, I have one more thing that I want to show. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">I don't know who has it in print, who does not have it, where it could be obtained. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">But this book is called Pinkas Shavli. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Here is a map of the two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> that I was talking about, where they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">In this book, a teacher of my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- his name is Yerushalmi -- wrote a diary in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> every day of what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">He was assigned to do so by the Jewish Community Council, and it was written originally in Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">When I saw this book at a friend of mine['s] <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I was very anxious to get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">And with a lot of persuading, let's put it that way, I got this book. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And I just wanted to make sure that my memories are right. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And as I read this book, I see that this 1s exactly what I shared with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">All is written in this book; and it's called -- let me just put it here in the front and you will see what it is: Pinkas Shavli. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">It's a diary that was written, just as many diaries, by this gentleman who 1s not alive anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">He has died. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">He dedicated it to his son who perished during that time. (</span><span class="sentence" id="975">11) Look at this picture and see the Rabbis that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">This is the cousin that came to us and told us the people were taken from 6d_ to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="977">This is me on the end, this is my older brother, my younger brother, one of my uncles, my grandmother who looked like a sister to my father at that point, and my mom. (</span><span class="sentence" id="978">12) This is me at the age of 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And I always show it to children, and tell them that I looked just like any child in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="980">13) I will turn this one around too. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">This picture, I was talking about my father's signature. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">It has the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> on it and the date. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">This picture was sent in 1930s. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">I was 2 years old here. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">My two brothers, they are older than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">This my family on vacation, a copy of a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">As you can see, somebody didn't give me the picture, it was just a copy. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">My family, my parents, myself as a baby, my brothers. </span>
