<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  I-I made some notes, listening through to your first interview, about just some concepts I wanted to go over and some things, but the first thing I need for the tape, which is so simple, is your name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Renata Laqueur.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Did you ever have a middle name or anything?</span></p>

Weiss, who was at that point a citizen and I became a citizen because I married an American and I thought I better be an American, I regret it until today. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I should have kept my Dutch passport.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  S -- was up and down with <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Right now I'm -- there are days when I'm very happy and very proud of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and there are days when I just wish Renata Laqueur 3 February 7, 1998 I were Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">That has nothing to do with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Anyway, 1957 I had a hearing for the citizenship and the guy said to me, “This is your chance to change your name. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Why don't you become Linda or Marilyn?” </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Linda was because, it was of Linda Darnell! </span><span class="sentence" id="21">or -- and many of the movie stars at that time, Marilyn was because of Marilyn Monroe. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And I said, “I want one change. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I want to change the “e” to an “a” from Renate, because I don't like the German ending and I want to chuck out my middle names.” </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And that's how I became Renata Laqueur.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Now you were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brieg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which is today <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , because the border- after the Russians moved west, it is now near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , which is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wroclaw</span> today. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And my grandparents were from there, it was the third or the fourth generation and I was very -- my mother all told me proudly, “You were born in your great-grandmother's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And I was three years old when my father moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">That's a story in itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And so I was born in November 197 and I was before Christmas in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and we made? </span><span class="sentence" id="31">in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> till -- I would say till <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , so that is 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So my whole basic education, including <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> and -- no, and a year of study in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , was all in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So my mother -- my mother tongue is -- my parents spoke German and I answered in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , in Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So again, like in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , where the kids are in there in English* and the f -- and their parents speak either Italian or Russian or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">1 R.L.: Renata meant to say “Linda was because, it was the name of Linda Darnell...” 2 R.L.: November 1919. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">3R.L.: Renata meant to say “lived.” </span><span class="sentence" id="37">4R.L.: Renata meant to say “So again, like in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , where the kids are there and speak English...” Renata Laqueur 4 February 7, 1998
QUESTION:  So what -- you're an American citizen, born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , now <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , grew up in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">What is your n -- your identity now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  My identity? </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Only American. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Because I've lived -- I would say -- I'm 78, so if I'm here since 1953, I've spent the greater part of my life in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and I've lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And I couldn't immigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> because I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I was on the German quota, so I went on my Dutch passport, as an immigrant to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And within nine months, the time it takes to get a baby, I had a visa to come in as an immigrant, because I hired a lawyer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And the moment I hit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> , I got an immigration lawyer, who got me nine months later, on an immigration visa to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , because I had met my second husband and I was chasing him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  So you were by yourself in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  I was by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I immigrated alone and I wo-worked for a year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  This goes -- gives you some idea of the Dutch education. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">In a <span class="BUILDING">Dutch school</span> , you grow up with four languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So I had Dutch, French as a second language, German as the third, English as the fourth and a base of Latin and Greek. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> -- I had gone to a <span class="BUILDING">secretarial school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , because when I wanted to study, which was 1938, when I got my bachot>, my what is it, the eindexamen?</span><span class="sentence" id="53">® for the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">My father said, “You don't study till you have a skill.” </span><span class="sentence" id="55">He was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">He said, “I'll send you to <span class="BUILDING">secretarial school</span> for a year, you come out with French, German, English, Dutch, shorthand, bookkeeping, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">An <span class="BUILDING">international secretarial school</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="58">6 Findexamen: final exam (Dutch) Renata Laqueur 5 February 7, 1998 I tell you, I made my life with that <span class="BUILDING">secretarial school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">In <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , later on I used this education when I studied, because I could do notes. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I was in comparative literature in four languages, without any problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So I'm very grateful, because I didn't study in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , but I made up for it by studying later on, 40 years later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  I want to go back to your saying that y-your identity is as an American, because as you pointed out, you have a <span class="INT_SPACE">Dutch kitchen</span> , you have this poster --

<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  L-Let's get back to the identity thing for a little bit.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="732">QUESTION:  Do you think of yourself as a very sentimental person?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">ANSWER:  Not... no, it's strange that you say sentimental. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">I think I'm more faithful than sentimental. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I believe in continuation, in continuity. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And it's funny that you asked that question, I have never thought about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">What I'm saying is what I'm really thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Continuity in a life which has been a constant fight against chaos. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And remains a life against cha*° -- fight against chaos. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">We talked about God and praying, what I mainly pray for or am thankful for is continuity. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">If you come out of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , if you come out of metastatic colon cancer, third degree, at an <span class="BUILDING">institute</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sloan-Kettering</span> and you have a year of chemo and you can only take five months of this crap because the side effects are too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And if you then come back and struggle and are almost better than before, that's continuity. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And sentimental, yes I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Because when John Glenn decided or Clinton decided that John Glenn, whatever -- whatever plays up, will be in <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> this year, I got sentimental. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">I felt, hey, this is great, I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And I saw that and I was really grown up when he was doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">It was 1960 -- whatever it was, '69 was the moon, so this must have Renata Laqueur 32 February 7, 1998 been '62 or three. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">So I was just studying and now Glenn, who was my same age, one year younger, 1s going into <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , then I tell myself, he's doing the impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">That's continuity.</span></p>

ANSWER:  That's sentimental. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">That 1s pure sentimental because it has nothing to do with anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">It's just a sentiment that I admired the guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I didn't particularly like him as a politician, but I liked him as an astronaut.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="754">QUESTION:  The way you describe continuity sounds more like what someone else would call survival.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">ANSWER:  Yeah but, 1s survival really -- you see, the trouble with survival is I'm not only talking about physical, because when I mentioned the physical, it's not too -- of course the cancer and I mentioned <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , it's the physical, but I'm also talking about mental survival, spiritual survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">The mere fact of those, that's why I'm so bitter about the publication. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">The fact that there were people who had the spiritual resistance, defiance, to write under these circumstances, that to me is continuity, that to me is c-- survival, but that should be published. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And so what, so if Anne®’ diary -- writes diary while she is hiding, the danger is there, but it's not the danger of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> .</span></p>
