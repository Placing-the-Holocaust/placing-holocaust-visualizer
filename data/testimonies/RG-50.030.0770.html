<p>ANSWER:  On the very beginning, we didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1747">I knew quite a lot because of my father pretty high position in — in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1748">So, for instance, when Russians were coming and are close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> , people were saying we’re Armia Kryova. </span><span class="sentence" id="1749">At first they were treated nicely, but then they were <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> there, something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1750">So, before the insurrection, we knew already what was really expecting us, that unless we’ll be strong enough to get <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> before the Russians would come in, but they stop, and they didn’t want the allies to — to come in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , whatever, once more they —</p>

<p>QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1759">ANSWER:  — because nobody expected that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1760">They expected that people will be separated, but not that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1761">Later they knew and most likely we know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1762">But for quite a time Jewish people didn’t know that when there 1s a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> is to be killed.</span></p>
