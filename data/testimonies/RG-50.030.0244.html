<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I want to cut that. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I was 20...20 years old, because I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ralley</span> , <span class="REGION">Kansas</span> , the Second Calvary, which was a horse drawn outfit at that time, and we stayed there until, uh, uh, they broke the horses up and they made it all mechanized. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And when I say mechanized, everybody went in different directions. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And, uh, then I wound up on the <span class="REGION">West Coast</span> ...uh, with the 107th Calvary, and they eventually broke that up and moved us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Hood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">It's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Port Hood</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">The mechanized outfit. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And from there, why, we became replacements. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I hope I am not getting too fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We became replacements while the war was on. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">This was after D-Day. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I should summarize this a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">For the 3rd Calvary, which we...uh...we were replacements for the 3rd Calvary for the line duty men we called it see, when the boys passed and got hurt and killed, why we replaced that. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And I...1f 1 am going too fast or...

<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">That's fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  Then we went...and I was assigned to Troop F, which is the only...the rest of the squadron was accompanied, but this troop was Troop F. They called it Troop F in the cavalry. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I'd like to emphasize the 3rd Calvary was Patton's old 3rd Calvary...a harsh Navy exec officer, General Patton, and he was quite...he was quite...he was quite interested in us at all times because this is his old outfit. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">We reconned for the 4th and 6th Army Divisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We went through the southern route of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  Reconnaissance squadrons are squadrons that would go and find the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Like the Panzer Division of some sort....an illustration of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Panzer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">We could not fight it because we were light <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and we would have to back off and back away and let the 4th and the heavy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> at the <span class="DLF">port</span> in the 6th Harbor come in and fight for us see. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And we would...Reconnaissance Squadrons...that's what they called us....a reconnaissance squadron to find out where everybody was and how we would fight them, and then the Colonel...we were attached to the 20th Corps...uh...I wanted to get that in. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And...uh...which we fought all the way in the south, fighting...fought our way through the south, literally fought our way through the south at all times, all day...many battles I was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I mean, not only me, but the, this troop.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  I might ask what was the year that you went over to Europe?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  What part of Europe did you go to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  Oh, we went by <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , all the <span class="REGION">southern Germany</span> , Cassell Uh, we just went all out. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Well, once you...once you became a replacement, you went to <span class="DLF">replacement pool</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And once you became a replacement, you were forwarded to that...to that outfit, and you were another man. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">You would take his <span class="NPIP">place</span> as a replacement in the troop. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And we fought all through <span class="REGION">southern Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Who was your officer in charge?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Captain Brennan.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  And how many men consisted of your little reconnaissance group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  Oh, there was...was quite a...quite a...1t wasn't a small one. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">You mean of this one company? </span><span class="sentence" id="74">250 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">That's only one.... Now a reconnaissance squadron is a group of companies, but our troop was one troop. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We were the tank troop. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">They had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored cars</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored vehicles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">They had half tracks, uh, light tanks, and we were the light <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> for this here one...this here one group. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We were only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> in this here one squadron, in 3rd Cavalry reconnaissance squadron. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We were the only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , but we had...there were two or three other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">squadrons</span> attached to 20th Corps that went a different route. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">We had this here...we wound up in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and our commanding officer was Colonel Walleck.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  So the Germans were beginning to be pushed back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">They were fading back, and they...we had...we knew how to fight the Panzer see. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Eventually you could not fight a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Panzer tank</span> because the bullets, shells and everything would hit the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Uh...you...you...the just...you know, they would glance off, but then they would put concrete in front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> so we would have to hit them on the side to knock them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">You would have to go around to the side and shoot them and knock the tracks, the half tracks off of them, and that's how you destroyed them, and then they started fading, and people started...the Vermax started to give up...you know what I mean...and everybody...the horse drawn, there was a lot of horses, and they were...dead people...I hate to get into this...were all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I mean, you know, soldiers, horses and dead horses and just everything until... And we knew that we were...we knew that we were forwarding...we knew we had a hope then you know what I mean...and we could fight and fight much better and we didn't...we didn't come to that much resistance like we had for awhile there. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">We had an awful lot of resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And a German was a very good fighter. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And the Panzer Division is an excellent fighter. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">You had to know what you were doing, because he could maneuver the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> , and there is an art of maneuvering <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And anyhow we went in, and we passed, and we went through <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and we went into the...I hope I am not getting too fast.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">This is fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">What part of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> did you enter?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Southern end. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And...uh, this is where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> and uh...Kamer...and we did not get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wien</span> ... <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> ...they call it <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wien</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">We did not get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We stopped there at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Matter of fact, we were supposed to get a relief for awhile off the <span class="DLF">line</span> , and that was the time that we did get our relief and, uh, when we ran into this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> ... It was late at night, about 2:00 in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We were driving. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">We never, generally never drove at night, and I never seen a battle at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I never seen a battle at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  Is that right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  I never seen a battle at night and I better explain that why. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Because to drive the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> you got to have some kind of uh, some light or something...I mean you can't just go down without something on and if you showed...there's a little strips of light, and if you would show a strip of light, you would be shot at. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So that always bewildered me about people said they fought. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Now I was out on patrol at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I stayed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And we stayed in <span class="BUILDING">farmhouses</span> and everything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  By the way, talking about the <span class="BUILDING">farmhouses</span> and the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> that you came to, what was the reaction of the people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  They were...the <span class="BUILDING">farm houses</span> over there...1t was...some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> ...there was 2 or 3 times that our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> that we had we'd be going down the <span class="DLF">hill</span> and we make a turn, and we slide into the <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> , and just knock a <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">You see the <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> ...the people lived on top of the <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> , and the, uh, uh, cows and everything was in the bottom of the <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And they were good people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">They were good people and they...the Vermark, I don't believe wanted war. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I don't believe they wanted war. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I mean 2 or 3 of them surrendered to me, just walked up and surrendered to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And, uh, uh, I don't believe...now of course the SS they were very staunch and they wanted to do everything what they wanted to do, and they are very cold hearted people I guess you might put it in that they cared about nothing, but only the <span class="REGION">father land</span> and they believed that that...uh...we would have our hardest battles with the Panzer Division which was right close to the SS and uh, uh, they were hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">They were good fighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I mean they are not...you could never take that away from them, they were very good fighters, and they fight to the bitter end, ‘til they died, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And, uh, I lost a lot of friends in battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I seen battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I was in battle, and one of my dear friends who was One...was a tank driver...his name was Buckles...Captain Brennan told him a thousand times that when you go into battle, you buckle up. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Down with the Buckles couldn't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">He had to have his head up, and they blew his head off. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And I have had a lot of friends of mine that died in... We would stay...I hope this gets to some of the old timers. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">If we would get into a <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> and it was vacant, and we got to sleep at night we would try to get in where...close up to where they shoot...if they were going to shoot that morning, they would shoot through the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , and we would be under there avoiding them, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Avoiding the bullets, avoiding the bullets because they would shoot in, and they would go to the <span class="DLF">door</span> on the other end, but we were close over by the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Let me specify that. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And it's a great feeling to get up in the morning, and you don't know if you are going to die or not, that you lived and that you...that you...it's just a great feeling when it was all over with that you can say you lived and we moved out many times early morning to go fight, but not fight at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Not until that daybreak because you had to see what's going on, and you would...you could...uh...the...we would fight and then if it's too heavy, the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> would come in and they would make a diamond. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And I seen a lot of American boys...I knew I was in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> ...and I knew there were American infantry men all around me, and they were...the only protection they had was that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> , and they were <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and I was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">However, if the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> was hit, one of our Lieutenants, Lieutenant Benslak, his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> was hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">He burned up in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Everybody burns if it is hit properly enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And see, these memories I have for 40 years. (</span><span class="sentence" id="138">sobbing)
QUESTION:  No problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">There's some Kleenex. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">You are bringing back some memories and we understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">As time went on, as you are getting closer and closer to the <span class="REGION">Heartland</span> so to speak, did you begin to hear some of the stories about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  Yes, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But we didn't...we didn't... we knew there were...we were starting to get the stories from other people, but we never witnessed this until we got into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself and...
QUESTION:  What were some of the stories?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  Well, we sort of figured that the Jews were kept in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , you know, like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , uh, uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and, uh, but these were all hearsay third party, fourth party things, and, uh, uh, we would hear that just like if our...our...uh...when we get mail, and they would. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">We would get...our mail would come up to us, you know what I mean, and "Did you hear about this? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">You know there's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , you know, maybe up this way or 200 miles or 500 miles or something like that see." </span><span class="sentence" id="147">But 1t never phased me. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I never... never bothered about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I never...I didn't...1 was too concerned looking out for my own life, and everybody else was. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">When you are in war, you don't have to tell a man to clean his gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">He will take care of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">He don't want to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And these are the things of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And so but anyhow, we.. getting back to my story, we proceeded into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> in the lower end where all the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lakes</span> were and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> were and we were mostly on a...we were sort of like on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol unit</span> , you know what I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Cause you can't fight too well in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> , in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">It's hard to go by, and these are facts. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I don't know what any other body said, but I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So we went into this <span class="REGION">area</span> , and we got there about 2 o'clock in the morning, and we started hearing moans, but the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> always moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">You know what I mean, a little bit every bit, but we got into this <span class="REGION">area</span> about 2 o'clock.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  What is the <span class="REGION">area</span> you are speaking of?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="204">QUESTION:  What did they look like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  Human...Let me see. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I wanted to explain that. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I am glad you asked that question. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Their eyes were sunk in. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Did you ever seen anybody with a cancer that was wasted to nothing? </span><span class="sentence" id="210">They were wasted to nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Absolutely nothing! </span><span class="sentence" id="212">They would bring these men into these <span class="DLF">salt mines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">This was a <span class="DLF">salt mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And they were... would assume they were big men, and they would whittle them down to nothing, and they're.. They would not feed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">They would give them potato peelings, and, uh, that's what the inmates told us, and that, uh, they would have so much cubic, piece of bread, and the guards, who were ex-convicts of German...they were German ex-convicts ran these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps...</span> I mean would...ran the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">They would come and ask how many people was there that the inmates would tell it, and we want half of that in the morning when roll call would come. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And they...I went and I seen...from there, we proceeded...we tried to feed them, and we had to feed them under a guard, under an armed guard, a <span class="DLF">soup line</span> , so they wouldn't get out and they wouldn't feed up their stomach. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">They didn't have...they were just bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">There was nothing to these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And their stomach...they could only digest the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">They couldn't...they didn't have nothing to digest. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">They didn't have no body, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Anyhow, we got that...and if you would throw a cigarette down, 4 or 5 inmates would jump on that cigarette, a butt of a cigarette, to smoke that cigarette, see. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And then we went into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and they were high and there were 2 men to each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And then we proceeded and then they told us to go to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">4 high and 2 to each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">The inmates asked us to come to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">We didn't know what we were going into. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">We were...they asked us, "Please come." </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I remember going into there...going to there, and then I seen one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I would say there was 500 bodies stacked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">At least 500. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I am not exaggerating. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">I took pictures of them in my album and if anybody sees this in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> , I would like to refer to my album that I gave to the St. Louis Jewish Council on Ala Street in 1946 of January, when I was discharged out of the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">But getting back to that, their tattoos was not on their arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">There were some on their arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Displaced person! </span><span class="sentence" id="239">But these people in this...in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ...these bodies, I should say, the tattoos were on their chest. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And then we proceeded from that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to go to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , and they would put 2 people on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">slab</span> in this <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">They would have...they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">operating tables</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">They would take the gold out of their teeth...gold out of their teeth, and make rings out of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And on the sign of the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , it says, "My body would rather be burned than go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , and they would push them into the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> to burn them, which they would be gone in 15 minutes or whatever it took them. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Very quick! </span><span class="sentence" id="245">But on this thing, I know, I was trying to find a word for it last night and I found this word. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Hitler wanted to exterminate the Jews and this is terrible, and God would not let that happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">I heard other stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Not in this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> down the years, that they would have the Jewish people go into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and tell them that they were taking a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> ...you probably heard this story...where they would gas them. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And that's the God's honest truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I know they did that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">QUESTION:  How long were you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  Almost a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">A little less. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">In other words, I was attached to Major Kone, who was Judge Advocate Department when he came in for the pictures and everything and I was attached to his...I was relieved....I was taking pictures...which my pictures went to the <span class="BUILDING">Allied Supreme Headquarters</span> , and went to the Nuremberg trial over that, and, uh, what I wanted to do... wanted to leave a little legacy of this to remind the youngest Jewish children that it did happen because I witnessed it, and I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And their heritage is at stake and they should never forget, never forget, because 44 years ago as of this day I can look at it vividly that those persons...dead persons in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ...stacked... You don't forget those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">You cannot.</span></p>

There were no sides to it, and they put a lot of the buried bodies...put them on there to take them to there. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And there was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> that came... However, they knew that there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">They knew there was some kind of an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">inmate camp</span> there because they knew tt. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">They couldn't avoid it. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">You know what I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And however, they did come down to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And there was a nun there that came to help and that period everything kind of got moved around a little bit there. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">You know what I mean.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">QUESTION:  Did they volunteer to come in or did the commander?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">ANSWER:  We went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And of course, they volunteered. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">That was technical...I am glad you asked that question. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">But we told them to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and told them to come down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">But they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">They didn't object to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">It was sort of a volunteer I guess you would say, but at our request. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And then the, the inmates caught one of the officers who was at that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> about a week later I guess, and they turned him over to the military authority and one guard they caught and they spread eagled him and stoned him to death, on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , so he must have been a...must have been a very bad man of some sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And the nuns came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Then they told us that there was another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Am I getting to far?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Maybe before we get to the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ... The towns people...did they deny what was going on there? </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Although they knew it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">ANSWER:  That was a good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">I am glad you asked that. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">They knew it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">They did...let's put it they didn't want to be bothered. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">uh, They knew that that was a concentration...they knew that the Jews were in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="292">You couldn't help from knowing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">You take a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that large and working in the <span class="DLF">salt mines</span> and seeing some of them people, they would have to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">They would have to go to them <span class="DLF">salt mines</span> under guard or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">You couldn't help from knowing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">But it seems they just didn't...they took it for granted that that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And I tell you another little thing that I would as of this day, I... don't know for sure...I honestly can't say this for sure, but I could have swore to this day that I seen one of the biggest officials near that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">He was a young officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And I don't want to get into that, because I don't know for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">But faces don't change. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">You might get old, but faces don't change 1n years, and they...they said he knew a lot of things were going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and to this day, I believe he did know it because I am sure he was...he was it was just there. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I just know it, but I don't want to get into...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> brought into see the burial?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">ANSWER:  The towns people were brought in to made help bury the people, to dig, help dig the <span class="DLF">graves</span> , uh, and bury them where they're were mass, which they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">But the most important thing, that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was a very. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">It's very grateful that that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was there, because they could help do the things that were supposed to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">QUESTION:  What was the reaction of the towns-people when they saw upfront the people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  Amazed. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And...uh...
