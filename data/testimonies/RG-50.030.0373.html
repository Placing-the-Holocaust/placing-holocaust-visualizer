<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Can we begin by your stating your name, your date of birth and where you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My name is Michel Reynders, R-E-Y-N-D-E-R-S. Date of birth, June 29, 1931. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">Born in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Called Uccle, U-C-C-L-E.
QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  My family on my father's side is a large family. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My grandfather was a physician in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">boroughs</span> , if you want, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">They had eight children, my grandparents had eight children. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">My grandmother was, as we say, the strong woman of the Gospel. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">She was leading and reigning over that family like a headmistress. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">But, she was a very, very wonderful lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My parents, my father was a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My mother was a housewife. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">They met when my father was a young doctor and their first encounter was actually when my mother was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">operating table</span> when she had appendicitis. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Then they got married in 1930 and I was born in 1931. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Ihave a brother, a sister who was born in 1935 and a brother who was born in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And we had, we lived in a very nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> which to me remains the epitome of a nice <span class="BUILDING">family house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">My grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was also a very nice one. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And we very frequently met our cousins and uncles and all of that, the whole family, in her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in that big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Actually, we had a sort of a little reunion of the cousins who were around practically every week. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Every Tuesday. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And we gathered around the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with sweets, cookies and breads and you would call them danish, but we didn't call them that. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Then in 1938, my parents bought another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which I didn't like and I never did like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Even though we lived in it for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And, well, shall I tell you about our, the things we did for entertainment?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Yes, but just one moment, please. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Are you hearing the clock? </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Well, what I'm trying to get a sense of, of course, is your lifestyle, what was disrupted because, clearly, in 1940, things changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Oh, absolutely, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  And also a sense of your religious affiliation, all of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Well, my, on my mother's side, let's say they were, theoretical Catholics. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">On my father's side, they were very devout Catholics. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Everybody went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> on Sunday, every Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And to confession a few times a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Just to get the load off their chest, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">On my mother's side, they were the type of Catholics who went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> for a baptism, wedding and funeral. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">My, on my father's side, my grandmother was a practical religious person. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">She didn't go for, you know, a lot of babbling and all that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But, she thought religion should be applied to your day-to-day life in a practical way. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">In other words, you know, it, she didn't believe much in kneeling on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> and then going like this and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">She said, do this thing right because that's the way God wants you to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And do that thing night and, you know, you'll be rewarded in your other life. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And, you know, she wanted to make religion a real part of their, of her life and our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And she actually didn't spend all that much time, well, just one, she, you know, didn't spend all that much time in <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and that's the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Just because, as I say, she was much more of a pragmatic person. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Very interesting lady, as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">What else can I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Well, we celebrated, of course, all the religious holidays in a very extensive way. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Mostly, Christmas and Easter. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But, you may know or not know, that in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , in addition to Christmas, the children celebrate St. Nicholas and that was the big event for the children before World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">We would all gather to, first in our own <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and then later to <span class="BUILDING">grandmother's home</span> , and get all the toys and candies. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">That would make us sick for two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">But they were delightful anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And we would sometimes go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">seaside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">In fact, quite frequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And the whole family would also meet there. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">We wouldn't always stay in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but since, you know, the <span class="DLF">Belgian sea coast</span> is very small, it was always easy to go from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And we would have big picnics and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">We were a very closely knit family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  Now, there were other people, other relatives of yours, who were very involved with the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> , yes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">My uncle, Father Bruno(ph), was a Benedictine Monk and he had three sisters, my three aunts, who were nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Two of them were Benedictine Nuns in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liesch(ph</span> ), <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">The third one was a Sister of Notre Dame, which is a teaching order. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And she was, she moved to various convents during her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">She is currently alive and well in Namure(ph), <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">She is 88 years old, almost 89. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And clear as a bell, sharp as a tack. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And she participated in Father Bruno's work quite a bit, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">As did the other sisters, who are now deceased.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  Did you go to <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> or to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  No, it was traditional... Pause in tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  I was asking you if went to public or <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  We went to <span class="BUILDING">religious schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">We, in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">diocese</span> or, you know, the lay, not the lay, but the nun, <span class="BUILDING">monastic schools</span> , are called <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">It has nothing to do with American college. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">You're in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> from your first grade on. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Until your 12th grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So, yes, I did go to, first to a small <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where the nuns were running the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I was very privileged in having a very, very demanding, if you want, but very charming nun as a kindergarten teacher, and I've never forgot her. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I still remember her as being a real guidance. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And then I went to the <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , St. Bonefas(ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Where my father had been, where my uncles had been. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And it was almost a family tradition already. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Still in existence now. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And, in fact, my brother was there, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And my, one of my cousins, oh, several of my cousins, actually, went through the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">It was a very, very wonderful <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I had the best teachers you can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And, you know, everybody keeps telling me, didn't you hate <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="89">No, I loved <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I just adored my teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">In the seventh grade I had a very tall, very powerful looking priest as a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And I can still hear him talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">He was extraordinary. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">He made us live Julius Caesar's wars. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Like you'd see a movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And a couple of three years later I had another teacher who was a strong, sturdy peasant from the Belgian Alden(ph), the south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgtum</span> where the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> are and those people have their feet on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Solidly on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , and he did, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And, again, I have such extraordinary memories from my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , you know, that I still relive them constantly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  Because you came from a family that at least was partly quite religious and you went to <span class="BUILDING">religious schools</span> , were there certain values that were instilled in you from an early age?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  Oh, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">As I told you, my grandmother was running the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> even from a distance, she was still running her children. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Her <span class="BUILDING">children's houses</span> with her strong principles that, you know, of charity, of tolerance. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Even though she was strict, she was tolerant. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">You know, it sounds like a contradiction, but it really wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">She was strict in her tolerance, you see what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="107">You, she thought you had to force yourself to be tolerant, even if you couldn't feel 1t immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">You just had to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And that was one of the principles that she inoculated into us from our very, very small childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And I think my, all my uncles and aunts, and my father as well, have always lived by those principles. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So, yes, mostly Christian values. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And, you know, people keep asking me, but what did you think about the other non- Christian people? </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Like the Jews and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">We didn't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">In <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , you didn't make that distinction. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I didn't know that we had Jewish neighbors where I lived until the SS came and took them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We were friends with them, we played in the <span class="DLF">park</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We, you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> was not at all a discriminatory country or discriminating country. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I'm bringing that up because I read not too long ago that when you immigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you have to say, Iam Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">There is no such thing in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">The identity cards that were issued never, never mentioned race, religion or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">It mentioned profession, job, that they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">But it never mentioned anything that had the slightest hint of discriminatory inkling, if I may say. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So, yes, we were, as I said, as you said and I said, high values were always proposed, if you want, by my parents and my grandparents and that included that, you know, that we accepted everybody as they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Not because they had red hair or black eyes or dark skin or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">But, because they were just people. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I think that is of extreme importance for what is going to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  Were you aware of anti-Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  No, I was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I'm sure there was a little, but not anywhere nearly as much as in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="131"><span class="COUNTRY">France</span> has always, for some reason, cultivated a certain ultra-right philosophy, if you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Which was definitely anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">We didn't have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Actually, it's to the point that we were never able to tell exactly how many Jews lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Because we had no way of knowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We had no records.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  Were you, as a kid, involved with any social or political organizations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  Not a political organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I did, I was, first of all, I was a cub scout for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">In <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> we had, we did have, just after saying there was no discrimination, I have to say that there were the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> cub scouts and the Christian cub scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">They were friendly, but they were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I was part of the Christian cub scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Then, let's see now, I, yes, I think I was part of a small social group where we went to see puppet shows and that sort of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">But, it didn't amount to very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Essentially, cub scouts and later on scouts, was my group activity, let's say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  And, your family, while they believed very strongly in charity, was that ever on any organized basis before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  My grandmother had a route, if you want to say, or route where she went and distributed food on a certain day every month. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Part of the St. Vincent DePaul general organization, which exists in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and exists in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And it consists of lay people who just get together and sort of, quote, unquote, adopt a few families. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">They visit them, and I think this is still being done, I'm not sure, but I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">They bring them food or clothes and try to help them if they have difficulty with the welfare system and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">That was, in a way, organized, if you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Oh, yes, my mother, actually, was part of the nationwide organization for the blind. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And, yes, she did, she was, in fact, one of the board members of that for quite some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And the same thing occurred there, they would have poor blind people assigned to them, if you want, to be visited and comforted and supplies brought as necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  One other question. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">What kind of a child were you? </span><span class="sentence" id="159">If you had to sort of describe your energy, your...
ANSWER:  I was, mine was to be very ornery, I'm sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">But, forgive me if I sound like I'm bragging, but I do remember that people were telling my parents, oh, he's well mannered, that child. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So, I guess my mother was very, very proper and she came from a rather proper family and she wanted us to have good manners and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I think she taught me good social behavior and, but other than that, I think I was very ornery. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I was running up and down and doing things and when my little sister was born, and we did very lots of very strange things. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Like making mud pies and throwing them at each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And one day my aunt visited us and my mother just showed her out to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and while they were gone, we decided to sample the port wine which my aunt and my mother had sampled before and I never understood why the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was spinning so much around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And my little sister fell asleep and we woke up the next day, I think it must have been with a headache, but I don't remember that for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">In <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , as I say, I enjoyed <span class="BUILDING">school</span> enormously. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And, so it wasn't a chore, it wasn't a burden for me to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So, I studied with great pleasure and I guess I managed to have pretty decent grades. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">That way. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">It wasn't any, you know, great effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I didn't really force myself, I just studied because I thought it was fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And particularly the literary branches, such as Latin, Greek. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And during the war later on, German and English languages, to me were something where I literally basked in learning those.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  What do you remember about your Uncle Bruno before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Well, we saw him very frequently because unlike most Benedictine Monks, he was not always cloistered. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">In fact, he dubbed himself the most mobile Benedictine in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Even before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">He taught catechism at the <span class="DLF">Belgian border</span> to Nazi, no, I mean, non-Nazi children who would cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> before World War II to learn catechism because it was forbidden in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and under Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">He went to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> during the sad events of 1938 and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And he was frequently a visitor, a quick visitor, it was just come in and out for, you know, an hour or two and I still have someplace, some pictures of me on his knee where he made me jump on his knee. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And I liked him very, very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">He was the image of perfection to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">He was almost a semi-god. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I had an excellent relationship with him and I kept that relation throughout until his death. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Unfortunately, when I was here I didn't see him as much as I wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">But, I had an excellent relationship with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">He was a very warm, outgoing person, very funny, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">He told the funniest stories and had a great sense of humor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">QUESTION:  What did you know about Hitler and Nazism before <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> was occupied? </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Did you know much...
ANSWER:  Hardly anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  ...German refugees coming in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  We saw a few. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And, as a matter of fact, this is not Hitler it's Mussolini, in 1938, my parents took in a young Italian girl, about 14 or 15, to be our babysitter. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Because her parents, her father was an active Socialist and had to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> under the Fascist regime, and fled to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And, just as an aside, I absolutely adored that lady and I lost track of her completely until 1986. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I decided, I've got to find her again. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So, I wrote a letter to the mayor of her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> asking, 1s this lady still alive? </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Does she live 1n that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I didn't get an answer for about six months, but one day I got a letter from her. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So, obviously, the mayor had passed on the letter to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">She wrote me and said, I remember you as if 1t was yesterday. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I went to see her in Asti(ph) in the north of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">She came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And we're still writing to each other every month and the most adorable lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">So, that's one thing I did know. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">About Fascism. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">As you Say, we did see a few, yes, a few refugees, but, you know, until 19, well, in 1940, I was just nine years old and at that time, I don't think I understood the full impact. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">But, you grow very rapidly in a war, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">It didn't take us more than a couple of years before we had it all assimilated and we understood what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Well, not everything, but nobody else did. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">But, we understood, I think, far more than we would have if we hadn't been occupied.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">QUESTION:  What do you remember about the German occupation? </span><span class="sentence" id="214">How it began? </span><span class="sentence" id="215">What were you doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">ANSWER:  1940, May 10, 4:00 in the morning, my father came and shook me and said, boy, let's go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , it's war. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And I heard anti-aircraft cannons, I heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> flying overhead. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And then we heard some bombs falling. </span><span class="sentence" id="219"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> wasn't severely bombed, but the Germans did bomb <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> the first day of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I guess, more as a scare tactic than actual, you know, aim at destruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And I remember that as if 1t was yesterday. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And from then on, just about everything that occurred during the occupation 1s in my computer. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And it comes back when, you know, when I think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I remember being a very bad boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Stealing my mother's very scarce sugar and putting it into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gas tanks</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German trucks</span> that were parked in the <span class="DLF">street</span> in the front of my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">We were a little group of kids and one of them would be watching the sentry and he was going up the <span class="DLF">street</span> , we would immediately go and unscrew the caps and pour the sugar in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And, you know, that gums up the engines, makes a mess of the engine. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And I remember being kicked in the rear end by a couple of Femp(ph) Polezei(ph) who were searching us and, I guess, as I say, I must have been ornery because I probably talked back to him and he really, I can still feel the pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And one time I was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Street car</span> and there was, unfortunately, there were a few traitors as you know, in all the <span class="REGION">occupied countries</span> , including Belgtum. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And it was the 21st of July, which is a Belgian national day, and I was carrying a little black, yellow and red flag, which is the Belgian colors, in my lapel. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Very obvious. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And one of those traitors came up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> and said, why do you have that on your lapel? </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And I said, why do you have it on that, I'm not going to say the word, but thats uniform that you're wearing? </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And he slapped me in the face and I fell out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">I almost got killed by it, but I wasn't really injured. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">But, I think the traitors were worse sometimes than the actual Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I couldn't stand his arrogance, and I talked back, I must have been about 13 at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And, as I say, you learn very fast during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And you learn things you maybe you shouldn't be learning, like bad words and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">But, yeah, I remember the occupation extremely vividly for some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Maybe a half a block from where we were was a, one of the rare <span class="BUILDING">skyscrapers</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> and there lived three German generals there. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And I remember very well going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and seeing those gentlemen, quote unquote, come down the <span class="DLF">steps</span> there with their green capes that were lined in red, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Very, very flashy. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Those were probably too impressive for me to insult because for some reason, even an enemy general is still a general, I suppose, you don't say bad things to a general. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">But, I remember that as if it were yesterday. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">It's something that stays with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">QUESTION:  Was their presence ominous?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">We had the same reflex that the Germans had in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> under Hitler's day that always look behind us to see if we weren't being followed. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And, yeah, the presence was heavy. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And they made their presence known. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Like, every Saturday, they had a victory parade. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Every Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">A victory parade in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And they would parade in front of the <span class="BUILDING">royal palace</span> and then stop there and have a band concert. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And they were pretty obvious. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">As I say, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street cars</span> , you had to be careful what you said because there were always some ears that shouldn't hear what you were saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Oh, I remember, for example, one day I was, that was probably toward the end of the war, must have been '44, I was standing on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> there and a man was seated <span class="NPIP">inside</span> reading a newspaper and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> stopped and the Germans came aboard and started searching people. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And everybody had to put their hands up. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And this man very, very casually, very quietly, took a pistol out of his inside pocket, put it in his newspaper and went like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">The Germans searched him but didn't look inside his newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And he was never found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">But, you know, you had to be very careful of what you said and what you didn't say.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  Is he ready? </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">QUESTION:  I want to get a better picture of what life was like once the Germans came into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">How your life, personally, changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  Well, the first few months, there really weren't that many changes. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Because they tried to go easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And, as I said to you previously, we had a military governor. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">We did not have a Golighter(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="277">We didn't have an SS general at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">We only had one general who was an anti-Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">General Alexander from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Falkenhausen(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Who was an old Prussian aristocrat who actually was pretty friendly to the Belgians. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">So, the first few months were not all that bad actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Except for the obvious presence of the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">The parades and all that sort of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And, of course, the rationing. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">The scarcity of essentials. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Which, actually, became much, much worse as of probably 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">In 1940 and 1941, I can't say that we were that miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">But in 1942, then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> realized that the military governor was not being strong enough, was not being harsh enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And we received then, an SS man who sort of took over the, quote, political aspect. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">In other words, diminishing all the powers of the army which in itself wasn't all that bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">That's when things began to change very drastically. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">The day-to-day life for us became pretty difficult as far as food is concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Various supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">There was no gasoline for my father's little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> which he kept, as a doctor was able to keep. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">But there was no fuel for it so that didn't do much good. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And then, we began to see things changing even more drastically. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">That's when we saw people being taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">We hadn't quite yet realized why they were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">We thought maybe they had done some bad things. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And were being put in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And then, pretty quickly, it became obvious that they were mostly Jewish people, as well as Belgians who had either something to do with the Resistance or simply hostages. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">People who were not Jewish that hadn't really done anything bad, were taken as hostages in reprisal for various acts of resistance and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Or for having hidden resistance or people who were resistant to the forced labor that, of course, was imposed. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">That's another thing that didn't come immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Forced labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Young people taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> forcibly to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Not necessarily to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , but to <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Being paid a measly salary and living in squalor and terrible conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And, of course, it didn't take long before the young people understood what was going on and they went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Electricity became limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">We would have power cut off after, say, 8:00 at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Curfews, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">That began pretty early in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Curfews were established, but they weren't strictly enforced. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Again, it was still the army at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">But, as soon as the SS and Gestapo police came, those things were strictly enforced. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And if you were out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> at 8:30, you immediately went to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">You know, not just getting a ticket or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">You were taken to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">There was hardly any coal for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotives</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Except for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And then I saw, with my own eyes, the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jewish transports</span> that I ever saw, at the end of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">At first I didn't realize what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">But, I saw lots of people being packed in, they weren't yet using <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">They were using very old third class <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> with, which were boarded, the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were boarded up. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And, but the people were still sitting on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">They weren't yet packed 100 or 120 in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">But, I saw them because there was a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> only about three or four blocks from my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> were down and so you could see from a little <span class="DLF">wall</span> and there were <span class="DLF">iron gates</span> , if you want, you could see through the <span class="DLF">gates</span> what was going on down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And I saw this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> where people were pushed in with little package or suitcase or bundle of some sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And then I was told by somebody who worked there, you know, who these are? </span><span class="sentence" id="334">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Well, these are Jewish people that are taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">That's the first time I ever saw a transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And I remember that as if it was yesterday. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">What else? </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Well, of course, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was down completely as far as activity is concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">There were some <span class="BUILDING">movie theaters</span> playing German movies and propaganda, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">All English or American or French movies were outlawed. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I don't think I ever went to a real movie until 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">When, just after the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">My father just didn't want us to go to, to go see that thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Then after World War II, interestingly enough, I was able to see a number of those propaganda movies, but that's neither here nor there. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">During the war, there were no candies, you know, for kids that was important. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Chocolate was still being made, but taken by the German army, most of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">As I say, the food was tolerably abundant for the first two years, but then after 1942, things began to go very badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">We probably, we had a loaf of bread for the five of us for a day or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Sometimes maybe twice a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Meat was rarely, rarely available. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">We were extremely lucky in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> that, almost been called a miracle, in 1943, because for some reason, an enormous bank of herring began to swim right off the Belgian coast. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Within a mile or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing boats</span> were allowed two <span class="DLF">lines</span> , so they were allowed to go and fish those herring. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And for about six months that sustained the Belgian people as far as protein is concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And I still remember my poor mother, you know, getting up at 4:00 in the morning, waiting until 10:00 or 11:00 in <span class="DLF">line</span> , standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Sometimes I went with her when I wasn't in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And getting two or three measly herrings, but at least we had that. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">My mother had to learn close to 100 different recipes so we would still eat those because after you've had herring every day for six months, you just don't want to ever see another herring in your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">But it saved us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">QUESTION:  What about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">ANSWER: <span class="BUILDING"> School</span> , at first there was no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">But it started again in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">You know, the war began in May, it started again in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And the first year it was <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">But then it didn't take long before all the books were censored and only the Nazi controlled versions were allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">We were, that was mostly in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">But, we were allowed to learn English after we had learned German first. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">It sounded awful at the time, but in a way it was blessing in disguise, because when I finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and all my classmates the same way, we could speak Latin, Greek, French, Flemish, German and English. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Which has served me well, you know, later in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">So, I guess I owe that to the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">But, I'm not grateful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">QUESTION:  You've spoken about some of the ways in which your life was changed by the occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Were you aware of the different kinds of restrictions on Jewish people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">ANSWER:  As I say, after 1942, we began to realize what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And we saw some of our friends being taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And then it dawned upon us, oh, that's why they're, you know, they're taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Because they are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">As I told you before, we didn't even have an inkling before World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">We didn't ask the people which, you know, where do you go? </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Do you go to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> or do you go to a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">If they went to a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> , we would see them because they would go to the same one we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">But, the other people who were not in our <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , we didn't ask them what they did or where they went or what, and you know, if they had no religion at all, so what, that was fine, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Yeah, we began to see and I have somewhere in my file, I have a picture of a transport taken by a friend of my father's who was a doctor, too, from his <span class="DLF">office window</span> which was just above the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where they took the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So he took a picture, this was obviously forbidden, but he did anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">They didn't catch him. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">We still have that picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="388">QUESTION:  Were they wearing the yellow star?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="389">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">As of 1942, we began to see the yellow stars. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And, of course, at that time, it became quite obvious. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Then in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , for example, Jews were not allowed to walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I have a picture of that, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">They were forced to walk in the <span class="DLF">gutter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And when it was dry it didn't matter that much, except it was humiliating. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">But when it was raining they had their feet in the water which wasn't all that pleasant, particularly during the war when we didn't have any good shoes anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Many shoes were made out of cardboard and they would just fall apart in that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">If that had been the only misery, I suppose they might have survived it, even though resenting it. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">But, that was only the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">The yellow star, there were a number of people who in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> , would ostentatiously get up and give their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> to a person wearing a yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Particularly if there were German officers or German soldiers on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">They would deliberately show, you know, say, please take my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I wouldn't say everybody did that, but there were people who did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I've seen it happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">QUESTION:  What was the reaction from the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">ANSWER:  Very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">They wouldn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">You know, actually, the individual German, particularly the army people, were rather, I wouldn't say scared, but they weren't particularly ageressive when alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">As I said before, the, this traitor there was probably more aggressive than the German army people. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Now, I'm not talking about the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">But we didn't see the SS all that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">They were always in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">They hardly ever were on foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">The people on foot were mostly the soldiers and they were sort of well restrained in their attitudes, except when they were asked to do a search. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And, you know, to line people up against a <span class="DLF">wall</span> and search them and that sort of thing, which is how I got my kick in the butt. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">In general, the population was very understanding and sympathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Now, there were a few bad ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And I'm not going to deny that. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I'm not proud of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Nobody is. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">But, 1t wasn't as bad as in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I can assure you of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">We could see that a number of <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> where we had been shopping regularly for either food or clothes or that sort of thing, were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">There was nobody there any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And, actually, the Germans did not, as much as they did in their own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , take over the Jewish businesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">QUESTION:  So, you were telling me about the general climate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  And you said that most of the Belgian public was supportive of, I guess, the Jewish population?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And, as a matter of fact, anything that had to do with being against the Bosch(ph), as we said, you know, was in favor of most of the Belgian population at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">They, you will hear people say that, oh, there were some very bad people and, as I said, it's true, the largest newspaper in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> was actually Nazi controlled completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">But, interestingly enough, it was Jewish owned. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">But the owner went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , so the paper was taken over by pro-Nazi people. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">The other large, the other two largest papers, the Socialist one and the Catholic ones, just shut down. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">They didn't publish any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">So the only paper we really had was Neswah(ph) which is the evening, although it was published in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Which was Nazi controlled entirely. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Interestingly, a little anecdote, on the 21st of July, I think it was in 1943, which is the national day of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , there was a false Swah(ph) distributed which had been printed and put out by the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And, at first, it was so well made that people didn't realize it was not the real one. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And they just took it and then you could see the people picking up the paper and their jaws dropping because all the things that were said there, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">We shall win and we'll crush the Bosch and naming all the traitors and that sort of thing, and people started reading and reading and sometimes giggling because some funny stories were written in there, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And that was a day of levity during World War II when the entire city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> was covered with Neswah, but not the real one. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Which was, of course, much more real than the Nazi controlled one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">QUESTION:  You speak of the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">How apparent was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">ANSWER:  It became fairly, for me, it became fairly apparent because right in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we had a housekeeper who worked as a concierge(ph) 1f you want, cleaned the <span class="INT_SPACE">entrance hallway</span> where my father's patients would come because in Europe, many doctors had their <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , it was very common. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And so did my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And her son was a career soldier in the Belgian Army, was taken war prisoner, and when he came back, immediately joined one of the earliest resistant movements and it was impossible for her to hide it from her, from us, because he had to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> occasionally to get, you know, clothes and that sort of thing and he would come at night, sometimes after the curfew, but he never got caught there. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">So, I became quickly aware that there was something going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And so did my sister and brother who were much younger than I, but they knew, oh, Roger was here again. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Roger, Roger. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Yeah, Roger was in the resistance and well, actually, Roger had a little brother who was exactly my age and slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> and at 4:00 one night, my mother came and shook me and said, hurry up, open the <span class="DLF">back windows</span> and hurry up, the Germans are at the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And Roger was in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at that time with his brother, sleeping in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Which was, of course, on purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">He immediately ran out the <span class="DLF">roof windows</span> , you know those <span class="DLF">roof windows</span> in Europe where you can lift like a trap, the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and he ran out that way and was able to escape and the Germans came and found the little brother in the warm <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , but, you know, they had no way of telling there was another guy there. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">So, they searched the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , these were SS, it was Gestapo, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And they searched the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , didn't find anything, they were very careful not to leave any traces of his passage. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And after that, he never came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">It must have been later in the war, 1t must have been 1943 or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And, so we were quite aware of a resistance movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I don't think we made any distinction between the Jewish resistance and non-Jewish resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">That probably would have been a little too complicated for us to understand at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">But then, when my uncle, when Father Bruno came into the picture, and that was late 1942 or early '43, for me, then we began to see things quite differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">We, he didn't say anything, you know, he was very, very quiet and never said a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">He never said, I am helping Jewish children escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">But, after two or three or five had gone through my other uncle's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I was there quite often, you know, you can be 13 and still think, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And at that point, I realized things were going on that were not at all, quote, normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And I didn't say anything, but you put two and two together at age 12 or 13, just as you can when you're an adult. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And it's from that time on that my uncle, Father Bruno, became perhaps less secretive with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">I was one of the oldest nephews and I was, by far, the one he was closest to. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And so he became less secretive in the sense that he would give me a letter to take to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> or there would be a child I had never seen and he said, oh, this is a friend of mine and his name is Robert, maybe his name was Abraham, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">But, and, do you know where such and such <span class="DLF">street</span> is? </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Yes, I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Well, why don't you take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> and go to such and such <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there and tell them that Robert is looking for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And that's all he ever said. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">You know, he never said, Robert is Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And Robert always had a war name, a different name. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">One of the kids that I knew particularly well, is alive and well and we called him Roger. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Roger Dumois(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And I actually lived with him, more or less, for at least six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">In my other uncle's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , my younger uncle, the dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Jean(ph), who worked in very close cooperation with Father Bruno. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">That was my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he was the only child of my grandmother's who stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">family home</span> after he was married because he occupied my grandfather's <span class="BUILDING">medical office</span> as a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">So he didn't have to look for another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and my grandmother just took the <span class="INT_SPACE">upper floor</span> for herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And so, the kids were brought there frequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I, one day I entered without warning into my grandmother's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and there were eight kids sitting, seated there on eight <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> , she had a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> because she had a lot of children. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Each of them had a glass of milk in his hand and, of course, I immediately put two and two together but nobody said anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">She says, Oh, we're just having a little party. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And there were eight Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">One of whom stayed and, it was a funny incident because he was playing with matches and almost set fire to my grandmother's curtains. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">But she got the fire under control pretty rapidly. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">But, this is how I, you know, I realized what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And then my uncle Bruno, Henry, Henry was his real name. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Father Bruno was his religion name, would come in civilian clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I had never seen him in civilian clothes, couldn't understand why he was doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">But, after a while, of course, we realized he had to because the Germans were after him. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And he had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and he would occasionally ring the bell quite late at night and hide his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and disappear in the middle of the night while we were, I frequently slept at my younger uncle's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because he had a, there was a better heating system in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> than in my parent's second <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which I didn't like anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And, so I did get to see quite a number of the proteges, as my uncle used to call them. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And, okay, what else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">QUESTION:  Well, since you mentioned this boy that you actually lived with for quite some time, this Jewish boy, I'm just curious if you, what it was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Was he scared? </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Did you talk about things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">ANSWER:  I must honestly say that life went on pretty normally. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">There was a feeling of security in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Everybody felt pretty safe and secure in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">He went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with me to the <span class="BUILDING">College</span> , of course, where else? </span><span class="sentence" id="508">It happens that that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> is only about three or four blocks away from my grandparent's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which 1s the main reason why everybody went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And so we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together and sometimes we didn't see each other during the day because we were not in the same class. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">But, usually at 4:00, which was dismissal time, we would wait for each other at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and just go on <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as if nothing had happened, and as if nothing was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Jumping like kids do, you know, and kicking a can once in awhile and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And he looked pretty happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">It's only actually towards the very, very end of the war when I think he had an inkling that his parents had disappeared, that he became a little more sad and more, less expansive, less talkative. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">But, for a good while there, we were just like two old buddies and playing games like you see kids do and doing our homework together and that sort of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">QUESTION:  Did he talk about what happened to his parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">QUESTION:  Or why he was hiding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Actually, that was one thing that Father Bruno stressed upon them, to never talk about, never, your name is Joe Blow now, you don't have any parents, you are not Jewish, you are of Flemish descent, and your parents are travelling in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Or your parents are dead, you know, or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">But, dead from other causes he meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">No, that was one thing he was very, very strong and stern about. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Do not ever talk about your family and things that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">So, even in my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , there was no such talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">End of tape #2 Tape #3 ..down a little bit, they might be a little...
ANSWER:  Well, they're already down. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">No, I don't mean that, I mean, I'm saying you can tip it back a little.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">ANSWER:  I was going to say, if I point them more down, they'll be... Yeah, I know they were too high.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">QUESTION:  I just wanted to pick up where we stopped for a moment, because it was at the end of the tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">QUESTION:  You were telling me about this Jewish boy who was hiding at your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Roger.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">QUESTION:  Roger. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And that while, when he maybe learned more about his family, he became...
ANSWER:  Sulky, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">QUESTION:  But I was asking you whether, at any point, you ever talked to him about what was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">QUESTION:  What was going on in the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">That was a no-no. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And it was on specific instructions by Father Bruno to not talk about events surrounding the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Any child that was under his protection, 1f you want to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">It just was too risky. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">You know, one unfortunate word and it could have caused the death, not only of the child, but everybody around the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">So, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">As little talk as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">How do you say that? </span><span class="sentence" id="548">The enemy has ears everywhere? </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">We were very aware of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And at that time, when I began to work a little closer to Father Bruno, I was already, well, a young teenager at that time, I was mostly, well almost 13 and 13, and I began to understand, you just don't talk about things of importance during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Now, on the contrary, we had a little club, if you want, of school kids, we thought of ourselves as very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And we had a club which was our resistance club. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">It didn't do much resistance, but we were organized as a military club. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">There was a colonel and there was a couple of majors and a couple of captains and if you did well, 1f you, for example, you could report on seeing so many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German trucks</span> going by, then you got promoted. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And if you had counted how many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">B-17's</span> are flying over our heads, then you got a promotion or a decoration or a commendation of some sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">We had to know by heart, all the types of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> , enemy or friendly, and we had exams given by the colonel, you know, and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">It didn't amount to anything, it was just games, but to give you the spirit of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And we would hide in the, somebody's <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> so the Germans wouldn't hear us. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">It was very secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">That was mostly, actually, before 1943, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">When I was still a little more innocent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">QUESTION:  Did you every do any little, you mentioned putting the sugar in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gas tanks</span> ...
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">That was part of our assignments. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">If we did that, that was a great big promotion because, if you did that, you know, you took a bad risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And you could be promoted from second lieutenant all the way to major for doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And when my mother found out about that, was she every unhappy. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Not so much for the sugar, but for the risk I was taking. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And even though these were not SS, I'm sure if they had caught us, they would have definitely called our parents, maybe put our parents in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , and that sort of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">QUESTION:  Were there other little sabotage activities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">ANSWER:  Well, yeah, flat tires and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">For some reason, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> would suddenly develop a flat tire. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I had a couple of friends who were specialists of that, they would have a little stick of wood and put that in the, what do you call this valve, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Where they inflate the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tire</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Push it in and there's a little peg in there that if you push it in, the <span class="DLF">air</span> goes out. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">So, when nobody was looking, he would just push a little piece of wood in there and slowly the <span class="DLF">air</span> would go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And the next morning the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> had a flat tire. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And, but again, all that didn't amount to much. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">But, it's just the spirit, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">We, it was a spirit of resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">In our childish way, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Go ahead, I'm sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="585">QUESTION:  Was that spirit of resistance fairly prevalent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">ANSWER:  Well, I can only speak about my own environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I would say that in my own environment, it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">It was, you know, in World War I, my grandparents had been very, very miserable and badly treated by the occupant, so that was still lingering. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And, the eight children, except perhaps for the last one, had lived through that war with the spirit, let's get rid of the Bosch, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And it was still there 25 years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">You just don't get rid of that sort of resentment so easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And, so it wasn't at all difficult for us to pick up because that spirit had already been imparted to us between the wars. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">You know, when they were telling stories, oh, do you remember so and so? </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Do you remember when general so and so got beaten by the French and da, da, da. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">So, we were living, see <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> has been occupied by foreign powers ever since Julius Caesar and, you know, Belgians have become, for that reason, exceedingly independent minded people. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And it's only since 1830, that <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> has become a political entity of its own, a free, independent <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And then, but we, we have an ancestral tradition of hating the occupant. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">You know, from Julius Caesar to the Franks to the Spaniards to the Austrians, the French and then the Germans again. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And, yeah, that spirit of anti-occupant was very prevalent in my environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">It's difficult for me to judge, you know, how it was in other families. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">But, the families that we knew were on our side, if I may say. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">We never, I never, never knew, personally, anyone who was not anti-Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">On the contrary, my father had several excellent friends who suffered greatly during the war because of their anti-Nazi attitudes and actions. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">One of them died in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , the other one was killed by the SS on the last day of the occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">He was, they came with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and started shooting blindly around and he got hit by a machine gun bullet and was killed about five minutes after my father had said good-bye to him for the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And then there was the governor of the <span class="BUILDING">national bank</span> who was giving funds to Father Bruno for his children. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And one day, three or four Nazi thugs came and rang his doorbell and said, are you Mr. Gallopan(ph)? </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And he said, yes, [machine gun sounds], they just machine gunned him right on his <span class="DLF">doorstep</span> , right in front of his wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="609">QUESTION:  Because of his efforts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">ANSWER:  Because of his support of the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">You know, Father Bruno needed enormous amounts of money to be able to feed and clothe his children. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And he didn't have anything, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And so, he went to Mr. Gallopan who was a notorious anti-German, even though they had left him as president of the <span class="BUILDING">national bank</span> knowing that he was not, he didn't like them. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">So, he went to this man and this man committed himself to giving him a certain sum of money, I don't remember how much it was, every month. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And my other uncle, one of my other uncles by marriage, Uncle Jack, was the one who collected the money from the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> every month and kept the books. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Kept the accounting. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And when Mr. Gallopan was killed, someone else in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> honored his promise and they continued to deliver money until the end of the wat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">QUESTION:  I do want to learn a lot more about this whole rescue effort, but I'd like you to tell me a bit more about what you did. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Your involvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="620">ANSWER:  Well, I don't want to, you know, I've never been for self aggrandizement. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">All I ever did, as I told you in this film before, 1s carry little letters and escort children from one <span class="NPIP">point</span> to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I was too young to do anything else at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">So, that was my contribution, if you want, being a messenger.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">QUESTION:  Do you remember specifically...
ANSWER:  And also being a school mate, which probably brought a little comfort to Roger, among others.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">QUESTION:  Do you remember specifics of some of your messengering and escorting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">ANSWER:  Well, the one picture I keep is my standing on the <span class="DLF">rear platform</span> of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> with my arms stretched out on the <span class="DLF">railing</span> , on the back thing, and a Jewish child looking at me with a cap on his head, hiding his dark hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And my hair was light blond, very light blond, I was a perfect Aryan. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And we were just playing, you know, being silly kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">With my blue eyes and my blond hair, the Germans would, there would be a few Germans on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street cars</span> , but they would probably just take one look at me and just, you know, ignore me. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And that was one picture that I remember very, very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Another incident was that, at that time, I was carrying a letter, but I was with my aunt, the wife of the dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Of Jean, my aunt Ninette(ph), one of the women I have most loved in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And I was there with her and we were trying to find an address, and we couldn't find the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And at one point, there were Germans 1n the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">They weren't looking for us, but she got scared and we ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And then she said, you know, I shouldn't have run away because that may give us away. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I should have just said, and I said, well, let me go back by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">They're not going to bother me. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And I went back and I finally did find that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , rang the doorbell and delivered the letter, ran like heck out of there to find my aunt again. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And she was waiting around the corner on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">That's, those are two incidents I do remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">QUESTION:  How much did you know about what you were doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="643">ANSWER:  Well, I've been trying to explain that, you know, it grew gradually. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">At first, we didn't really know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Certainly not before 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And even in 1942, early in the game, we were only sensing something was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And it was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">But, we couldn't pinpoint what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">But even at, you know, the ripe old age of 12 or 13, during the war, there are things that you perceive that you would not normally otherwise perceive. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And it didn't take very long, as I said I think previously on this tape, that, you know, I put two and two together and began to realize how important it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And what was the purpose of all these kids coming and going. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And some I would never see again, some I would see again, maybe two or three months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">That would be when a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> would be blown for example, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Then Father Bruno had to go get the child back. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">People were talking or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Some unfortunate circumstance had taken place and, well, you know, I have my little six year old grandson here and I'm amazed at how much a little six year old can perceive already. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">So I'm sure that at 12 or 13, all of us were much more aware than people thought we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Even though Father Bruno never said the word, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">QUESTION:  So you weren't given much information? </span><span class="sentence" id="660">You didn't talk about it with your uncles or...
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">The only thing that was talked to or talked about was where to go put a letter and where to take a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">That was all. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Not at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Even though, you know, I'm sure that if I had been put under torture, I would have certainly said what I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">You know, at 12 or 13, you don't resist torture, you have to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I'm sure I couldn't have withstood torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">It never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">I was very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">But I'm sure I would have given them more information than everybody else thought I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And I had a couple of cousins who were about my age, who knew almost as much as I did, even though they weren't quite so close to Father Bruno because they lived in a different <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in a different part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">But nevertheless, they weren't fools, they knew what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="674">QUESTION:  You said you were asked to escort some of these kids to <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">What kind of <span class="NPIP">places</span> did you take them to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">ANSWER:  Just families. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Just mostly families. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Occasionally a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , or occasionally a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but most of the time, families. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And I cannot be sure of that, but I believe that one time I took a child to this extraordinary lady who helped Father Bruno with at least 50 of the children, and was, never asked for any payment except for her train fare and an occasional lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And I think I met her then, but that's a little fuzzy in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I can't be absolutely sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Mostly, these were families or private persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">QUESTION:  What did you talk about with the kids you were transporting? </span><span class="sentence" id="684">You were, how did you transport them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">ANSWER:  On foot or in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> , public transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street cars</span> were the only public transportation available, there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">busses</span> , no gasoline. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And, I think we would just talk about usual kid stuff, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="688"><span class="BUILDING">School</span> or maybe talk about the people around us. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Talking about, you know, games or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I think we would just talk about ordinary things. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Never, definitely never, about deportation, about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or all that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Of course, we didn't know much about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">But, not at that time we didn't, but we would never say, oh, your uncle so and so went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">What happened to him? </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">That was forbidden.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">QUESTION:  Did you have a sense of their fear or trepidation or...
ANSWER:  Occasionally, some kids were pretty antsy, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Occasionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Some of them would be kind of, you know, looking around and checking to see if they were being followed and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Mostly the older ones, I mean older, I mean 8, 9, 10 year olds. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Not a four or five year olds. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">But, I think that, yeah, some of the older kids were scared, obviously scared.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">QUESTION:  Did you have to say something to them so they wouldn't give themselves away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="704">ANSWER:  Well, we tried to, I don't know, what do you do when somebody's scared? </span><span class="sentence" id="705">You try to talk about something else, distract them, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">That's all we could do, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Or we would just try to interrupt their train of thought by pointing at something, oh, look at that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I had, this had nothing to do with Father Bruno, but I had a classmate whose mother was killed in the bombing, bombing by the Americans, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And every time there was an air raid, he would literally go into a trance, into hysterics. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And there was nothing we could do to, you know, to calm him down. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">He would just shake all over and perspire and moan and he never got over that. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">He never recovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">In fact, he died rather miserably ten years ago or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And, so there were times where you couldn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">But this never actually happened to me with one of kids I was escorting. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">QUESTION:  What about the risk to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Was this exciting? </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Was this like a big adventure? </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Or were you a little bit nervous? </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I mean, you were taking risks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">ANSWER:  You're 12, 13 year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">You don't think of risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">You don't think of, you think of it as, you think of it as a new adventure. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">You think of it as something different, you know, outside of going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and doing your homework and going to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and have breakfast and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Suddenly, there was something, and you had, you know, sort of a feeling of being useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Because they were calling upon you to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">You were no longer the little child playing with his little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toy cars</span> in the corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">You know, you were part of the responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">So, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Well, of course, we knew about some, something of the risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">We knew to avoid the Germans as much as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">But that was even before. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">I mean, we tried to avoid the Germans, when we saw a group of Germans on the <span class="DLF">street corner</span> , we immediately changed course and took another <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Even before 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">We just didn't want to, you know, that was, that kind of risk we knew we shouldn't take, we weren't supposed to take a risk by going too close to the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Oh, that's something we acquired immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And our parents certainly re-emphasized that, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">It's interesting because my first exposure with the Nazi military was before World War II and I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> with my parents in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that's right at the <span class="DLF">border</span> , the <span class="DLF">German border</span> , called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reinfelden(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="743">There's a lovely <span class="DLF">bridge</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> is a Swiss guard and on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> is a German guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And I was, I think, seven or eight years old at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And, you know, like any kid, I ran on the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> and the Swiss soldier stopped me and said in French, because he'd heard we'd spoke French, he says, don't go there, this guy is bad on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">So, the Swiss didn't like the Nazis any more than we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Even though they spoke German in that <span class="REGION">area</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">QUESTION:  Did you, were your activities secret even from your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">No, my parents knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">In fact, we had three Jewish people in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in a row, I mean, success, 1n succession. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">We had first, I think the first one was a Polish girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Blond, Polish girl who was a little ornery. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">She was a bit difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">She didn't want to be cooped up. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And, in fact, she left us. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">To go with a Belgian policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">The last we heard, she was working as a, I don't know what you call it, a call girl or something in a <span class="BUILDING">tavern</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Not far from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Where German officers went. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">I guess that fact that she was blond and blue eyed didn't tip off the Germans that she was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Then we had a large German, no, yes, German woman, but from <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And she was very, very scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">She was very, very scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">She stayed with us for about, I think, three months and then Father Bruno came and took her out and took her away. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And then we had another woman and she told us all kinds of funny stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">She told us the stories of Laurel and Hardy movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">In French. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And on the Liberation Day, September 3, 1944, she ran to her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , picked up her suitcase, she only had one suitcase, packed up, ran out the <span class="DLF">door</span> and we never saw her again. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">I don't know what happened to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">She was just so elated she was free again, that she just ran out the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">So that was the last, the last one I ever saw actually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="774">QUESTION:  So a number of, how many? </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Three.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">A number of people in your families, in your family, hid Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Is that what you're saying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="779">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">The nuns did in their <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liesch(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="782">The other nun, who was at that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , no, no, she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlovese(ph</span> ), another small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="783">That <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> also hid a couple of kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">My parents did. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">My father did surgery on a couple of Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Another anecdote. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">He had a small child who had appendicitis, put him in the open <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> because that's the way <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> were at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Maybe 20 patients in an open <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And, believe it or not, a German soldier had a bad car accident right in front of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="790">So, instead of taking him to the <span class="BUILDING">military hospital</span> which was the other side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , they took him to my <span class="INT_SPACE">father's ward</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">So, at one end we had the Jewish child with appendicitis, at the other <span class="NPIP">end</span> we had an injured German soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">But, you know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="793">It turned out to be a sort of a protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Because this guy was there lying, he was there for at least a week before they transported him to the <span class="BUILDING">military hospital</span> , well, there was a constant flow of friends and officers coming to comfort him and bring him candy and flowers and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">They wouldn't pay any attention to the rest of the <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And there wouldn't be any searches during that time.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="803">ANSWER:  Not specifically aimed at Father Bruno's network. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">More like the general population. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">For example, we had a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I didn't like the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but that's neither here nor there, it used to belong, a hundred years ago, no a hundred and fifty years ago, to twin brothers who were wine merchants and they had <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> that were two level <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> , like in a sub-<span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , if you want, <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and sub-<span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="807">All of these were vaulted, almost like a <span class="BUILDING">cathedral</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And because of that, we had the visit of the air defense people who came and looked at our <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they said, well, this 1s a pretty safe <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="809">It can probably resist most of the normal bombs that were available in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">Would you be willing to open that up to the public? </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And so, yes there were numbers of people from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> who would come during air raids and, actually, it turned out sometimes to be a rather, rather fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Because they would bring their food and we would share their food and we would share with them our food. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And in that <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , I must tell you, that there were still some bottle of wine. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And I'm sure the neighbors enjoyed those quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">And there was an air intake, a sort of a column about a foot and a half in diameter which let the <span class="DLF">air</span> in and opened up in our <span class="DLF">back yard</span> and I was the air raid signaler. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">I was in charge of listening if I could hear the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and if I did, I would say, they are coming, they are coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And also to warn them when it was the end of alarm signal, so everybody could go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="819">That was my duty at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">So, this is a memory I keep, you know, very vivid. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And other than that, well, yeah, distributing whatever little food we had to some other people who had even less. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">My mother did that, but she did that mostly as part of her duties in that blind people organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And my great aunt, who was my mother's aunt, was also the president of that same organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">Took me around a number of times during the war to help her carry packages and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">But that wasn't, you know, was not directly connected to saving the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">That was mostly just ordinary being nice to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Oh, I might mention that even though my wife's family had no connection with the Jewish movement, they did hide non-Jewish resistance in their <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="829">That gave rise to a rather hair raising occasion because one of them also got appendicitis, but how are you going to get that guy out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> when, you know, in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where everyone knew everything about everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">So, what they did, they waited until it was dark, called the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> , had my wife's sister climb on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> with the guy, covering both of them so that only her head would be visible, put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> and took the whole thing to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="831">So, of course, my sister- in-law had to stay away from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for at least a week because they kept people in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for at least a week after appendectomy in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And then to bring the man back was another thing because at that time he could walk so it wasn't so difficult, but again, they had to be very careful at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And there was an asthmatic woman living right across, because those were <span class="BUILDING">row houses</span> , and she would always open her <span class="DLF">window</span> during the night to take a breath of fresh air. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And they had to wait until she closed the <span class="DLF">window</span> before any movement could occur in the <span class="DLF">street</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">QUESTION:  Let's get back to your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">Your immediate family. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">You started to tell me who all was involved in this rescue operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="838">ANSWER:  Who, well. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Father Bruno was the driving force. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">The leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">He was also the person having no children who adamantly said that he was taking all the responsibility on his back. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Whether that would have served, you know, or helped, I'm not sure because the Nazis were smarter than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">But, at least he said, I want to take all the responsibility and I will have you help me, but I will never mention you or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">But he got his mother involved, my grandmother, my father, who was a surgeon. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">My younger uncle who was a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">My uncle by marriage who was the finance man. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And his three sisters who were nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">But, that was only a very small part of the network. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">Because he had to have a lot more help than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">So, he got quite a number of assistants either permanently or occasionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Some of them were Jewish, some of them were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">He did all kinds of visits himself to the families where he wanted the children to be hidden and in the little book that we wrote there is that famous story of the University professor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louvan(ph</span> ), Belgtum who was a devout Catholic and my uncle went to see him and told him all that was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And the man said, you know, I honestly am not aware of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">But, my duty as a Christian is to help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">When are you going to bring me a child? </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And, you know, that sort of thing, of course, was very comforting for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">He said when he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> after the war, that no one actually shut the <span class="DLF">door</span> on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">So, he did have a few, well, misadventures where some kid didn't get along with a family or, particularly, adults sometimes were a little independent and the family would consider them as being servants. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">And they wouldn't like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">So, there were a few, but I would say not more than five or six such incidents occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And the vast majority of the people were just welcoming and opened their arms, you know, and their families to Father Bruno. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">But I would say that there were probably more than several hundred people involved eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Because you know, three hundred twenty and maybe more children, we don't know exactly how many there were, Flora thinks, Flora Singer, thinks there was about three hundred and fifty. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">That may be a little too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">We don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Because, obviously, for security reasons, Father Bruno couldn't keep accurate records during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">So all the records he had were little notes he made in a certain code which, after the war, he then transferred to a more elaborate ledger. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And so he lost track of a few of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">So we know for sure of about three hundred and twenty. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And since each child probably had to be moved, one, two, three, up to five times, well, just count and you'll see that would imply probably something like a thousand transfers. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="872">Not, there were sometimes the same families taking different children. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">But, most of the time they, you know when there was too much talking or too much something going on that might give it away, he had to find new families all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And so, his personal network included probably the eight or nine people of his family and as many close collaborators or friends as that. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">Like eight or nine, maybe ten. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Close associates. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">But, then, you know, there were hundreds of families that were involved that should not be forgotten or neglected. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">You know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="879">QUESTION:  How did he get into this? </span><span class="sentence" id="880">What, I mean, yes, he was a good man, but how did he initially get involved with this rescue operation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="881">ANSWER:  Well, that was sort of a happenstance because he was sent as a chaplain, he was requested to come as a chaplain, in a small <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for the blind in the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hodbomo(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="882">And when he got there he discovered that there were some blind children, but that most of the occupants there were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">Including the director. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And that, you know, it just, he just saw the light immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">But, he had, in 1938, taken a trip in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="886">I told you that he was a mobile Benedictine and he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> in a busy <span class="DLF">street</span> and he saw people just haggling and harassing or annoying and pushing someone. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And he got closer and he saw an old Jewish man who was dressed like most Orthodox people were with a big black hat and caftan and so on and you know what I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And they were spitting at him and pushing him and that absolutely tore him apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">But, obviously, being in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , he couldn't do a thing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="891">He couldn't go to the rescue of the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">If 1t had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , he probably would have, but not in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And he never forgot that incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And when he got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hodbomo</span> , that little <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for the blind, he said, well, now I realize the full impact of what I saw in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and he decided to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And he didn't help because they were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">He helped because they were people. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">He said, I don't care if they had been Africans, if they had been Japanese, if they had been Papu(ph), I would have done the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">He didn't, perhaps he knew more about the Jews than he did about other people, which made it a little easier for him to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">But, he was mostly concerned about human beings, about people. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And he said, you know, I have to do something to save those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">I don't care what they are, who they are, I have to save those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">They are oppressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">They are persecuted. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">My duty, as a Christian, is to help them and try to save them if I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">Then, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hodbomo</span> , he got in contact with Albert Vandenburg(ph) who was a lawyer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liesch(ph</span> ) and was the executive director of the camps for sickly and destitute children of the archdiocese of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liesch</span> whose bishop was Bishop Kerkopfs(ph) at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And they started working together and Vandenburg was very happy to find someone like Father Bruno who was, you know, free of family, in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Didn't have any children and so on, and was willing to do anything to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And then, unfortunately, Albert Vandenburg was taken by the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">At first for having forged identity cards and that was actually under the jurisdiction of the military government. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And he was condemned to three months in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and he was very happy that he didn't have more than that, get more than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">And he got out of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and the Gestapo was waiting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="912">Took him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">Sent him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen Belsen</span> where he finally, well, nobody exactly knows how or when he died, but he must have died, perhaps even, after the liberation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> of typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">Which was, at that time and even now actually, is a deadly disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And so, Father Bruno took over and went on his own and started his network by contacting various people. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Some of the people he already knew from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> because they were helpers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and this way he was able to place a few children. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">But, the first month I think, he must have had four or five requests in addition to the, oh, I forgot to mention that the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> became very unsafe because in the village people began talking, I'm sure quite innocently, there were no traitors, but they were talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And talking, as I said, is very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">You know, the enemy has ears everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">So, the first thing that Father Bruno and Albert, who was still alive then, had to do was move the children to other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="921">So right there, they had 25 kids that they had to get rid of from that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="922">So they placed those, the early ones, they placed in <span class="BUILDING">convents</span> or, again, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="923">But even that became unsafe because, again, people began talking and there were raids and in one of the raids, there were some adults who were also in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and they were arrested and sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="924">One of the adults who was there was the Grand Rabbi of Liesch, by the name of Lepkifka(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="925">And he escaped but his parents went to and died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And so after the war, he did a lot to publicize the work of Vandenburg and...I'm sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="927">QUESTION:  That's okay, let it go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="928">ANSWER:  What's up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="929">QUESTION:  It's okay, continue please.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="930">ANSWER:  Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">You know, to publicize the work of Vandenburg and, incidentally, of Father Bruno as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">They knew each other quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">As a matter of fact, the sisters who were running the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> were full of praise for the extreme righteousness and religiousness of this rabbi who was very broad minded at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">So, that did a lot to smooth any possible differences that might have occurred under his guidance. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And then you, I think you were asking me how he got to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">Well, then people heard about his work and they came with requests, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">Oh, Mrs. so and so has two children and she would like to place them in safety. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And the first month he got maybe four, five or six of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">Eventually after a few months, I think it was in July of '43, his largest number was, I believe, 24 requests in a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">That doesn't sound like much, but when you realize that he had to go on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> across <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , you know, 24 times to find families to bring papers, to bring food, to bring the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">It was a day and night job. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">You know, he worked 18 hours a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And sometimes more. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">He said after the war that he had crisscrossed Belgrum 40 times the distance that the bicycle racers do for the tour of Belgtum now. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">So, that give you an idea of how much bicycling he did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="946">QUESTION:  What was the involvement of the, or support of the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="947">ANSWER:  Well, in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , as opposed to some of the <span class="REGION">eastern European countries</span> , the majority of the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> was helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">The Cardinal, the Primate of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , Cardinal VanLouie(ph), had directive, if you want, or directions that, to be very cautious. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">But he did several times, issue bulletins saying that, you know, I will not, I will close my eyes if you do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">I will do, I will not interfere if you do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">In other words, he was giving them free rein without saying, I want you to save the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Because that would immediately have put him in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">And he couldn't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And it's the same thing that they said about Pope Pius XXII, this is maybe a controversial subject, but I'm very, very positive on that because my parents were married by Cardinal Mikar(ph) who became a very good friend of them and he became the Secretary of State of Pius XXII, and he told my parents and me, specifically, that the Pope was very sympathetic and that according to the records, the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> itself saved around 20,000 Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Including the Grand Rabbi of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> who was at the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">Now there have been many books written and criticizing him a lot because he didn't do enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">But, again, you know, you have to look at this from different angles. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">It, there is no question that if he had been very, very strong, Hitler was all prepared to invade the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And take the Pope prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">He couldn't have done anything any more at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">So, in other words, what he did 1n a concealed way, was probably more useful than if he had spoken very loudly and been very outspoken about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">They said he was a friend of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">Yes, that's true. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">He had been the Ambassador of the Pope in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> for several years and he really liked the people of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="965">But, he abhorred Nazism. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">In fact, one of his encyclical(ph) letters was directed at the Nazis and condemning it without reservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="967">QUESTION:  One of the reasons I'm asking about <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> in particular is that as we know in many instances, there was a, there were traditional beliefs about Jewish people as traitors, as Christ killers, as whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">And the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> was not always as supportive toward helping Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="969">ANSWER:  Well, you know, let's say that in my environment, it wasn't the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">I cannot speak for all the Belgians, but in my environment, it was not the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">And from what I've been reading and from what I've heard and discussed with other people, this was a lot less prevalent in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> than, for example, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="972">Because in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , even now, there is still a great hostility between the non-Jews and the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">Let's face it. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">That was not the case in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="975">It was not the case in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , either. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">I want to say here that we never knew exactly how many Jews were in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> because people were not registered as to their race, religion, creed or anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">We figure that there were probably, including all the refugees from the east, in 1938, '39 and even early in 1940, there were probably something like 70,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">Only about 30,000 survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And that was better than <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="980">Where only, I think, only maybe 20 or 15 percent survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">So, the Dutch were not as lucky as we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">They had this SS Golighter(ph) from the very beginning and that was very, very dramatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">Very sad, tragic.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="987">ANSWER:  As far as administration, you could say it was a one man operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">He did have assistants. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">He had people helping him find families. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">He had people taking care of false identification papers and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">But as far as administration, he was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">He had all the power and all the responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">As far as finance is concerned, he was a Benedictine Monk, and all his possessions were on his body. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">That is his cassock and maybe his handkerchief and that was about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">He got support from various families who were not willing to take a child, but were willing to contribute. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">But, of course, the biggest support he got was from the . </span><span class="sentence" id="997">The largest <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> whose director we called governor in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">Was Mr. Gallopan, he was fiercely anti-Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">And he committed himself to contributing a large amount of money each month to Father Bruno. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">It may not have been quite enough to cover all the expenses, but it was an extremely significant help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">Mr. Gallopan guaranteed those payments monthly and the payments were collected by Jack Dupon(ph) who was Father Bruno's brother-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Another uncle of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">And he continued doing that until the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Unfortunately, poor Mr. Gallopan was a victim of Nazi thugs who one day came and rang his doorbell and said, are you Mr. Gallopan? </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And he said, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">And they just killed him on the spot with a blast of submachine gun, right in front of his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">But the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> continued honoring his commitment all the way to the end of the wat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1008">QUESTION:  What about other organizations such as the Jewish Defense Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1009">ANSWER:  Well, there was, of course, the CDJ, which was a committee for the defense of the Jews, the initials are the same in English as in French, . </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">Who was very active and collaborated very closely with Father Bruno. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">The problem with that is, like it was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , some of the leaders of that group were, how shall I say, were persuaded by the Germans to cooperate with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">But, of course, the ultimate idea was not at all cooperation, it was to get all the information they could get. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">And so, Father Bruno was a little bit reluctant to associate directly with the CDJ because he knew there were files and reams of paper that could be found and were found by the Gestapo leading to the arrest of quite a number of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">Fortunately, most of the members of CDJ escaped death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">Several went to various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , but they didn't die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">One of them was Mrs. Jospa(ph) who was one of the closest collaborators of Father Bruno and is still alive now, as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">And there were several others who were both in the armed resistance and in the peaceful resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">Because Father Bruno always said, I'm going to be resistance, but I'm going to be a peaceful resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">I will never bear arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">Which he didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">But some of the actual armed resistance did cooperate with the peaceful resistance for various reasons and there were several of those, one of them was killed in action and another one died, I believe, after the liberation in an unfortunate accident, in the army at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1022">QUESTION:  What sort of coordination would there have been between this committee and your Uncle's network?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1023">ANSWER:  The coordination was on a person to person basis mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">They were, the CDJ had visitors, or visiting people I should say, who visited the children at various <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And they would report to the CDJ, but also to Father Bruno. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">And the CDJ had a committee that was specifically organized to do that, to keep track of the kids that were placed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">But that was precisely one of the dangers that Father Bruno feared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">That there was too much documentation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">And so he tried to cooperate with them as close as he could, but without any written documentation, without papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">He would handle only cash, never checks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">Or just, you know, items, like butter or meat or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">But he would not use things that could be traced, such as checks or various deposit slips and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">He would meet with the representatives of the CDJ in a neutral environment, but there were never any records written of their discussion, except when he was called to the committee of the CDJ as a guest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">Then they kept their records, but he always insisted, he said, don't put my name on your records. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">Not that I'm afraid for me, but if they catch me, my entire network is gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">So, they didn't put his name on the records. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">This actually caused some confusion after the war because he said, I was at that meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">And they would pull the records and say, well, you're name is not on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">And, but that was deliberate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">So, there was a loose cooperation, but there was cooperation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">And in fact, a fairly extensive, but loose, if you see what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">It wasn't, you know, like in an army where the corporal refers to the sergeant, the sergeant refers to the second lieutenant and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">It was a loose cooperation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">They would have meetings that were informal where decisions were made only verbally and that actually added to the security of the network.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1045">QUESTION:  Were there Protestant groups who were also involved in this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1046">ANSWER:  There was some Protestants but, you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> has very few Protestants actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">But there were several Protestant ministers involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">Indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">But to go back to the Catholic clergy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">There was a whole network of priests who worked either directly or indirectly with Father Bruno. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">One of the best known was Father Andre(ph) from Namir(ph) who, you know, at the greatest risk, always had something like 10, 12, 15, up to 25 kids in his own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Namir</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">And here's another one of those extremely bizarre coincidences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">Father Bruno did not have a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where he could, you know, which he could call his base. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">Until a spinster of a certain age allowed him to use a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> she had on the square in the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">Because she wasn't using it and it wasn't being rented. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">It was a very small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">On the left side was a <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> with horse betting, what do you call that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">You know what I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">Anyway, horse betting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">On the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was a of the SS, who was working on the Gestapo Jewish files of New Louise(ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">But that turned out, again, to be a sort of a protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">Because he was right next to this important Nazi officer and they never ever considered the little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in between there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">And the second coincidence, Father Andre in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Namir</span> had, on his left, a <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> with horse betting and on his right a portion of the Commandant , which was not SS, but it was German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">Can you imagine a more bizarre coincidence than that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">Father Andre did an awful lot of work and he deserves all the credit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">I think he is on the list at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">Deserves all the credit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And until the end of the war, he was constantly at risk of being caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">There were many other priests, I won't give you all the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">First of all, I can't remember them right now, one of them was Count , who was an aristocrat of a very old Belgian family who was a pastor of a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">He, too, took care of several kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">He was a friend of my father's actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">And there were quite a number of other clergymen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">And nuns, of course, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">Flora Singer was hidden in a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> of nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">It wasn't always a pleasant life because the nuns themselves don't have a very pleasant life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">Very strict and during the war there wasn't enough food for everybody and they had to, you know, to share what food they had with everybody, including the Jewish girls, usually girls, who were hidden there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">So some of the girls have bad memories of having to wash the dishes and of being cold in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> because the central heating wasn't working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">There was no coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">And at that time, central heating was mostly coal fired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">We didn't have any oil. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">Even if it had been oil fired, they wouldn't have had any oil to put in there anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">So, yeah, the conditions were not always pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">But, what's the alternative?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1085">QUESTION:  When you mention the scarcity of food or coal, how did your uncle and his colleagues get enough food or clothing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1086">ANSWER:  You know, that was one of the most hair raising problems, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">To get enough food and clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">Partly it was contributions from people who had enough food, just enough and maybe a little more than just enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">That was only a small part. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">I think most of the sources were actually legal sources done illegally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">In other words, there was, for example, the wife of the same professor at the University of Louvan(ph) who at night went, would you believe, to burglarize the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of rationing, the rationing department. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">And stole reams of food stamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">Now, you couldn't have just food stamps because you also had to have a card to go with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">That was a precaution the Germans took so that that very thing wouldn't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">So, they had to forge food cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">And in the book that, the new book that we wrote about Father Bruno, there is a sample of one of those food cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">Strangely enough, one of the best forgers was an old monk in Father Bruno's <span class="BUILDING">abbey</span> , , very, very adorable old father who would never have done a thing like that in his life if he hadn't been persuaded by Father Bruno that he was doing humanitarian work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">He said, I can't be a forger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">But, he did and he was probably the best of all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">So, they forged hundreds of food cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">They also had to forge identity cards to go along with food cards because, unlike the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , most <span class="REGION">European countries</span> demand that their citizens bear an identity card on them all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">At least after age 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">So, you know, they had to, we had to forge identity cards with false names, false places of birth and false dates of birth so that nothing could be traced. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">One time Father Bruno was at an open <span class="BUILDING">market</span> , there was an open <span class="BUILDING">flea market</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and he was looking, I think, for old clothes or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">And he had his briefcase with him full of blank identity cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">And, sure enough, as he walked away, there was a check point with two , who were there and were searching peoples suitcases as well as checking the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">And he had a false identity card himself which said that he was an employee of the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">And he managed to persuade those numskulls that he was taking work <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because he needed to finish some cards for the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">And they let him go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Now, you had to be pretty thick to let that happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">But they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">That was one of his close escapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">He had a few more, but that was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">And, so, ration cards, food stamps, stolen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">It was very difficult to produce false food stamps, 1t was almost impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">You had to have the glue, you had to have special colors and so on and so on, so they were stolen, they were not falsified. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Identity cards, on the other hand, were pre-printed and then they filled in the name by hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">So once you had the pre-printed card, it wasn't too difficult to falsify a card as long as you had one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> rubber stamps or one of those embossing stamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">That worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">If you were lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">There was always a problem because, you know, you had to have a signature on that and if somebody was pretty bright, which didn't often happen in the SS, thank goodness, they could have made the person reproduce their signature. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">You know, since many of those were young kids, maybe 14, 15 years old, they could have done a bad job of reproducing their signature and that would have given away the falsification. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">So, identity cards, food cards, ration stamps and mostly, occasionally a, what do you call it, a welfare check. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">But he didn't like that because, again, that could be traced. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">Most of the time the money, as I said, came either from the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> or from private contributions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1126">QUESTION:  Did he have cohorts in <span class="BUILDING">government offices</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1127">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">He had, fortunately, many, many of the Belgian civil service employees were faithful, were reliable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">They were anti-German and he knew which were and which were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">He had a number of helpers, mostly in the municipal governments where it was most important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">Because that's where the stamps and the cards were issued. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">One day he went in this particular <span class="BUILDING">municipal office</span> where he had an appointment with the assistant chief and a lady seemed to be in a hurry and, because he was very courteous, he said, okay, go in first. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">She went in, took her time, and he saw two people just babbling or talking about various papers there and then it was his turn and one of the guys walked away, went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">Picked up his suitcase, his briefcase, and went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And when he got near the assistant chief, he said, you don't know, but I'm sweating here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">That man who just left was from the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">If you had come in at your turn instead of letting the lady go in first, we would have been both caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">So, another close escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">But, this was help he got from the civil service or the employees of the government, various governments.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1141">QUESTION:  Were most of these people who helped him motivated by working with Father Bruno, anti- German, or really motivated to rescue Jewish children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1142">ANSWER:  I think all three. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">I think it varied on the person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">You may even add one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">Money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">Because many rescuers were given money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">And during the war, money was very tight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">And some people would take this terrible risk just to get a little more money to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">But, I would say, all three. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">Idealism, you know, I want to save the Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">Charisma from Father Bruno. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And, you know as you said, all these three possibilities plus, I think, a certain appeal for money at times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1153">QUESTION:  What other aspects of the logistics were very difficult?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1154">ANSWER:  Transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">Not to be caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">Because some kids had to be transported from one end of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">And even though <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> is a small <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , that still represented 200 miles sometimes and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> during the war were extremely slow and rare. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And so, it may have taken a whole day to do 200 miles by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">You know, getting the children registered in a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">municipality</span> with a false ID card. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">It was difficult unless you had cooperation from the local authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">And once or twice, there was a close call because he would have help from one of the employees and then the mayor of that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">municipality</span> would be either scared or maybe even pro-German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">And they would get wind of the thing and immediately the child would have to be moved away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">That was one of the logistical difficulties, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">And then as I say, as I said previously, the stealing food stamps, you didn't just barge in those <span class="BUILDING">municipal offices</span> and pick your choice of stamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">You know, it had to be done extremely carefully at night, sometimes it was done with the complicity of the employee who would leave the <span class="DLF">door</span> open, for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">Not lock the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">And pretend to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">And then a few hours later, somebody else would come in and sneak in and steal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">And even getting the blank identity cards was sometimes difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">Perhaps less difficult than the food cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">Logistics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">Getting clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">Getting a child registered in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because these kids had to continue their education during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">I mean, they couldn't just stay for a year or even two years without any schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">So, to have them accepted in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was not all that hard, but, there were school inspections and the authorities, the occupant authorities would know how many kids had to be there, and where did the extra one come from? </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">So when they suspected there would be an inspection, they would, perhaps either tell the Jewish child to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or another child to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , or another child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">You know, the teacher would say, oh, you've been sneezing three times today, why don't you go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">And the kid would be most happy to do that and the parents say, oh, what's going on here? </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">Well, we think he may have a cold, keep him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for a day or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">So, that would bring the number back to normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">There were a few interesting incidents, too, because of the language problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">Quite a number of these kids were from <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">And even the Belgian Jews sometimes spoke Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And one incident occurred in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the Waloon(ph) part of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , in the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , and the school inspector came who was, unfortunately, paid by the Germans and he checked the children and one of the Jewish kids was there and the inspector spoke to him and he said, do you speak French? </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">And the kid said, yeah, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">Alright do you speak other languages? </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">Oh, yeah, I speak Flemish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">And then the guy, sneaky as he was, said, well, what do you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">Oh, Yiddish. [</span><span class="sentence" id="1190">sharp intake of breath] That was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">He gave it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">But, apparently, as far as I know, the child did not get taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">Because the teacher was fast enough to make him go away immediately before the authorities had the time to go and fill their papers and, you know, send another crew to arrest him and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">Somehow, apparently that incident could have been terrible, you know, passed away without any major trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">But, you never know, little children, even though they've been trained and trained, they will do things that are beyond their control. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">A little girl in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with one of the, what do you call them, the escorts, was talking to a nice gentleman across from her on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">And he said, what's your name? </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">And she said, do you want my real name or the other? </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">And, fortunately, the gentleman, obviously was not sympathetic to the Germans because he didn't say anything, he just kept quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">But, see how, you know, alarms can just pop up like that without any warning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">End of Tape #5 Tape #6

<p><span class="sentence" id="1202">ANSWER:  Like what happens in an emergency, for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">Well, there really wasn't any set system. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">Again, for obvious security reasons, there couldn't be a certain list where in this case, you call this person, in that case, you call that person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">It was strictly a word of mouth affair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">And one person would call the next person who would call the third person who would try to find, please find Father Bruno, he's on his way to such and such <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , as soon as he gets there, tell him there is an emergency. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">And he would get back to the responsible person and see what to do in that particular case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">One of the cases that I mentioned in the book there, was a little girl who, in spite of all the instructions, wrote a letter to her mother, who was still in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">She had not been deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">She wrote a letter, the mother found, oh before I go any further, I have to tell you that the parents usually did not know where their kids were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">Most of the time they were not told. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">Obviously, again, for security reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">For obvious security reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Well anyway, this little girl had written to her mother, the mother was so anxious to see her that she took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , went to Gent(ph) and, for some reason, had the foolish idea of taking two or three leather purses with her because her husband was a leather worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">And she was hoping to sell those to pay for her train trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">She walked into a purse, what do you call those <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> where they sell purses? </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">In French they call them . </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">Anyway, she went in and offered her purses for sale to the man who, I think he even bought them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">The man was one of the representatives of the Flemish pro-German group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">So, the mother went to the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> which was strictly forbidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">And the sisters, in a panic, called two or three persons and the chain got into operation and the little girl was taken away after she did see her mother, I have to say, to a secret other <span class="NPIP">place</span> and the sisters simply had to give up keeping Jewish girls because the mother had told this man why she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">You know, sometimes people's brains don't function too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">But, anyway, that kind of emergency occurred a fair number of times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">One time, again you can read that if you want in the biography, there were three kids who were in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for Jewish children which was completely under German control. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">And Father Bruno wanted those kids to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">And, well to make a long story short, he arranged for them to have diphtheria, quote unquote, and they were immediately transferred to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> because of a call, again through the chain, saying that, well, the Germans were terribly afraid of diphtheria, they had to take those contagious children out of the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and isolate them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">So they did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">And, again the chain worked, when they were so called cured, they never had been sick in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> , Mrs. Ruspa(ph) and a couple of other people took the three children, made a release letter in three copies, gave one to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , mailed one to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , because the Germans had said, now it's time to go get those children, and have the doctor release them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">Well, they mailed one, but in the meantime, before the mail got to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> which would take at least 24 hours, the children were far away and they kept the third release copy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">This was one of the most movie- like episodes because they had to enlist the help of the doctors, of the nurses, of the bacteriologist who falsified the cultures. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">Of the bacteriologist, again, who had to say they were cured. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">Of the person who made the release letter, who said they could be picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">And knew perfectly well they were not going to be picked up because they were already gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">You know, all of these episodes, if one of them failed, that was the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">But, nothing failed, everything worked fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">What other logistical things were we talking about, again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1237">QUESTION:  Well, I'm sort of curious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">This may be a dumb question, but, how did people find Father Bruno and how did he find families to take care of the children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1239">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">Well, how did they find Father Bruno? </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">Occasionally, through the CDJ, but most of the time a simple word of mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">Mrs. Abraham on this <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> would talk to Sarah on the other <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and say, you know, I know this Catholic monk who took my cousin's little daughter and hid her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">You're in danger, they're looking after you there, they're trying to find you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">Why don't you ask him to hide your little daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">And they would do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">Family members. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">Sometimes out of the blue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">He would never know where or how those people would have got his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">Which was a bit distressing because, he said, if some totally unknown person got my name, who else got my name? </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">And, as a matter of fact, there was one time when he was going 1n one of the <span class="DLF">streets</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> to go collect a little boy, I think, and as he was turning the corner, he saw a black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> stopping in front there and he knew that was the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">And they got the boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">He never had the boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">He never had this child, didn't put his hand on the child once. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">But, they got the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">That was very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">That was one of his most sad experiences, even though it wasn't really one of his proteges, he hadn't gotten the child yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">But, someone had babbled and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">Then, we were talking about emotional issues. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">That was a big problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">Many of these children, of course, didn't want to leave their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">Some of them were old enough to understand what was going on and they would try to make do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">The little ones, you know, the three or four or two year old ones, it was a very, very sad, very difficult thing to handle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">Particularly for Father Bruno who had never had any children of his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">And this was one of the reasons why he was known to keep track of his, quote unquote, kids by going to visit them all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">In addition to looking for new <span class="NPIP">places</span> , he kept track of the old <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">And one of the most intimate friends of Father Bruno, a friendship which continued after the war, was the Rotmeal(ph) brothers who are now in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">And they describe when he would come to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> where they were hidden, and one day he would come with his cassock and the next time he would come with green pants, you know, those pants that they wear to play golf, I forget, knickers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">With green knickers and then Bernard would say, why are you wearing that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">Well, I'm not Father Bruno any more, I'm Mr. so and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">He had several identities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">And his last identity was Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">Renau(ph), you know Renau in French means fox. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">And it was kind of play on words, of course, because he out-foxed them all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">And he said, no, Iam Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">Renau, you don't know me as Father Bruno any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">And he would visit them as often as he could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">But, of course, when there are 300 of them, he couldn't see them every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">But, he would keep track precisely for those emotional reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">Because he had a charisma and he inspired confidence to the, at least to the children old enough to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">And they would really get very, very attached to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">And knowing that he was going to come back sort of soothed their anxieties. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">And made them, you know, accept the separation a little bit better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">He made a big point of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1284">QUESTION:  How do you find all of these families who would harbor the children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1285">ANSWER:  Well, again, it's word of mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">And occasionally, as we said before, by the CDJ, the Committee for the Defense of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">Frequently, Father Bruno himself would just go and talk to those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">Like the University professor I mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">He would just go in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and say, I want you to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">And he had this way of talking to people that they couldn't say no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">You know, when I was a little boy and I wasn't being very good, all he had to do 1s say, now, you're going to have to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">And we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">Both my sister and my brother and I, all he had to say is, I want you to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">And we would do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">Even if we had been very bad with our parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1297">QUESTION:  But I mean, isn't there a whole issue of trust? </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">In just approaching people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1299">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">Well, he approached people after, you know, carefully selecting them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">People he knew were trustworthy and people he had known for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">His close friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">Or people who were guaranteed by others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">There was always a risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">There was always a risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">Accepting a Jewish child from a family was a risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">Not for the Germans, where the Germans were concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">But what if that person was a traitor? </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">What if the child was not Jewish and was just being used as a, you know, a trap. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">There was always a risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">But, for some reason, he must have had, he must have been a good judge of character, because the only time he almost got caught was when this dreadful traitor, so called Captain Jackson who was not a Captain Jackson, he was a Belgian by the name of Bziter(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">Convened a so called resistance group and he refused to go because he smelled a rat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">And all the people who went, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">And he didn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">Because he smelled a rat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">So, you know, he had a sixth sense that made him know when people were genuine or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1318">QUESTION:  Was this the time when there were arrests at Mossesar(ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1319">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">That was, these arrests were made in Male(ph) in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">Male(ph) Mechalen(ph) which is city between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">And there were several of his assistants who went there and they got caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">But I don't think they died in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">But, that's neither here nor there, I mean, they could have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">They were trapped by this traitor who was shot after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">He was condemned by a <span class="BUILDING">military court</span> and shot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1328">QUESTION:  Wasn't there some close call at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mossesar</span> , as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1329">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">Well, that was early in the game, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">Early in the game when he was only beginning his network. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">He was still at the <span class="BUILDING">abbey</span> and they came and searched the <span class="BUILDING">abbey</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mossesar</span> from top to bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">He managed to hide a bunch of papers in a <span class="DLF">chimney</span> and, again, those numskulls didn't even think of looking in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">But, he hid them in a secret <span class="DLF">door</span> or trap in the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> and they never found anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">But that's when the superior of the <span class="BUILDING">abbey</span> said, listen, I have 80 monks here and their my responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">I can't have you have your base of work, I approve of what you're doing, but I can't let you have your base here at the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">Because the next time they come, they will find something and we'll all go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bruckenvald(ph</span> ) or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">And, so, that's when he moved out of the <span class="BUILDING">abbey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">But that was still fairly early in the game, that was in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">And he then rented a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luvan(ph</span> ) and that became unsafe, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">And he then rented another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , which he kept for a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">And then came the little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> from that lady between the and the horse betting institution.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1343">QUESTION:  Did he have any time for traditional religious practice?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1344">ANSWER:  Well, he was given dispensation from mandatory celebration of Mass every Sunday by his superiors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">They realized that he couldn't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">But, whenever he had a chance, he would go to my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> he had a tiny little alter which he built himself and he would celebrate Mass for us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">That's one of the very vivid memories I keep of all of us, you know, really tightly packed in that tiny little attic and him just having barely <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> to turn around and speak to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">That I remember very vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">So, he did as much as he could but it's quite obvious that sometimes he had to do without. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">You know, if on Sunday morning he had an emergency, well, that went before celebrating Mass. And he had permission not to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1351">QUESTION:  How did you feel as you learned more about this, probably afterwards, about being involved in this incredible network?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1352">ANSWER:  Afterwards, after the war when I was old enough to really grasp the danger and the risk, I was terrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">I said, my gosh, we did all that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">And then when that time passed, I said, why, I'm very happy we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">I felt very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">I said, well, I didn't do much, but at least I was part of that and I'm so proud of having his name, bearing his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">You know, that's something that is, 1t remains with you all your life because not so many people are given that opportunity to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">And to do it willingly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">That, now I shouldn't be overly proud because I did so little, but when I think of my family, I'm still pretty proud. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">You know, we all took risks, especially the adults, they risked their lives of course, and there were close calls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">We were lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">I guess we were blessed in our efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1363">QUESTION:  What happened at the time of liberation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1364">ANSWER:  I'm not so sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">I don't want to elaborate too much on that because there were some slightly unpleasant moments. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">Most of them were very happy moments. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">Kids finding remainders of their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">There were very sad moments in that happiness because they knew that their parents and grandparents had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">But they were happy to return to a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">Some people didn't even, some kids didn't have a family to go back to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">Some of them were kept in convents where they were and they were in slightly better condition because the rationing was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">And some of them stayed in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">Some of them had requested to be baptized, but that, oh, I want to insist on this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">This is a point that Father Bruno was extraordinarily touchy about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">He absolutely refused to put any pressure on any Jewish child to change his religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">To convert, quote unquote. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">That he was adamant about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">He said we are to save them, but their souls do not belong to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">That was one of his principles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">And, but some of them who were, you know, exposed to the liturgy and to maybe some slightly, you know, warmer person in the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> , wanted to, there were about five or six of them who wanted to be baptized and that was a big point of contention. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">Because he actually did not want to baptize them unless he had the total guarantee that first of all, the parents wanted it if they were still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">Second, that they would have accepted it if they, none of them did, but had previously made that allowance or permission if you want, and that his superiors were in agreement, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">And I think there were about five out of the 320 or something who were baptized and I think, two or maybe three remained in the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">The other two just went back to Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">And he found that fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">He said, first of all, you weren't totally adult, you were not sure what you were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">Now you saw your fellow Jews and you wanted to be more close to them, fine, go back, that's alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">He never, never put any obstacle to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">And he always refused to put pressure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">Now, I won't say that there wasn't an occasional old crotchety nun who thought that being non-Christian was the worst sin in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">And may have put some pressure on some of the kids, that's possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">That is, I'm not denying that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">Neither did Father Bruno. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">But, it was against his will and, actually, there is no record that any of those actually did change, so it was just an annoyance and was a little child abuse, I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">Moral child abuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">Which he certainly didn't approve of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">I digress now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">What were you asking me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1400">QUESTION:  We were talking about the difficulties after liberation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1401">ANSWER:  Right, that's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">It took months and months and, if not to say years, to find the surviving parents, if there were any. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">To find surviving family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">Uncles, cousins, if there were any. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">And to find willing adoptive parents if there were no family members available. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">Some of the kids, even though they still remained Jewish, wanted to stay with the people who had harbored them during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">That became a little difficult because the CDJ, after the war, tried to gather all the kids back into the Jewish fold, which 1s fine, I mean, it was a legitimate concern of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">The only thing where Father Bruno objected seriously is when a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for Jewish kid was built and, supposedly, non-denominational, but it was only Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">And some members of the CDJ wanted some of the kids to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">But Father Bruno said, I don't want that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">I want them to go back to a good Jewish family, that's fine, but I don't want them to go to a sterile, although Jewish, environment where they will not teach them religion, or if they do it will be on an optional basis and where they will not be allowed to practice the Christian religion if they wanted to do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">And that was one of the points of contention. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">Unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">Another point of contention was some of the relatives who wanted to get the children back before any formalities had been completed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">And I have, unfortunately, witnessed a very sad and dramatic incident where some uncles came to my younger uncle's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> the day after liberation and demanded to have one of the kids who was staying there, without permission from anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">Not even the CDJ, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">They just came and took the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">Not knowing if the parents were alive or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">They just wanted the kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">And they didn't even live in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">There were a few unpleasant incidents, but I would say on the whole, the vast majority, the replacement of these children went pretty smoothly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">Thanks to the help of people like Mrs. Jospa(ph), who made a point of continuing Father Bruno's work yet working for the CDJ or the, I forget the new name they get, they got after the war, but anyway, it's the CDJ, it's the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1424">QUESTION:  So, Father Bruno's work didn't end at liberation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1425">ANSWER:  No, it didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">In fact, he continued to work for about two months and then had a bad accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">And had to be hospitalized for a full month. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">And during that time, he was unable to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">Most of his assistants took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">And took over the replacement functions and he kind of loosely supervised after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">Then he was re-drafted in the army because before the war he was an army chaplain, yeah, he was a mobile Benedictine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">He was an army chaplain during the campaign of 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">He was slightly wounded and was taken prisoner of war in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">Then after World War II, after his accident was healed, his superiors said it was okay for him to go back into the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">And he went back into the army for another three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">And he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">And this is where he was able to see with his own eyes numerous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">Particularly Neu , which he photographed extensively. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">And Bergen Belsen and several others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">I forget which ones they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">End of Tape #6 Tape #7
QUESTION:  From my reading, I understand that your uncle was a true intellectual, a scholar, and yet, came time for the war, he had tremendous street smarts, pragmatic skills all of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1442">ANSWER:  Yes, and people have all the qualities, don't they? </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">He was a Benedictine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">And in French we had a saying for people who do enormous amounts of tedious, lengthy work. . </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">The work of a Benedictine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">And in addition to his action work during World War II, he did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">He did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">He did the . </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">He compiled very extensive studies on the works of some of the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic Church</span> 's early fathers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">Like Saint Irinae(ph) who was one of the early writers of the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic Church</span> , in the Fourth Century, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">Incidently, I received a call from a very erudite professor at one of the <span class="BUILDING">Eastern universities</span> a few months ago saying, oh, I read in the bibliography for Saint Irinae that your uncle's work is the basic work for people who research Saint Irinae and I was very proud to hear that his name has appeared in this, I forget the name of the man, but I've got 1s someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">Doctor so and so is doing studies on Saint Irinae himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">And he's basing his studies on Father Bruno's work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">He published one very extensive work in which he, a sort of a dictionary, if you want, in four languages, Latin, Greek, Coptic(ph) and Aramian(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">Because Saint Irinae's writings were in various translations at that time already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">And so that whoever 1s doing studies on Saint Irinae can read them in either language. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">And he published an extensive study on the writings themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">And then he had a continuous series of articles in one of the theological reviews in .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1459">QUESTION:  I'm just curious, this contrast between the man you're describing right now and this man of action who was so successful and so active.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1460">ANSWER:  He was, after the war, he was pastor of a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> for several years and enjoyed that very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">His superior had released him from the <span class="BUILDING">abbey</span> because he could see he just couldn't stay in the <span class="BUILDING">abbey</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">He had done so much work <span class="NPIP">outside</span> that to be <span class="BUILDING">cloistered</span> again would just kill him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">So he sent him as pastor at a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">I went there several times and enjoyed it very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">He became totally enthralled by this pastoral ministry which he hadn't actually done before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">He became totally conquered by that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">The village people loved him a lot, too, and yet, he would close his <span class="DLF">door</span> at a certain time and they knew better than to bother him unless if it's for an emergency. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">And he would work on his intellectual endeavors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">So, he would spend two or three hours a day writing and researching Saint Irinae again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">And so he tried to always balance, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">Of course, during the war he did little intellectual work, but he did some. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">And I still remember my grandmother transcribing some of his chicken scratch onto neat white paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">She has a beautiful, had a beautiful handwriting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">And she transcribed many, many pages of his works. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">So it would be legible for the publisher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">During the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1477">QUESTION:  As an individual, is religion important to you today?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1478">ANSWER:  To me? </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">Well, we have remained practicing Catholics and our children are, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">I perhaps don't have the as we Say in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , the sacred fire, as much as Father Bruno had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">We try to remain, let's say reasonably close. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">We go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> every Sunday and one of our very best friends is a Dutch priest who speaks, you know, a Dutch priest who is a, who speaks several languages and we became very friendly with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">And he's one of the totally adorable people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">A little bit like Father Bruno. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">He has been teaching theology, languages and so on, and yet, he did all the garden work for the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> at <span class="BUILDING">St. Thomas seminary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">Again, a man of both action and cerebral work, if you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">So, yeah, we're, I would say it's important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">I won't claim and be dishonest and say that we are thinking about it every minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">But, it is still important for us, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1490">QUESTION:  Are there certain lessons that you gained from that religious practice or observance that impact the way you live, still.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1491">ANSWER:  I should say so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">I should say the concern for other people, the concern for , aS We Say in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">Our neighbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">You know, the things that our grandmother taught us to be concerned about other people, to be practically practicing our religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">Not just kneeling on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pew</span> and babbling prayers that don't mean anything to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">I probably don't remember the vast majority of prayers I learned by heart when I was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">But, I don't think that's so important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">It's much more important to be nice to your neighbor, to do things to help, to be concerned about your neighbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">I would like, 1f you don't mind, I would like to give you something that Father Bruno said when he was asked, why did you do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">He said, the motives was a revolt against injustice and violence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">A consciousness of our common past. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">Both historical and theological. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">He was very conscious of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">Personal fondness for encounters, quote, at the frontiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">Because in the '40's it was still considered the frontiers, you know, Catholic priests didn't mingle so much with Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">He loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">Secondly, the goals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">To save human lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">To reconstitute or preserve families. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">To establish human contacts between Judaism and Christianity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">And the spirit is a spirit of respect of human life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">Respect of human dignity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">Expansion of mutual respect by reciprocal knowledge of values, culture and spiritual climate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">That was his answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">He did not give very many interviews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">Certainly not a four hour one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">But this is one that he expected to give, to a Jewish publication. </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">And I thought it resumed or it abstracted well what his ideas were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1519">QUESTION:  Through yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">These early experiences for you, when you grew up very fast, how do you think they influenced you later in life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1521">ANSWER:  I would say that it was a little bit on the back burner for maybe, oh, 20 years after the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">Mostly because I didn't have time to do anything but study. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">I was in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and then in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and then in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">I graduated in 1959. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">We came here in a new environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">In 1961. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">I didn't have any books with me because I didn't know I was going to stay so long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">I read and spoke English, but I didn't know much about the <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> here, so I didn't have anything to go to to get more information. </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">Gradually, on the other hand, after I talked to my uncle a number of times, and I saw him again on my rare trips to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , I, suddenly it came back and I said, I've got to do something about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">And I became a fanatical history buff only about World War II and particularly the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">And I became so interested that I felt almost as Jewish as my Jewish friends at times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">We had a reunion in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington D.C.</span> about two years ago where a good dozen of rescued people met with me and we gave a series of lectures through the ADL and so on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">And at the end, when they asked me to say something about them, I said, I think I've got 12 new Jewish cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">And, yeah, it did change my mind on a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">I realized how close we could be and, you know, which I probably wouldn't have known as well if I hadn't gone into that intensive study of the events. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">And then after I studied the Holocaust in general, then I dug into Father Bruno's records which were not all that abundant because he destroyed much of them after World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">But I was able to collect a good number of things and, of course, there were things I knew of personal knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">I got information from my other uncles and aunts who had letters and had memories or, you know, in their minds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">And helped me and we all worked together on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">And when he finally died, we decided we had to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">And then this nice young man, Mr. Johannes(ph) Bloom(ph), who was much to young to have known Father Bruno, was an Austrian Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">Came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> and heard about him and said, we've got to do something to try to remember this person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">And then he got in touch with me, we wrote the biography, we got testimonies from a number of rescued people, many of whom are still alive in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">One of his most favorite guys is still in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> there and his name is Svee(ph) Harlioff(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">And he was one of the most vocal and before, actually, we started working on that, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> invited Father Bruno, as a guest, in 1964, in August, 1964, he was made Righteous of the Nations at the Advashem(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">And has a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> there in his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">And he met a number of the kids who were no longer kids at that time, had children of their own, that he had rescued. </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">And for him, of course, it was a most emotional moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">This is a picture of him that was taken in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and it's been the picture that everybody has shown of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">It's a very good picture because it shows the twinkle in his eye and the half smile which was so typical of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">And he enjoyed his stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">Then my second uncle, my younger uncle, the dentist, Jean(ph) , has recently also been made Righteous of the Nations and so he appreciated that very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">He's 82 years old now, still alive and doing well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">So he was also honored by <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for, actually, there were times when he had 25 kids in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and think of the risk.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1557">QUESTION:  Your family also saved some adults.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1558">ANSWER:  Yeah, but not a great number. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">And those were most of the time, done by Father Bruno himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">Except for three that were in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , in my own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a Polish girl, a young Polish girl, an older woman from <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> ...

ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">And a third woman, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">That's right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1563">QUESTION:  But there were also adults who were saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1564">ANSWER:  Yeah, they came in succession. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">That was at the very end of the war, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">I would say the second, well, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">The first nine months of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">And then, of course, the liberation took place and, in September, so, our last one ran out the <span class="DLF">door</span> screaming happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1570">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you'd like to add? </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">I appreciate your...
ANSWER:  Well, I must say it's a great honor for me to be interviewed by the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">I've visited the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> and it was an extremely emotional experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">My wife, who was with me, had the same experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">It was, I don't know what the word is, but it was quite an experience to see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">Things that I, for the most part, had at least some idea of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">Many things I knew rather well, but to actually see all of that in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> and be totally surrounded by that, ooh, 1t was quite an experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">I think that's one of the most emotional experiences I've ever had in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">It was really something I will not forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">And I want to thank you for coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> and you people who are filming and listening, I appreciate your cooperation and coping with my old <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with very little power.</span></p>
