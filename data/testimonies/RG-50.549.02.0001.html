ANSWER: None
ANSWER:  My brother's name is Alfred Kurz and we call him Freddy and I will probably be calling him that in the course of this interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">And he lives in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  So later on we're very interested in your relationship with your brother and in general your relationship with your brother seems to have been the factor that still exists in your life, that brought you through that experience, so if we start at, arriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> after the war, just in general, the climate of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and the environment there, in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> , how could you describe it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Let's see, I can't answer that specifically. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I'm going to drop back from that a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">At the end of the war, we were liberated from a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that took us out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen</span> and the aim of the Nazis was to destroy the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , but we were liberated before that could happen, by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And that happened in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which later on was in <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">It was in the spring, in April and eventually, it took three months for the Red Cross to bring us back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , along with the other survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">My mother was still alive and in the course of our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride, she got typhus, which I had had before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And she was not well, even before the typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">She survived the crisis of the typhus in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> and when she was up and about again, the Red Cross made contact with us and brought us through Lypeseig(ph), which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> still exists, back eventually into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Now, a couple of recollections of that time stick out very sharply. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">In Lypeseig(ph) my, there was a, we stayed in an armory of some sort, or a compound that had an armory and outside of that armory, there was a machine, like a clothes wringer in appearance, except there were knives in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">You turned some wheel, some lever and there were knives <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And Freddy, my brother, who always had had investigative leanings, stuck his finger in there and turned the, turned the lever and cut off the tops of his fingers. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I remember that because it was a lot of blood and a lot of hoopla and my mother very upset and very aggravated and they got him bandaged up and he has little bumps on three of his fingers, to the, at the top of his finger cause he cut off the top of his fingers, so certainly do remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I remember waiting along the way somewhere, in , with lots of other people, waiting for truck transport to move us from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I had found in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we were liberated, a doll somebody had left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And for that doll, which was really my first toy in a very long time and I was nine, I made little clothing out of little pieces of material and I made a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cradle</span> out of shoe box type of things and I was very attached to that little doll. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I put it down somewhere in the midst of that great mass of people waiting to be transported and somebody took it and I cried and cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">It was a great blow. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Eventually we got back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , into a large <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , I don't know where it was, but you know, it's a child's recollection and I remember being in that large <span class="NPIP">place</span> like, sort of like the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> we'd had in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , but large and lying down and taking a nap and when I woke up, at the foot of my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , was my oldest girlfriend, Nomi(ph) Moskovitz(ph), with whom I grown up and whom I had not seen during the intervening years. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And she also, with her family, was in that <span class="BUILDING">displaces persons facility</span> and my mother had found her. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">So, a couple of those things that really stand up very sharply. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Eventually we were out of those <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and into our old <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  I just wanted to ask before we went...
ANSWER:  I can tell you what, what happened with Nomi(ph), I mean that's fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I didn't, I saw Nomi(ph) for a few times in the following year. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">She and her family also moved back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">She had two brothers, one brother and at the time before the war and after the war she had some more siblings, her parents had some more children and it was quite remarkable because her father was sent to a separate <span class="NPIP">place</span> , separate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> from Nomi(ph) and her mother and miraculously that family survived and was reunited after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I will come back, I will tell you more about Nomi(ph) in a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">She remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , eventually she was married and she moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and the last time I saw Nomi(ph) was in March of 1946 and then did not see her again until 1959, which was my first trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and I had that trip, on that trip I started out going to Europe first and went through <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and saw her parents and they gave me her address in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and I am a blonde and blue eyed and Nomi(ph) has a dark complexion, very dark eyes and black hair and we have, we were friends from the time we were in <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> , four and I always felt, I guess because it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and I was blonde and blue eyed, that I was ordinary and looked like everyone else and that she was beautiful because she was so different looking, so dark and she had long black hair and I was envious of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">In 1959 when I had not seen her for 13 years and in that time we had both gone from being girls to being women. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">She had been married, I was not and I visited her in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , there, I got such a shock because there was this big, fat woman, very large and it was Nomi(ph) and we were unable to communicate on any level, almost entirely, there was some inanities just that went, were between us and totally, you know, but we had been sort of like sisters, we slept in each others <span class="BUILDING">house</span> __, it was exactly like two people from other <span class="NPIP">planets</span> and I have not been in touch with her since, so that's about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I will, I will go back now to my time in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So eventually, and I don't know how my mother accomplished that, we got back our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">At the time we were arrested in the middle of the night and we moved, the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was taken from us and our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> was done away with and I suppose there must have been some resettlement commission and my mother got back our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and we went back into it, but she, my mother was really quite sick at that time already and we lived in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> a very short time and my mother was hospitalized and...
QUESTION:  None of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> was there, none of the same?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  None of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> was there, no, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> my parents had had was made in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , custom made to order for my parents by a well known architect and none of that was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But, my, there was some simple <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> that my mother had. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We were not there very long before it was impossible for my mother to continue as she was and she was moved to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was still ours and she underwent some surgery and Freddy and I went to live with friends of my parents, I will allude briefly, I mentioned those people when I made the visual tape because those were the people who were in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> the night the Gestapo came. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Those were, that was the family that my mother was hiding and they had resettled after the war, they were all hidden, the members of that family whose name was Roos, R-o-o- s. They had been in, separately under hadoken(ph) and they were reassembled after the war and they were living in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rainin(ph</span> ) in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , about an hour and a half outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and they lived in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on a <span class="DLF">dike</span> , it was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">farming town</span> and Freddy and I went to live with them while my mother was not well. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Eventually my mother was brought back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and she did linger until March of 1946, when she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So for those nine months that she was ill, we were most of time living with the family Roos in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rainin(ph</span> ) on the <span class="DLF">dike</span> and I therefore am not really, I, there's not a whole lot I can say about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and what happened to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">The only times we were brought in was to visit my mother and that not very often, once every couple of months, she...
QUESTION:  She was far away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  She was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and... [ringing phone]
QUESTION:  So, we've been interrupted, but we have been discussing how you and your brother coped together with the loss of your mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  That, that answer is really on so many different levels. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I would tell you from today's point of view, looking back as an adult person, that I'm not, I think I'm pretty mentally stable, fairly so, | mean no worse than most people, but I attribute that in very large part to the, to two facts. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">The most important is that I have a brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I think I would not really have managed without, because he was my root. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">In general I, I think today that children can survive almost anything as long as they are confident in the care and love of a parent. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And although, I mean obviously my history, my childhood was not a very good childhood, looked at it from that point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Still, if I compare myself to the children I read about in the paper who suffer abuse at the hands of their parents, I had a rosy childhood in comparison. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Because even looking back from here, surely there were moments of fear and lots of horrible things that I, I looked at, but I never doubted my survival and I always felt secure when my mommy was there and I was fortunate in that, that mother was not an hysterical sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">She made it, 1t seem okay and I came through the war never doubting that we'd come through, in fact I remember lots of talk about, you know, with my mother about after the war, when my father, whom we called Poppy, would be back and we never doubted that. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And after the war, directly after the war, while my mother was still alive, we talked a great deal about when she would get better and in that year it certainly began to dawn on me that she was not getting better, but it was in conceivable because that was grounded in my security. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Now we were very lucky because we knew, Freddy and I, from a very early age on, that we had lots of family elsewhere, in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and my mother drilled us consistently in addresses, in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , where her brother lived and in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , where my father's family was and so I guess she figured if she wasn't going to make it through, she wanted us to have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that we would go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">It was a very close family and directly after the war, of course contact was made with them again and in fact, one of my father's brothers came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> not long after the war and he got, he got a passport, he got a visa and he was able to come and to arrange for my mother's care and also to start to arrange for our coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and so by the time I was told that my mother had not long to live and by the time I, we internalized that, we knew that we were not going to be in an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , for example, we knew that we were going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and so we were looking forward to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So the fact that we survived emotionally, fairly, fairly emotionally stable, both of us, certainly is due to the type of person my mother was, the fact that we had a loving relationship and the fact that we were confident in that close family that we had overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Now, for me, I think the importance of my brother really happens after that, it's after we come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Once, once my mother died and my own roots were gone, in that sense, you know my, my parents were gone and, and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was gone, even though I was here with loving aunt and uncle, still, it and, and a loving aunt and uncle who had been very close to my parents so, my parents were talked about, it wasn't like, you know, I was with strange people who had no idea about my background, but still it was the fact that I had a brother that gave me a feeling of belonging. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">With my own history, belonging to something that had started when I started, when I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And that has increased 1n importance, or that did increase in importance to me, in the years that we were growing up in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I say that despite the fact that we entered a wonderful <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and you know, that we were cared for and loved, but, but children don't give up what's theirs easily and my background was mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And my brother was the only one who had really shared it and who, you know, we'd had the same experiences, we had seen the same things, the bad stuff and we were very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Now, besides that, I was the older of the two of us by 16 months and my mother would always, you know, blame me when we had fights, cause I was the older one, I should know better and she had always made me be responsible when, when we were, for some reason, you know, it was up to me, so when she died, I felt definitely a responsibility for him and for us as a brother-sister team and for values such as religious observance, that we had learned there, I mean I jealously guarded those parts of our background that I thought were important for us and that would have been important for my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And I spun them into a little private thing between us. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And because we were very close in age, we really were close personally as well, we related well. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">To this day there's certainly no one in the world with whom I fight as much as I do with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We, we can barely be in each other's company for 10 minutes without one of us screaming at the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We certainly don't have the same points of view and we see life differently and he's a man, I'm a woman, so that already is different and, but underlying it, there is a very deep love and respect that goes both ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">For my 60th birthday my brother gave me a surprise party 1n a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and he made a speech, I, he never, he never says anything nice, he never gives a compliment to anyone's face, he'll never say you look nice, or that's great, what you did, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But that man got up there and made a speech about me which was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">He's a kind, he's a more closed person than I am and that was one of the few times in his life ever, that the <span class="DLF">window</span> was opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And I didn't, I never needed those words, you know, to kind of let me know that it is a two way street because he's done much more me in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">We've tried to do for each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">But he's always been there for me and I know and I've said it many times, that if God forbid I had lost him, I, I wouldn't have made it, I am sure of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  Thinking of you and your brother and going back to the time between your mother died, when you actually got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and then the trip over to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , you mentioned your being vehement about your little secrets and religious observances, was your faith, were you able to practice it together with the community during that time, or was it important at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  I'm sorry, I don't know which time you mean now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  The time from, between your mother's passing and your getting to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , that transition of time before you were with your family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  See again, this is not an easy answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">My mother was a very observant women in terms of the practice of Judaism, but she was never dogmatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And she was very clever about the way she, she tried to instill that into Freddy and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I never remember her saying you cannot do this on, on, on Shabbas(ph) or you can't eat this and that together, I never remember her saying that, but I read from a very early age and one day, for example, I found, I loved books, and I found a book lying around, I looked at 1t and there were pictures in it and, and I tried to read it but some of the words were too big and I asked about it and she said, "Oh, well, if you want me to, I'll read you story." </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And you know, that was a book of bible stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Well she did everything in that way, she tried to make things likable and fun, so whatever practice we did, it was never onerous in any way, it was always in a good context, so I can't even tell you that I knew about the laws of Kashrut or the laws of, of Saturday as such, I don't know that I could have verbalized them, but I knew what we did and didn't do with my mother and tried to continue to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Well, we grew up in, after the war, first in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of those people in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rainin(ph</span> ) and they were also observant to a degree, but I know there was no kosher food to be had, or kosher meat to be had in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> at that time, especially where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I cannot imagine that the food that we ate after the war was, was kosher, but I don't remember being in agony or anything of the sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So I know there was no meat served at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with butter or milk, for example, but I don't remember ever questioning like where did, there wasn't that much meat, but I don't remember questioning where the meat came from, we were just happy to have any sort of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And so the people with whom we stayed certainly were not against observing because they had come from an observant background as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , my aunt and uncle, my uncle was my father's brother and my aunt, the lady who we grew up with, Lillian, she came from a very observant <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , probably more so than the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that my parents had grown up in and so there was no problem about observance. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">In the interim, between the time we left <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and the time we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , well, okay, I'll talk about that for a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I already mentioned that one of my father's brothers came over to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and that was my Uncle Charlie and my father's, my father and his brother had world wide optical business before the war and we had an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and so he came over both to take, look after my mother and Freddy and me and also I think, to see what was left from a business point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And he spent many, several months actually, in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">He was there when my mother died. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And he came to visit us, also stay with us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rainin(ph</span> ), in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we were, just a quick little aside there, I mean, this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was not up to the minute in technology and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we had really, literally was on a <span class="DLF">dike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">A <span class="DLF">dike</span> , a <span class="DLF">dike</span> 1s really a <span class="DLF">road</span> , it's like the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> ran below and then on the, as you know <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> is very flat, so from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> to the <span class="REGION">land</span> next to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> is just a flat continuation and then a <span class="DLF">dike</span> was built up high, like a <span class="DLF">wall</span> and at the top of the <span class="DLF">wall</span> they paved it and that was a <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And then on the other side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> there were <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , so that's where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And, but there was no central heating for example and there was a big pot-bellied <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , one of those black things and we fed it coal and wood and it heated up the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , but the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> , which were up on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> , didn't have any heat and anyone who's ever been in the low countries or in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the wintertime, you know that things are very cold there, but this is what we were used to and it certainly didn't bother us, but when my Uncle Charlie came to stay with us, see, that was in the middle of the winter and he, there was, it was a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the family Roos had two boys and there was Freddy and me and so there were only a certain number of <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> and so my Uncle Charlie shared our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , in a big large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and I remember trying to sleep all night and couldn't because my poor Uncle Charlie was just trying to hold onto us for warmth, he was literally all night, you could hear his teeth rattling and he was physically shaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And so, anyway, but he was there when my mother died and then it was very hard to get, get visas to move people, including children from <span class="REGION">western Europe</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , because everybody was trying to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And my uncle with whom I was going to live when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , my Uncle Benjamin, who was another brother of my father, in order to get Freddy and me to have a visa to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to see President Truman and he got for us a special permit, read into the Congress of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , to give us priority to come in, which is how we managed to get in by the following August, August of '46 and while my Uncle Benjamin was trying for that and my Uncle Charlie was in Europe, it was arranged that after my mother died, that Freddy and I, in order to get a visa, should be, should go to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> to establish residency there and from there, once we had our visa, to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and eventually that is what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We left, we left...
QUESTION:  Why <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  I think the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> was open in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , but the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> was not yet open in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and maybe because <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> was a neutral country, I, I, I don't know the politics of the thing, but apparently something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">It was possible to get the visa from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and we got a priority because we were orphaned and because my Uncle Benjamin never took no for an answer on anything and just went straight to the head man. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">He got to the <span class="BUILDING">outer office</span> of President Truman and got to his aide and arranged for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So my mother died in March and March of '46 and Freddy and I were brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> for the funeral and after the funeral they took me to see Nomi(ph), to say good-bye to her because we knew we were going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and then shortly thereafter we flew to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and we were taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> by our Uncle Roos, the man whom we had been living with, he was not really an uncle, he was just friends, but we called him, his name was Abraham, Ab(ph) Roos, so he flew with us to, to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , where my Uncle Charlie was and so we hooked up with my Uncle Charlie there. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">That plane trip, going to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , I remember very vividly because I...
QUESTION:  Your first?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  It was my first plane trip, but I was, I had a terrible case of car sickness as a child, I, I couldn't even get into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> without throwing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And this was a fairly small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , not a very nice day and, and, and it put me off flying for decades. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">That was a three hour trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">All I remember is that that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> kept going up and falling down, going up and falling down. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Must have hit, you know, it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">prop plane</span> , it flew under the clouds, it hit all those air pockets and went down and even though we had not seen an orange in our recollection, Freddy and I, they gave out oranges on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , I filled up every little bag, just threw up that entire trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Sat next to the man who was taking us, you know, Mr. Roos and Freddy was sitting in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jump seat</span> and at some point they found Freddy trying to open up the <span class="DLF">door</span> next to him, I remember that and they rushed, they rushed him away from that little, 1t was like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">parachute seat</span> they had him sitting in and he was fooling around with the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> at the end of the day, stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> which we called the conteenantalb(ph), this is <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Continental</span> , across from the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , we got there late at night and my Uncle Charlie was there and we, we, we both remember this first meal that we had there because <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was still pretty bare after the war, you certainly couldn't get a whole lot of exotic food products and for us exotic was pretty well everything, like oranges, you know, were very exotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And so eggs were hard to come by and so on, so we got in there pretty late at night, I guess about 10 o'clock we, we were taken into the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> to have a meal because we hadn't eaten very much and so Freddy immediately ordered to eggs and so we ate supper and then went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , where Freddy threw up all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I mean, they'd said it was because he ate too much rich food after not having had rich food for a long time, but I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Anyway he was sick all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Two men, my Uncle Charlie and Ab(ph) Roos, trying to comfort a little boy who was throwing up all night and I'm sure they were wishing that there was some woman with them who knew what to do better. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We lived with a family who's last name escapes me for a couple of weeks and then my uncle, my, Ab(ph) Roos went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and my Uncle Charlie arranged for Freddy and me to be moved to a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> for the summer because he had to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , my Uncle Charlie and somebody had to look after us, so they put us into some <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> and we spent the summer there. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">The caretaker, of course all the boys were gone from that <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> , the caretaking family was paid to look after us and by some stroke of fortune, they spoke German and of course my, I had, I mean my parents spoke German, that was there native language so that was my first language and Dutch was my second language. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And so they had a daughter my age, so that summer was spent, her name was Marisha(ph), Mousey and so that summer was spent in, in the company of that little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Oh, lots of things about that summer, first of all my Uncle Charlie...
QUESTION:  Let's go to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> while we go, can you...
ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Can you hold that thought a moment? </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Okay, we're moving to side two. [</span><span class="sentence" id="124">end of side one, tape 1]
ANSWER:  I was speaking about the things in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Most noteworthy was, still while both men were with us, my Uncle Charlie and Ab(ph) Roos, they, we all went walking, I, I just remember <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> and <span class="DLF">bridges</span> in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> and sunshine and most of all what I remember, I, what I, I guess I consider today to be <span class="BUILDING">supermarket</span> , there was <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> that just had racks and racks of food, fruit and food, which just boggled our minds. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And I must say that even today when I think about tt, I'm amazed at that, that in, in Europe after the war, there were <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> that were bare of all those things and <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> that just, just had it up the kazoo. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I mean, we just hadn't seen fruit for, all over, the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , by, by the late spring and summer of 1946 in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , perhaps they'd always had it, I don't know, but they were just full of it and we, we couldn't imagine that. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">It was an upbeat time for us, even though we spoke a lot about my mother and the fact that she'd died and that made us sad, but we were, Freddy and I, looking forward a lot to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And so then they moved us to that <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Somewhere in the course of that summer I got my first taste of bubble gum, tried to learn how to blow bubbles. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">It must have been a pretty austere <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> because the shock was the first morning when we got up, we went to breakfast and they served us, what seemed to me to be sour milk and what I now know to be rye crisps and I couldn't eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">By the end of the summer I liked it quite a lot, but it's, I, I've, I've talked to people since and that was a fairly standard Swedish breakfast, which is yogurt and rye crisp but I considered it sour milk and crackers, I thought it was awful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  Your friend, who you were mentioning, who you spent the whole summer with, is this beyond the <span class="BUILDING">boarding</span> , before the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> , or?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  That was in the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> , her family were caretakers there. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Maybe while all the teachers and the children were gone, they were caretakers and we spent a lot of time playing make believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">My Uncle Charlie had taken us on a shopping binge and I had noticed in a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , nightgowns, long nightgowns and you know I was 10 years old and they were long nightgowns with pretty little puffy sleeves and I made him buy me a pink and a blue and they became princess gowns, I wore one and Mousey wore the other and we made Freddy be the prince. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Spent a lot of time running through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , make believe like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Anyway, in the course of that summer, our visa came through and the, Mousey's mother, the lady who spoke German and with whom we were able to communicate to, brought us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurtaberg(ph</span> ), from where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> we were to sail on, sailed. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was the Grippsholm(ph), Grippsholm(ph) and so Freddy and I set sail. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">It was a two week trip from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I don't know why is should have taken that long. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">We were put into separate <span class="INT_SPACE">state rooms</span> , I shared mine with three women, two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">upper bunks</span> , two lower <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> and Freddy shared his with three men on a different <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And that made me very anxious. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">The lady who took us to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> had arranged for a single maiden lady to eat her meals with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Somewhere around the third day out there was a drill, you know, in case something happened to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , but everybody forgot to tell me it was a drill and so in the middle of the sirens and the whistles blowing, we were told to get on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> and, and we were assigned to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lifeboats</span> and to my horror, we were assigned to different <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lifeboats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And I wouldn't let go of him, I was just screaming and crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Nobody told me that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> wasn't going down. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">It was only afterwards that I learned that. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I, L..
QUESTION:  Did they end up letting you be together? </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Stay together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Somewhere I found out it wasn't for real, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">But I just remember screaming and crying a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I contracted a skin condition which I, _, we knew if was called impetigo, it's very painful and extremely contagious and the fear was that I would not be allowed into <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , because they, they weren't allowing anything contagious in. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Penicillin had come on the scene not long before and the ship's doctor decided to give me a regimen of penicillin every three hours, morning and night, so four times a day and four times at night, they would come to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and give me shot in my rear end. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">It didn't help. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">By the time we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I was still full of impetigo and eventually, unfortunately gave it to the whole family in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , including the two year old child, but in order to hide the condition, I was put into gloves. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I mean the lady who was eating meals with us and who looked after to make sure that we didn't fall off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> I guess, took care to put me into a pair of gloves and when we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I guess that we, this was now August fifth, 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We were still among the first wave of orphaned children that were allowed in after the war and I guess the, the newspapers got lists of celebrities that were expected on these various <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> and then would go to meet the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and try to get a story and so at some point that, first of all, the morning of our arrival, lots of hoopla, everybody was saying, oh, you've got to look, there is <span class="REGION">Long Island</span> , so some people were saying they were going to live on that long island, cause you could see the land mass sticking out and Freddy and I, we said, no, no, we, we're not going to live on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Long Island</span> , we're living at <span class="DLF">503 Fifth Avenue</span> , which was the address my mother had hammered into our heads, cause that was where the <span class="BUILDING">optical office</span> was, <span class="BUILDING">Kurz Optical</span> was there, so we told everybody we were going to be living at <span class="DLF">503 Fifth Avenue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Some man came up, who turned out to be a reporter and who wanted to take our pictures, so he cast about for an interesting shot and found the lifeboy, the round lifeboy that says Grippesholm(ph) on it and posed Freddy and me with our faces through it and took pictures which later appeared in the New York Times and which I have copies. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And me wearing one glove on the impetigo hand, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">My hair, which was still very short because of the lice and all, it hadn't grown back completely yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I was very small, I, you know, the difference in heights, Freddy and me and what we were and where we got to be shortly afterward is quite dramatic as we, we grew a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">When my Uncle Benjamin was allowed on board, which was pretty early on because we were alone, two children alone, traveling, he found us perched on top of the <span class="DLF">railing</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I mean that reporter has, had sat us the top of the <span class="DLF">railing</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , without any regard for our safety and Uncle Benjamin came up, gave that man a real piece of his mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So lots of hoopla, we had a suitcase, we came down off the gangplank, through that big <span class="DLF">pier</span> , where my, two of my aunts were waiting for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  This was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  No, it was no more <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> , straight into the <span class="DLF">docks</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  It would have been then, <span class="DLF">Battery Park</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  No, I think it was not, I think it was in the 20's or the teens, it was on one of the lower slips, one of the lower berths. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And my father's sister, my Aunt Lola was there to meet us and as well as Charlie's wife Karola(ph), the three had come to meet us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and vividly I remember that as soon as I left that large <span class="DLF">pier</span> , that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , my first step to the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , I bumped into somebody who cursed me out very roundly. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I must have stepped on her toe or something, but. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And so then we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> to Brighton(ph) Beach, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , where my Uncle Benjamin and my Aunt Lillian, whom we call Aunt Leah, where they lived, in Brighton(ph) Beach, they lived in a two room <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">They had two children, Diana, who's my age and Vivian who was two. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And Diana was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , this was August the fifth, she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for the summer and Vivian was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , she was a little girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  Were these people who you had not yet met, except for your Uncle Benjamin?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  I had not met my Uncle Benjamin, that 1s to say, now within my recollection, actually they had met me, but I was very small, then by the time they went to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I was, last time I saw them I was two and a half or something, so they knew me, but I didn't know them. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So this was, my Uncle Benjamin had not been to Europe, it was my Uncle Charlie who came to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">My Uncle Benjamin and my Aunt Leah, whom I lived with, who I was to live with, I had not met them. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">So this was my first meeting with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  So your connection with your brother, as you've mentioned many times before, at this point was crucial to your feeling at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  Very much so, very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And then you know how it is when you, when you enter a new family, there are, if children are especially children who are the same age and Diana and I are three months apart, there are lots of adjustments and accommodations that children have to make and there are, there is lots of power play that goes on and where before Diana was queen in her own <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> , except for a two year old sister and you know, there were eight years between her and her sister, she came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to find two siblings of the same age and it was a very rough adjustment and there was a lot of politicking among the three of us as alliances got pushed and pulled. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And so certainly my, my feeling of needing my brother were, or using him in alliances certainly, that was intensified.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  And the language?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  Well, yes, that, lots of things to be said about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">To our great good fortune, my Aunt Leah had spent some years of her young womanhood in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , so she spoke Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I spoke German pretty fluently and indeed still do, it's a children's German. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">If you want to engage me in a conversation about genetics, I won't do so well, but if you want to talk about the ordinary, every day things, I'm pretty fluent. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">You know, what children tend to talk about I can do pretty well and so I didn't have a problem communicating because both Benjamin and Leah spoke German, Leah spoke Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And I want to tell you that a child left to his or her own devices picks up a language very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I arrived here on August the fifth, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at the beginning of September and by that time I spoke English. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And it's true, I mean, they got a lady to come in and teach us something, but that didn't do a whole lot, the truth is...
QUESTION:  Did you also study in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">The truth is, a child that goes, it's one of the reasons I feel so very strongly against what is happening in the school system to allow children to stay in their native language. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">A child left to his own devices picks up a language, a young child, very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">English was my third language. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I had started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in Brighton(ph) Beach, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , at <span class="BUILDING">PS 225</span> , with Mrs. Field, in class 5A. I will say that in the course of that first term, I, I got to speak English fluently. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I didn't get to write it perfectly well, in fact I have compositions from that first half year and the English 1s funny, cause I write what I hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">All of a sudden I wrote as A-I-f-e-r-s-u-d-d-e-n, all of a sudden. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And lots of my compositions which were kept from that time are funny because you can see that I spoke it all right, I just didn't know what I was saying and so I wrote it. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">By the way, Dutch 1s a very exact language, you write exactly what you hear, so I tried doing that in English and of course that, it's amusing to read now. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">But anyway by the time it became apparent it was impossible in two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> for six people to live, we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kew Gardens</span> and into a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and then the second half of my fifth grade I had in, I started <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kew Gardens</span> in a new <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  So you came and you started in what grade?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  In 5A. I was just going to say something about that, I, before we were deported to, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , I had only had the first grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I think I had a couple of weeks of the second grade and then after the war, after we came back in Rainin(ph), I, they, they kind of, I mean lots of children had, had not had proper schooling and I kind of had the third grade, sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And then we left that in the middle, see and then we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> I didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> of course and then, it was only over the summer, was only a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And then I came here and they tested me and I went into the fifth grade, which was the proper grade for a 10 year old to go into. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And of course, education in Europe is a little different. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">In first grade we had learned addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and so by the time after the war, when I was trying to play catch up in the third grade, other children also did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">When I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , children in the fifth grade were about to learn long division, which I knew how to do, so they put me into the fifth grade and the truth is I learned English very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I mean the part of the curriculum that I was backwards on was history because in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> they only learn history of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in the early grades and I knew nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Geography of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , course I didn't know anything about that and literature because I had not read children's books, but I was a voracious reader and loved reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So, what I'm, what I'm ending up with here, so when we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kew Gardens</span> and we were registered in <span class="BUILDING">PS 99</span> , I vividly remember that first morning after the, my Aunt Leah took us in and registered us and the principal called for some young girl who brought us to our <span class="BUILDING">classrooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I was brought into my 5B classroom feeling very self- conscious, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was more formal in those days, everybody was sitting at their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> with their hands clasped and the little girl brought me in to the class and my teacher turned to the class and said, "Now this 1s a little orphan girl from Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">She doesn't speak any English and I want you all to be very nice to her." </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And of course I spoke English quite as well as anyone else, possibly with a little bit of an accent, but I had a dilemma because [| didn't know whether to make her into a liar or whether I should just keep my mouth shut and not let her know that I spoke pretty fluently.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  I assume that she was not Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">ANSWER:  No, she was not Jewish, but I, but I mean she, she didn't mean this badly, she really thought that I was not able to converse and she was going to try to make my transition easier, but of course I spoke it fluently and I had a problem afterwards with how to, how to handle that. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> sketchily in my early years but it didn't do me any harm and I graduated valedictorian in the eight grade.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  Did the, did the students and teachers have any idea about your past, about where you had come from, what you had been through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  I, I don't think the students certainly did. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">At some point my teacher did, she, my teacher also was the quote, sewing teacher for the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and so one afternoon when we had sewing, she got me aside and had me tell her the story and so I know she was curious and she had me talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">But listen, it isn't just that those children didn't know about it, people didn't talk about it here, nobody talked about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">QUESTION:  Your family neither?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  In my family, my parents were part of the conversation because my father was my Uncle Benjamin's brother and my mother and my Aunt Leah had been best friends in the time they were young wives and they'd had their children together and spent a lot of time in each other's company, so the conversation was much about the times gone by. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">But not, they did not try to draw me out on the experiences during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Once in awhile they got into the conversation or I would mention something, but they didn't try to make me talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And certainly, other people, outsiders of the family, this was not a subject of conversation, first of all, many Jewish people who we knew had similar histories. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Everybody, I guess, had lost people. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">It was a subject very painful for a lot of people, it was raw, it was part of their own lives, or else they had lost people to these kind of things and there was I think also a feeling that they've been through enough, why should we make them talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">It's only really in the 1980's that this became a subject for general conversation, it was not done. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And there was also a feeling, certainly in the 50's, 40's and 50's that one tried to shield children from hearing bad things, 1t wasn't like now when violence is an every day thing on the TV. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">It would not, you, one would not have put a child in the position of telling other children about these experiences, it would have been deemed not proper.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  Between the fifth and the eighth grade, was the eighth grade where you were valedictorian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">QUESTION:  Did you know other Jewish children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  I would venture...
QUESTION:  Other then your relatives?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">ANSWER:  I would venture to say that my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kew Gardens</span> was 80 percent Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Maybe not 80 perhaps in those years it was 60 percent Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">We certainly wouldn't, my aunt and uncle would not have moved into a community that did not have <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and you know and other Jewish children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">QUESTION:  Was going to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> an important part of your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">ANSWER:  Absolutely, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I, we were affiliated, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , five, four days a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on Saturday morning, did that even when no one else went. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Both Freddy and I did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And Freddy was Bar Mitzvahed at there and I became active when I was old enough to do that, _ being a leader in the <span class="BUILDING">youth center</span> and you know, it was very much a focal point of my existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I retained the observance as I thought my mother would have wanted me to and Freddy was a little bit more lax about that as boys are wont to do and that caused me some aggravation and it was important enough for me so that when I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , Forest Hills High School, the social life revolved around sororities, which meant Friday nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I did not join a sorority and I was pretty well an outsider, I was an oddball and I had ambitions for the stage and joined play production and eventually did get a role or two and walked from my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kew Gardens</span> to those performances in Forest Hills High School on Friday night and Saturday and did that with a lot of trepidation. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And religion has remained to this day, certainly an important thing, important core in my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">QUESTION:  How about being an American, was there a point at which or can you identify a point which you began to feel like an American?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  I pretty quickly, I pretty quickly internalized some American things that made me feel good about <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">For one thing, I want to remind you, that in the 1940's and '50's, children entered <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the morning, stood up and pledged allegiance to the flag every day and stood up when the flag came, when you heard the Star Spangled Banner and those of us, not just those of us who were refugees and came here, but people of that era, to this day, are more patriotic, if such a thing 1s possible to say, than young people who are growing up today. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">We tend to honor the flag and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">In addition to that, my Uncle Benjamin thought of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> as the land of savior, you know, they were, they were also refugees as was all my family, I mean we were all, my whole family, there was nobody really in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , everybody was in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And I have correspondence from my parents to their family and friend, hundreds of letters that got saved and sent and kept with my mother's artifacts, with non-Jews during the war and I, I have possession of those. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And I've spent really hours looking at those and what emerges from them is this tremendous feeling of people that are bound up with hundreds, a far flung family, you married and you then acquired your spouse s family as well and your spouse's spouse's. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">They drew in their family and then you became family with the spouse's spouse's spouse's. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And so I have letters like that, the middle of a tremendous network, it was a very close merging of family and friends, I mean it was one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And so when all of that got stopped one day by that maniac in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and everybody tried to get out, those who made it and who made it here and who worked hard and reestablished themselves, my Uncle Benjamin came here with a few dollars in his hands one day, got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , where he was dropped off after he arrived here, took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> , which, I mean he didn't even know his way, had heard about 42nd Street and <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span> , got instruction how to go there, found an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on the fifth floor walkup and opened his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and he and he became a successful optical wholesaler again, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">He considered <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> as the golden land, the <span class="REGION">land</span> that had saved him. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">He considered President Truman somewhere up there with the deities. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And there was a lot of talk about that, I mean we respected <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> as I did as a <span class="REGION">land</span> that had given us, you know, a chance to come and to, to work and so we were very patriotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I remind you also that not until 20 years later was there any criticism above the president at the time, President Roosevelt and the Congress for not, you know, opening up the <span class="DLF">door</span> and saving people, which of course in retrospect we all realize should have happened but at that time, I mean we went, everyone, all the Jewish refugees and the non-Jewish refugees who came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> after the war found this a land of opportunity and equality and you know, <span class="NPIP">place</span> where you could start and didn't matter what you had been, if you wanted to become something you could and we were very patriotic about that and I internalized that very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I became a citizen on my, at my own right, since I had no parents, so you know, I had to and I was, I was old enough so requirements for citizenship for me were until I was 18 I was not a citizen so at the age of 18 I was sworn in, 1n Abbot's(ph) field, I went with Freddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  But Freddy couldn't?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  No, Freddy became a citizen in his own right when he became 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">The ceremony was in Abbot's(ph) field, was crowded, crowded, it was a beautiful day, I was sworn in and somewhere, along with the other 20,000 people who were there, we all stood and we took the oath, I was very proud to do that and some reporter was roaming around saying, "Anybody here have an interesting story?" </span><span class="sentence" id="269">You know, but I wasn't going to push myself forward on that, but as he went past me, I said to him, "Well, I was interviewed when I came here." </span><span class="sentence" id="270">He said, "Oh," and he, and he took my story, so I have an article about me on the day I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> with picture and I have an article about me on the day I became a citizen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">QUESTION:  Do you remember the date?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I know it was in the spring and the sun was shining and it was Abbot's(ph) field.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  Let's go to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">We're moving now to tape two. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">End of Tape 1. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Tape 2
QUESTION:  Not only becoming 18 is a major passage of life, but becoming an American citizen is a major passage of life and how your life proceeded into a new passage and how maybe the past always had some influence on that, from there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  Well, after <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">For a lot of reasons I did not pursue going out of town. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">A lot of reasons and I applied to <span class="BUILDING">Queens College</span> and I applied to Barnett(ph) here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , women's undergraduate part of <span class="BUILDING">Columbia University</span> and I was accepted Barnard with a scholarship, a partial scholarship, Freddy was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kew Gardens</span> , living there, his last year of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and so I commuted. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">In those years it was still possible to put yourself through <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , a thing that is no longer possible, but when I started Barnard it was 823 dollars a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I had a 350 dollar scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I had received something called a general _ foundation scholarship when I graduated <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , which paid me 25 dollars a semester, which I used toward textbooks, in the plural, cause you could do that cause we went to use, to buy used textbooks, 1t was possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I worked at the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue youth center</span> and made money that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I worked summers as drama counselor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , so that I got paid more than other counseloring jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And I took a job every single June with Olsen's(ph) Temporary Service. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And it was quite possible to, if you, if you had your living taken care of and I was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kew Gardens</span> and eating, for a young person to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and pay their tuition with the help of a scholarship, that was quite possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Course it would not have been possible if, if I could not have lived at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kew Gardens</span> , but even the tuition, which is unthinkable today, I mean no young person can possibly do that, but that was possible so I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barnard</span> and spent the four years there. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Never felt myself to be very pretty...
QUESTION:  You're kidding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">ANSWER:  Certainly in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> I felt odd man out and my friends were oddballs, we, I was not, I tried to belong to the in crowd, I, I never quite could. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">In Forest Hills High School they took, at the end of our freshman year, they, they culled out of the student body of 800 I think approximately of my year, they took 36 of us whom they tested at the end of the first year, based on our achievement of the first year and they put us together for all the math and science of the balance of the four years, they tried to give us five years in four. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And so I kind of traveled with the elite intellects of, of, of the class, for those four years and I was always a studier, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> didn't come easy, I, I always had to work very hard, I spent a lot of hours studying, as opposed to my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">My brother used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and complain that every, he had too much work, everything was too much work and then he'd sit down like for 15 or 20 minutes with the pencil writing furiously and then one time I looked up and he was __ putting on his sneakers and I said, "Where are you going?" </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And he said, "I'm going to play basketball in the <span class="BUILDING">schoolyard</span> and I said, "Well, you've just, you've just been complaining you have too much work , so what are you doing?" </span><span class="sentence" id="295">He said, "Well now I've made a schedule and what to do and I know when I'm studying for what, so now this is the schedule for playing ball." </span><span class="sentence" id="296">See now, I never was able to do that, see I would get nervous and bite my nails and work and study, so, there were some people in that group of thirty-something that they culled out, that really were extremely gifted in math and in science and I didn't have an easy time hanging on, but I did very well in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , I graduated the 10th, I think in, in, in the 800, I was number 10, I think I had a 92.8 average or something like that, I was fine and so I had been pretty spoiled cause I'd done pretty well, all of my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> years, I was, I was always an A student and in fact, I tell you what I remember, in the first grade, my mother made a big fuss, because in Europe their marking system was to 10, I mean 100 was 10. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I brought back my report card in first grade, I had a 10 in everything and an eight in penmanship and she wouldn't let me forget that. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">It was only in later years that I found a copy of my mother's report cards in <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , she was definitely a C student all the way, which I thought was quite extraordinary. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">But anyway, I was spoiled and I had, I had always had an easy time in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barnard</span> and I was not happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I was outclassed by a mile. </span><span class="sentence" id="302"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barnard</span> had, certainly at that time, a large percentage of it's students had come from <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I was a product of the public school system and most of it, Forest Hills High School, was definitely one of the top <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , but we had done things by rote. ______ </span><span class="sentence" id="304">you learn something, you memorized it, you took a test and you spewed it back out. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I got to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , I had to write a term paper, I had never written a term paper in my life, I didn't even know how to go about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I mean, what we wrote were more like compositions, but there were no term paper, a research paper? </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I hadn't the foggiest notion. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I had girls in the class who had been doing independent research at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barnard</span> you know, people who really knew what they were doing and I, I was under pressure to maintain my scholarship and I hadn't yet learned how to sift out the important stuff from the unimportant, so I tried very hard to keep up on all of it and you couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So, I had no time while I was in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> to learn anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I, I just spend my time doing, but not learning and I regret that a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I don't have good recollections of those four years, they were very tense all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">When I was growing up and I knew I couldn't be an actress cause it would not work well with my, with my religious inclinations not to work on Saturday, I probably wouldn't have made a go of it anyway, but anyway, I, I, I gave up my pretensions for that, I decided to be a schoolteacher, I had worked with children all of my life when I could have been considered not a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I'd done the youth service and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and I really was very good with children and I was going to be a schoolteacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So when I came out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barnard</span> , I, I became a teacher of the fifth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I had done my student teaching at the <span class="BUILDING">Dalton School</span> and then taught fifth grade at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ridgewood</span> , which is on the Brooklyn-Queens borderline. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And somewhere in that first year I decided that all my life I had been in a <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I started out on one side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and now I was on the other side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and I was curious to see what life was like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> as a grown person, not in a <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">So I decided to take a year off. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I took that trip, this was now, I graduated <span class="BUILDING">college</span> in '58, so I taught <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for '58 to summer '59 and I went to Europe and <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , that was that, that summer, that trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Freddy had graduated <span class="BUILDING">college</span> that year and he also, he decided not to wait, to work a year, he decided to, to go to Europe that year too, we went separately. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">He left before me and he took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> across and then he rented a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> on the continent, a little Renault Defeen(ph), which looks like a tin can that you can pick up. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But I had already been working for a year and I decided to do it, Freddy was going to stay at <span class="BUILDING">youth hostels</span> all over and my mother's mother, my grandmother was alive in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> still at that time and we decided to combine our trips, individual trips to Europe by meeting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> towards the end of the summer and going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> together to visit my grandmother, whom we knew, she had come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in the intervening years to visit with my mother's sister, my Aunt Mary and had gone back to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and so we went individually to Europe and Freddy, we, we went to see Freddy off on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> on the day that he sailed and he also was seen off by the lady who became my sister-in-law, Rachel and that was really when I first realized that she might very well be, become my sister-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And Freddy and I had agreed to give each other messages whenever we were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , by leaving each other messages in the <span class="BUILDING">American Express offices</span> , so that whenever we came, because that's where we picked up mail in those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">If you went around with a very loose itinerary, you know, I knew I was going to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and then from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and he had his loose schedule, without knowing what <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> we were going to, but so that was how people frequently communicated. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And so I did that and he did that and we would find messages from each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And then I left a message for him when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> on a Friday and on Saturday he appeared in my, in my <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> because he had gone to American Express, picked up and, and he found my note and he knew where I was staying, so we decided then to travel from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> through <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> together, since we were supposed to meet in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> anyway in a matter of two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and he had the Renault Defeen(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="329">We should have never done that, bad mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Because we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> the next day and got into a car accident almost immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Poor Freddy, he really felt very bad about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">We were driving along on a <span class="DLF">country lane</span> , there was a tiny little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in front of us and that man suddenly made a left turn, into a <span class="DLF">field</span> of wheat. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I mean we, we, we, it was just, we didn't know there was a <span class="DLF">road</span> there, to make a left turn and we banged into him with our little tin can, I was thrown up against the <span class="DLF">windshield</span> and broke my nose. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Actually we didn't know I broke my nose, but I was bleeding and, and I said to Freddy, whose German was not terrific any more, I said, "Don't worry about it, I'll handle it." </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , like a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">circus car</span> , came this huge man. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And he spoke what is known as SwitzerDutch(ph), which is absolutely not related to the German that I, I mean I couldn't understand him, he couldn't understand me, it was a terrible situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Anyway we got it sorted out, we were towed and we got into a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lausanne</span> and had to lay up there for three days while the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was repaired. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Some lady doctor came to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , assured me my nose was not broken, but it really was, cause I have the, I can feel it to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And in the course of those three days, it was Freddy's birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">We went to the top of the yungfrau(ph) together and we fought terribly and came evening times, I mean my brother was a 22 year old young man on the loose in Europe and he wanted to have a good time, but he felt responsible for the sister so he started hanging around with me in the evening, it didn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">At three days we decided this was not good and he went his way and I went my way by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we met up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , as we were planned to and then went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> happily together and then drove

<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  It was very special, my grandmother was actually, whom we had seen a few years before that, my grandmother was living in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> with her son, my mother's brother and his family, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And actually I had never met my, my mother's brother, my uncle Elias(ph) and his family and so it was a very, very special 10 days that we were all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And it was my first trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and that was a exciting thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">As I told you, my mother had rehearsed Freddy and me in addresses, in case we were separated during the war and one address was 503 Fifth Avenue and the other one was 108 <span class="DLF">Benyahuda(ph) Street</span> , which was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , which was her brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">So of course my mother had told us a lot about her family there and my Uncle Elias(ph), her, her, her brother and his children, one of whom was close in age to Freddy and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And so it was a very nice experience and the first of my visits to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And when I came back to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> after that summer, I told you I had decided to take some time out from teaching and I decided to make myself available to the business world. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">So, having been an academic students, not what we used to call commercial students in those days, you went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , you either got an academic diploma or a commercial diploma, I of course was academic, I had always stuck my nose up at things like typing and shorthand and had a three finger method of typing my papers in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">So when I offered myself to the business world, you see, nobody wanted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">They all wanted to know what I could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I said, "Well what do you mean, what I can do, I'm intelligent, I'm a Barnard graduate, I was a teacher." </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And they would say, "Yes, yes, but what can you do, can you type? </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Can you do shorthand?" </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Again I want to tell you, this is the 50's now. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Freddy went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barnard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">When he graduated, the recruiters came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> and be interviewed by the young men graduating. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">On my side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Broadway</span> there was no such a thing as a recruiter, our top English graduate got a scholarship to I think, secretarial school. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">When a girl wanted to go into publishing, she was advised she should go in as a typist or secretary and work her way up. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I venture to say not a boy was told that. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I think too, even, even at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barnard</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barnard</span> really has a tradition of professional, of women who be, who've entered the professions, but most, most of them did not do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I mean not very many went to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> or <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> certainly not in those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">It's only in retrospect that I realize I should have gone to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> , a thought that never entered my mind and I probably would have been good as a lawyer, because my mind works that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">But at those, in those years, certainly, there were things women, professions like teaching that women thought about readily and the others you didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">We concentrated more on working and, and getting married and having children and so we weren't fixated on careers for a lifetime, we were interested in having interesting work experiences, but not necessarily lifetime careers. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">There was a lot of talk about teaching is a good profession cause you get the summers off, you know, that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Certainly that has been a great thing of the women's movement I think, the fact that women are, are, are encouraged to think about working as a fulfillment of life, perhaps not all good in the sense of what happens to children today, but certainly, if I think back, that it never dawned on my, you know, to go for... And this was from a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where there was a lot of emphasis on that, the president of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barnard</span> at the time was a woman who encouraged that a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">So...
QUESTION:  So Freddy was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> and you were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barnard</span> , still together...
ANSWER:  Well...
QUESTION:  In parallel.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  Well together in the sense that, you know, if we were not going out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , if we were not going to be going out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and staying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , then, in terms of <span class="BUILDING">Ivy League schools</span> or the top of the heap, there was <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span> and, and since we were not going to be able to <span class="BUILDING">dorm</span> , most of the people who graduated with us, if they did not dorm, went on to <span class="BUILDING">Queen's College</span> , you know, in their <span class="DLF">backyards</span> and then, you know, lived at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , if you're going to live at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , that was as close as we came, so, yeah we were together, but that was really not because we were together, it's because we both were able to qualify for top <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and, and that was the top <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , certainly within commuting distance, I commuted every day, it was more than an hour each way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">QUESTION:  And he still lived in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">ANSWER:  He lived at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> also.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">QUESTION:  And after his graduating...
ANSWER:  Well he took, you see he, he, my mother had, my mother's brother in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , Elias(ph) had been trained as an engineer and my mother got it into her head early on, she used to tell, Freddy used to be found with hammers and nails and taking things apart and exploring so she always said he's going to be an engineer just like her brother and I guess that stuck in his mind and he in fact took a five year engineering program at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> and, which they were able to do in four years, he came out with a BS instead of a BA, having done two years in the <span class="BUILDING">engineering school</span> and he graduated with an engineering degree as, so yes, then he graduated the year after me and he announced that he was going to get married to that young lady, who name is Rachel and she 1s his wife today, they have three children, live in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherry Hill</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> and that is where he has lived, really since he graduated, he, at the end of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> the recruiters came and Freddy accepted a job with RCA which was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camden</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">To my great relief because he had spend time in <span class="REGION">California</span> and all that and I was terrified that he was going to move to <span class="REGION">California</span> and I guess I would have moved with him by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">So when they were married, they moved in commuting distance to his work in, in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camden</span> , so they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haddenfield(ph</span> ) in the <span class="REGION">Cherry Hill area</span> and have moved, you know, from that little <span class="INT_SPACE">garden apartment</span> into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and then into the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that they still occupy in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherry Hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">They had, eventually, three children, the oldest, Natalie, who is now 30 years old and the two twins, who were born triplets, and were triplets for a few days and those young ladies are now going to be 28 and the twins are married and Natalie will get married this September. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">They are the love of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">My sister-in-law and my brother have been very generous in letting me share 1n those children's upbringing, I, I did it with malice aforethought, I made them my little dumplings from the time that they recognized me and have spent a lot of time with them, took them on cruises and trips to the Caribbean in their growing up years and in general, you know, have inveigled myself into their hearts and lives, so that to this day, they are my friends and indeed, the oldest one, Natalie, lives in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that I own not far from here, the one that I lived in before I moved here. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And she live on <span class="DLF">58th Street</span> and since she is now a grown woman, I have been very fortunate in having her not only live near me, but like me enough to make me her friend and so we, we do things together, we go to the opera and the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> together and you know, I, I don't have children of my own, a thing that I mind a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And the fact that I've had these three children and my sister-in-law has generously allowed me to really be part of their lives and not resented me for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Being an aunt, you know, it, it's like being a grandparent, I guess, it's the best of all possible worlds, you have none of the responsibility for discipline and all the opportunity for bribery by being nice and so, you know, if a mother and father are resentful, it can make that hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Rachel and Freddy have been very generous and have allowed me to do my bit with them, so that they've been as close as, you know, it is possible for nieces to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">QUESTION:  I have nieces also, I relate, identify with what you're talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I, I wanted to ask you something that you had talked about before and that was that there was time when no one talked about these experiences and you, you mentioned the 80's and how, when people started talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">When people started talking, for instance with your nieces, have you talked with them, have they asked you or when did you begin to feel that it was, was all right for you to talk about this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">ANSWER:  I always thought so, I, I never had a problem talking about it, but you know, it's not something you, you didn't go around playing with your friends and say, oh by the way, do you know that this and this, what happened to me, I mean it was not, you just didn't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">But when it came up, I, I have always considered the war years a part of my life in the following way, first of all, my recollection of my parents in intimately bound up with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I mean I can't separate the war years from my recollections of my mother and my father and so I certainly was, I guess I've made that clear by now that I, I find my, my mother's memory to be a very important thing to me and I had no intention of glossing over her life or my recollection of her life and, and that's part and parcel of those years, so I have never had difficulty thinking back, cause I have always wanted to remember her and that's part of it and I've really not ever had a problem discussing it, I've never found that I broke down or couldn't talk about it in any way. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I've always been able to do that, I felt, in the early years, certainly in the 50's, as a child, you don't want to be different so you don't call attention to those kinds of things and as a, as a grown up I always try to make sure that if the subject came up that I didn't bore people to tears with it or you know, had them morbidly interested in me as a freak of some kind, but I never minded talking about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I always thought, you know, that that was okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">QUESTION:  Was there talk, was there <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , was there <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , I'm talking about a kind of a intellectual, emotional space within the context of your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">religious community</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , to talk about, was this an important...
ANSWER:  No, again, you asked first about my class, were there other Jews, that I, did know other Jews besides my family? </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Well, for the most part you know, people tend to move where there are people like them, so I don't know where you're from but certainly Jewish people tend to move to communities, especially observant Jews, tend to move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> where there are other observant Jews, so we did that, that was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kew Gardens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">There were no other refugees from the war in my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when I went to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , not children who actually were survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">There were children of children who were survivors, but not actual children, so Freddy and I were different in that way, but you know, ____ when it came to our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , I guess 80 percent of them had fled Hitler at some point between the 30's and the 40's and so the difference again was that the children in my <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , again were not the survivors, but their, but their parents were the survivors so this wasn't strange for anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I don't know if you know but in the Jewish religion there is a memorial prayer for the dead that is said on the festival holidays, on the last day of the festival holidays and it is traditional for the people who still have parents to not remain inside the <span class="INT_SPACE">sanctuary</span> at the time that this is said, so they go out and they come back in after that prayer is said. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Well I was very conscious of the fact, in the growing up years that there weren't any other children that hung around for that prayer. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">But in no other way, I think the people, when we first moved in, since everybody was refugees, my family were also refugees and there wasn't much made of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Some people knew that of course I did not call the adults with me mother and father or mom and dad, but aunt and uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And so, but there was a time when that was pretty common among survivors you know, so yeah, there's, it didn't become a commonplace today, you know, when people hear that I am a survivor, I, I notice their pupils dilate and they look at me with a newfound interest, even people I've known. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I got a call about a year ago, from my accountant. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I have a business in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> now and I have an accountant. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">When I started with this accountant he was a young man of no consequence. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Now he's the biggest accounting firm on <span class="REGION">Long Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And I don't have day to day contact with him, I work with somebody who is employed by him. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Well, I got a phone call and it said, "Miss Kurz? </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Hold the phone for a moment for Mr. Isrelloff(ph)." </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So I got, I held on the the phone and Bob Isrelloff(ph) came on. "</span><span class="sentence" id="407">Hey," he said, "Dorian(ph), I just came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , I visited the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> and I pushed some buttons on an interacting and I was just amazed, there was a name there, Dorian(ph) Kurz and I said to myself, well there can only be one of those and I pressed the button and there you were on the screen, I had no idea." </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Well, now Bob Isrelloff(ph) hasn't made a call to me in perhaps 20 years, you see, but the fact that I was one of the survivors caught his interest and that has happened to me a couple of times. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">It 1s now that people find you interesting or oddball or noteworthy, if you are a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">In the 40's and 50's this was not noteworthy, it was more commonplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">You ask about my nieces and whether they were, when they were growing up, were interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I will tell you that when I was invited to do the, the history for the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , which I, the visual one that I gave in 1990, one of the reasons that I was keen on doing it was not so much for historical reasons, because I knew there were many people who could give their histories, but one of the reasons I wanted to do it was because I was told I would have a copy of that tape and I wanted my brother's children to have that visual story because again, growing up, I mean children are not very interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">You know, when, I was born in the year 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">When people talk about the first World War, I glaze over a little bit, it's somewhere there before I was born and you know how things are before you were born, they're ancient history, they have no relevance. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Well, my nieces were born, not just after World War 2, but a long time after World, World War 2, World War 1, what do they know one from the other or the Civil War, the Revolutionary War, the Crimean War, I mean it's all one to people who weren't living at that time and I want them to know the story and I was anxious for them to have a copy of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And, so that was definitely one of the reasons that I was keen to do that visual history. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And that made me think about other children who maybe didn't have an aunt or a father who were survivors, who should have an opportunity, if they link in, to, to get stories, you know, even in 200 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">We, we hear today, stories about the Revolutionary War and we don't relate to it directly and we don't have George Washington or the soldiers of the continental army to really talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">It would make it more immediate, it would make it not so long time ago and what relevance does it have to us and I think those histories are important for that reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Not just for to counteract the revisionists, but to allow another generation to make this not be ancient history, but to pull it up into something that happened to another person, who looks just like them, it's real, it happened to that person that I'm looking at. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">In the case of my nieces, it will be more immediate than that and they are women now and married and they're going to have families of their own very shortly and those children will grow up and hear about the events of World War 2 and what happened to people, the Jews and other in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And I want those, I want my brother's grandchildren to look at those visuals and see those visuals as something that happened really to them, because their father almost did not survive, which meant that those children were not going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And for other children, who do not have direct contact in a linear way with the events of that time, I think seeing an actual film of a survivor will cause them to have more connection to that than when we hear about the Revolutionary War. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">So I think that it is important from that point of view.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="425">QUESTION:  I do too. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I want to move over to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="427">end of side one, tape 2]
QUESTION:  We're going to have some, just final thoughts and then Dorian has to go to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">ANSWER:  She does. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Well I don't know, final thoughts are kind of hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">I, I, I have a couple of them, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I notice that both Freddy and I are doers, we're very practical people. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I think that that is a direct result of our early lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">We, we are, we tend, we are survivors in more ways than one. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I am not a complainer. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I tend to take command, I tend to grab ahold of my life and make things happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">It turned out I couldn't get a job when I, I was always saying, you know, nobody wanted me and all that and eventually I learned how to do some shorthand and___ around in a couple of jobs for a couple of years and it became apparent to me that I couldn't really work for others, I had to work for myself and I opened up a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I have been a <span class="BUILDING">retailer</span> now, on some scale or other, since 1965 and have a pretty large <span class="BUILDING">store</span> right now, takes up about a half a <span class="DLF">block</span> and I have 13 employees. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And I find I become more bossy and more take charge as I go along. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I, but I'm very, I am and have been very practical and I tend to, not kind of sit back and let life happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I notice Freddy is the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">We are more controlling and definitely tend to manipulate our lives, rather than to be manipulated by it and I think that's very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">In a way, we are both stronger people, I think, than many of the people that I meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Most certainly there are scars, now I did not marry. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I did have a relationship for 30 years with a man whom I could not marry. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Consequently I don't have children. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">He was an older man, almost twice my age when we met and I knew that I should not be in that relationship, but I was unable to help myself, I, I, I had a nervous breakdown a couple of times when I tried, especially in the early years to stop that. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I lay that off directly on my early years. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I needed to be loved and admired by an older man and I needed that support and that ego lift. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And I, I think, that is, is a direct result of the loss of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">My father when I was six and my mother later, I think I needed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I needed to be the special person in somebody's life again. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And that, of course, affected my personal life, even in the fact that, the fact that I'm a retailer, cause you know, I mean, then if you don't have a normal marriage and children, then you do other things and so what I did is I really filled up my life and all the little nooks and crannies so now I don't have any time to myself at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And Freddy, who does have a family and a lovely wife and wonderful children, well that still, he is a very closed up person. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">He was not invited to make that original tape at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , he came with me that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">His memory of the early years is much more sketchy than mine and sometimes when I talk, he will remember something, it's much more sketchy. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">He now gives talks, as a survivor, to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in his <span class="REGION">area</span> quite frequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">He started doing that since my tape was made. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">But he is a much more closed person, he is emotionally, I hope he never hears this tape...
QUESTION:  I don't think he would.</span></p>
