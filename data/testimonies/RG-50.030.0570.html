<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  We stayed — we stayed there for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Well, we — during the bombing, my — my — my mother sent my brother out to get bread, there was a tremendous <span class="DLF">bread line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And he would bring <span class="BUILDING">home</span> rotten bread, or whatever kind of bread we could get, and the bombs were falling, and you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And my mother would prepare this bread in rancin — rancid oil that we kept so we could, you know, fry the bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And the only food we had was garlic. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So we would have this rotten bread and rancid oil with — spread with garlic. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And you know Judy, it was the most delicious thing in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">But, soon after that, when the war — we were liberated by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And soon after that, I guess it was early part of 1946, I think it was the year — I’m not sure what part of the year it was, but my brother and my father decided they would go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">We remained in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I don’t remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">But my brother and father went, and he came back with stories that were just incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">That was the time of the pogroms. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Soon after the war, when Jews were coming back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and my father and brother went to see our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and they knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and some Polish people were living there, and they slammed the <span class="DLF">door</span> in his face, saying, you were supposed to be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So at that — right after that, this pogrom had started, and they escaped by this much from getting killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They survived the war, but they were so scared that they would — yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So, we went back — they went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and my father told my mother, there’s nothing there for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  So-
ANSWER:  And at that time my father, he survived the whole war without being arrested, but at that time he was arrested by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Because my father was bootlegging at that time, and the Russian soldiers got sick from — from this drink, and they arrested my father for selling bad liquor to the Russians.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  How long was he in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  Not — not terribly long, not terribly long. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">But, he had to make a living, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  So, how long did you remain in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Well, we — we left soon after that, because I know we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gabersee</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So, we left that in 1949. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">So we must have left <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in °46.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  And did you have any trouble getting out of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  I don’t recall that at all, I think we were just — you know, we made arrangements and we were placed in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And we were there for three years, and even though we had family here in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , it was — I’m sure, you know, it took forever to get the papers, and —
QUESTION:  What was life like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  From what I remember as a child, it was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I had friends, I had schooling, I had food. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I was a little bit of nothing, and so that was life, and it was good.</span></p>
