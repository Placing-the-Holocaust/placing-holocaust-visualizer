QUESTION:  And I just want to ask you, say a little bit more about who were you, or what -- why were you Tadeusz Zaleski --
ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  -- at one <span class="NPIP">point</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Who were you, and those different names.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Yeah, now when I was born Naftali Saleschutz, of course they had to give me a name when I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I had a lot of names, not orig -- not names, legally names, people called me all kind of names because I was not an angel when I was small. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My family called me different, my friends called me different. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">During the war, when I escaped from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and I started -- I escaped to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , I had to -- I got false -- it’s -- oh, actually, it was not false, it was a real birth certificate from a monsignor and he gave me the name -- I picked out the name because the -- the name belonged to a friend of mine who went with me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and dur -- 1939 he was in the army, he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And I picked out his name because he s -- he -- we looked very much alike, like we would be brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And his name was Tadeusz Jadach. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">It’s a very good Polish name. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">So I asked the monsignor, so he gave me his birth certificate and I started to masquerade when I was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , as Tadeusz Jadach. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Then, during this time, I also belonged to a Russian group, a Russian partisan groups for a short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">So there I got the other document in my name as Naftali in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , su- supposed to be Anatoli, it’s changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So I liked Anatoli, so I got a paper as 3February 9, 2001 Sherbakov, which is a real Russian name, so I became Anatoli Sherbakov. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Then, when I d -- was liberated, and I joined the Polish army, and the Polish army didn’t want me to have the same name as I had in the underground, as Tadeusz Jadach, because there was all political mis -- they didn’t believe in the same ideology, so I changed the name to Tadeusz Zaleski, it should be similar to my original name Saleschutz, so it became Zaleski. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">It could be Saleschutz but spelled different like in Polish, because the real Saleschutz was spelled like a German name. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">But then people were afraid that it -- my superiors, that it will have a connection with my name from before, so they said let’s have a new name, so Tadeusz was okay, it’s a good Polish name, so I became Tadeusz Zaleski. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Then later when I was in the -- in the Polish army, I was in the intelligence, and I had special -- you -- in a special unit, so for a certain time I had to be -- to have a German name, because we had to interduce -- to in -- interrogate German officers, but there is a long story in my book about it, so I had a friend, his name was Lazarus Spillman, so I made out documents that I am Lazarus Spillman. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> -- so I came -- I got back to my real name, Naftali Saleschutz, but for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> the Saleschutz was too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">People don’t have time to spell, everybody ask how do you spell it. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So because I had a brother in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and his name was Salsitz, so I change it to Salsitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And Naftali they thought is a too Jewish name, so I became Norman, which I’m sorry til today because I like 4February 9, 2001 Naftali much better than Norman, and this is how I remain. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So do -- this is -- this is my name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  This is your many names.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  Okay, I want to skip certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So-So-Some -- some things that we don’t talk about will be summarized in the middle of narration. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">But I would like you to talk about- about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Why did you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , when did you go, and what position did you have? </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I want to talk about the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> scene [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Whe -- when I went into the Polish army after I was liberated -- I was liberated in the beginning of August 1944, and I right away wanted to go to the army because I figured if I survived the war, I have to fight the Germans, and this was my aim, because my father’s last words was, Nakuma, nakuma, nakuma. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">It means revenge, revenge, revenge, take revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I figured how can I take revenge? </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I have to be in the army in a special unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And then I was sent to a -- from a -- in --in -- the government was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , the Polish government, temporary government, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was not liberated, and then later I was sent from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szeszow</span> , because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szeszow</span> was a bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> near my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> , and I know <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szeszow</span> -- I knew <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szeszow</span> and I knew the surrounding and I knew the people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So I was in this time -- we call it informatsia voickowa, which means -- this was the political unit 5February 9, 2001 in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">It was -- so a -- when then -- the 12" of January, 1945, was the left -- the less [indecipherable] towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , towards the -- take over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szeszow</span> , when I was liberated, the front stopped, the front stopped in August. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And for six months nothing happened, they stayed in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and they made all the preparations for the final push. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">The January the 12" the war started -- I mean, the [indecipherable] started towards the west, and this was actually the last [indecipherable] til the war was ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Now I was picked out -- in this time they picked out a group f-fo -- of hundred young, mostly officers, and we were assigned to go with the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">As the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> went, we went right with them, and from the hundred, soon as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was liberated, some of us remained in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to establish a Polish presence, and to start to organize -- organize security, and -- and <span class="BUILDING">civil offices</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had some people left, two or three. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I was assigned to do the same thing, but til we will re -- reach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">When we reach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> -- so from the hundred remained maybe 50 or 60, and we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , and I was assigned to the same units, which was the military -- the military intelligence, but my si -- my par - there were a lot of sections. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">People had the section with the clergy, people had the section with the civil organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I -- my section was that I had to do with Germans who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , or who remained in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , or Polish people who collaborated with the Germans -- and they changed during the occupation, they made out papers 6February 9, 2001 that they are ethnic Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And because I spoke German, so I was attached to this unit, and also we had a lot of German prisoners of war, so I interrogated them, and this is how I became the head of the county f -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> for this reason, for this purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  I will summarize the story of how you met your wife, because it is a long one --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  -- and we have only 15 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  But I would like to talk about afterwards, so what -- so when -- once you had taken care of the columns, that was disconnected, the -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakéw</span> was saved, what were the other jobs? </span><span class="sentence" id="55">You had a lot of work to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">What was basically ho -- what did you work, and -- and what was the situation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , and what did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  Well, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakéw</span> was -- luckily <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> was not touched. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">It was not destroyed y -- like other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> for instance, was 90 percent destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="60"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> was not destroyed and this is in the book with this -- it had to be destroyed because the Germans prepared for a destruction, and they prepared 287 colu -- <span class="NPIP">places</span> where -- were mined, and the 287 I remember distinctly because this was our main em -- th -- main thing to eliminate those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> wasn’t destroyed, but our -- our da -- duty, what we had to do the first thing, we had to clin -- to get rid of the people who 7 February 9, 2001 collaborated with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Mostly Germans they left, the army left, but there were some who remained. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But the people who collaborated, now they were Polish people, but during the German occupation they made out papers, and they find ways that their grandfather was from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , or great grandfather was a colonist. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And e -- sometimes even if 1t was not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">They wanted to do it, why? </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Because doing this they became ethnic Germans, and the German gave them bigger ration cards, they could get a nicer <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and they could get a good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Even the Polish people who were sent away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , and they were -- didn’t have the rice, they had more rice, and they were the elite during the German occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Now, as the Germans left, those people tried to be back Poles, because actually they were Poles, they were traitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">So naturally our aim was to find out, to interrogate them, and to find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">If they came from different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , if they started having new papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So mostly this was our aim, and this was also for the security of the government not to have enemies in our <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So this was the main things that we had to have. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Then I got an -- a special job. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">This was -- now we occupied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , officially occupation was the 19" of January, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">This was official date. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I was two days before in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , but this was the official date when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> was occupied do -- by the Russian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And -- and the only Polish unit was our unit that we came in and that we were the -- the first who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , and the people looked up to us that we are the liberators. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">In beginning, or 1-1- 8 February 9, 2001 in th -- in beginning of February, a group came from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and this was the -- organization to study the crimes of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And the head of this group was Hewlett Johns -- Johnson. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">He was the Dean of Canterbury from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">He was a archbishop and he was the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And he had in his group mostly professors from different <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> who were not a g -- who -- who didn’t work with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Like in Europe a lot of <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> collaborated, and they had armies like <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Those were professors from <span class="NPIP">places</span> that they were always against the Germans, or the Germans were occupying their <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">We had professors from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , from -- from <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> , from all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And I was assigned that I was to prepare -- I had to prepare every day’s activity for this group where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">We went to all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , to -- like for instance, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> maybe two weeks after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Everything was fresh. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">The de -- the destruction of the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> , they we -- still were hot from- from -- from fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">The clothing of the people that they were -- were killed, and they were still, the blood was still soft, because it wasn’t dry up. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And then th-the -- the <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> from children’s shoes, and eyeglasses, and [indecipherable] and all those thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">This was just in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And we found in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> also, about 20 to thir -- 25,000 people who couldn’t be sent out with the death marches like they did before the Russians occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So I went with this group for about four, five weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">9 February 9, 2001 Every day we -- the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , and my job was to prepare the itinerary for the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Where to go, how to go, to have the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and the transportation for the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And because I spoke a little English, so they picked me out and I was the one that I explained to the man who was in charge of transportation from the Dean of Canterbury, and with him, too, and I brought them over to all those <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">During the times that we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , there was a other aim, was the Polish government wanted, is to show them how the people are very happy with the communists who came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Now this, everything was staged, nothing was the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Th -- th -- the -- Hewlett Johnson, the archbishop later had a nickname, the Red Dean, because everything -- he was very much pro-<span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">When he went, for instance to <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> in this -- later, and always he went to investigate, but he always was pro-<span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So what my -- my job was to -- to stage -- like, for instance, we went to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to a concentration camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">On the spo -- on the way, when we saw there a group of Polish peasants, and they were dressed in the Polish traditional clothing, which 1 -- this was all staged. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So I said to him, “Well, let’s find out, let’s stop and find out from the people what they think about the new regime.” </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Because they started to take away <span class="REGION">land</span> from the landowners, and gave them away to the peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So we stopped, and I asked them in Polish, and it was translated. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Now those were not peasants that we met occa -- special we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Those were people who were told to be on this <span class="NPIP">spot</span> , dressed 10 February 9, 2001 like peasants and they had all kind of m -- pitchforks and other things what peasants use. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And I said to him, oh there are peasants, it’s good to find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Now, they were prepared, those were people who were from the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Tho -- there were -- who belonged to the communist eg -- organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And they were prepared what they will be asked, and what they should a -- was -- wa -- should answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And naturally all of them said how happy they are, that before the war they were discriminated, the peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And now they come in and the government is so good for the peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And they took away from the very rich people, who never took care on their <span class="DLF">fields</span> , and they divided, they gave. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And she -- they praised -- they praised there the [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And this was everything -- naturally they made the film, and they made pictures, and this was later shown in -- in newsreels, how the Polish population, the peasants are very, very happy with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">But this -- everything was staged.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  I want to ask you just one more question about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">You also were involved to some degree in -- in food and relief efforts, right, because [indecipherable] people were coming back
ANSWER:  Yeah, I was -- not officially. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Officially I couldn’t be ra -- 1-involved because the first thing, I was not a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I -- in this time I was not -- Tadeusz Zaleski, a Polish Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And the second thing, our job was not to -- to give food to the people, to help people. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Our job was to find out collaborators and other things, but through my future 11 February 9, 2001 wife, because I started to bring her food right the next day when I met her, because there -- there was no -- you couldn’t buy food, and people didn’t have food. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So I use -- and we had everything, because in the army we had everything, so I use -- I took my adjutant or some, and I used to send to her every day, bread and salami and butter and other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Now, when the people who came out from hiding -- you didn’t have yet people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , because it took a few weeks til they started to come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But people came out from hiding, they were hungry, and they were -- they were in hiding for -- for two years, for y -- year and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">They find out that there 1s a -- somebody who survived and he is Jewish and he has food. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So they started to come to her and asked her for -- for -- for food, and she was glad to give it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Now, as she gave them the food, naturally, she notified me. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I didn’t see her so often in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">She notified me she needs more, she needs more, and I n -- not officially, sent her all kind, and she just -- and she gave it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Also, I gave her a lot of clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">As we took over a lot of <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> , where Germans left, or people who were collaborators were arrested, we confiscated their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> , and we had all the things from their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> , so I could give it to her, and she used to distribute to the people who came ba -- with their -- with their concentration clothing -- they didn’t -- it was winter, because this was in January, February, it was very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So I gave it to her and I was very happy and the people find out, and wa -- once somebody find out, there 12 February 9, 2001 were more and more and more, [indecipherable] I gave it her, she gave it -- she give it- give it away, and I was very happy I could do it, unofficially. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Then later I also find out that there was a woman, and there 1s a film made about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">They called it, “My Hundred Children.” </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And this woman collected children who were left for -- fo -- after fa -- they were hidden, and also a lot of Polish people who took in the children to hide, and they were promised money after the war, and then later they find out that the parents are killed, nobody came back, so they abandoned the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And the children didn’t have where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So the Jewish co -- committee started to collect those children, there was one woman special, and she is in -- in the book th -- what they wrote, “My Hundred Children.” </span><span class="sentence" id="141">She collected chil -- she lost all her family, so she collected those children and brought them into the Jewish committee, and they were on- they had that [indecipherable], but she didn’t had wa -- what -- how to feed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So she find out about me, because when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , and I went right away to two leaders of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , one was -- his name was -- he was involved with the Jewish committee, he was a lawyer before the war, his name was Stulbackt. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And then it was a rabbi who survived the war, not from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , but he kra -- remained, and he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , and he was like the official rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">His name was Steinberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So I came to them and I told them, “Listen, I am a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Nobody knows that I am a Jew, but I want you should know. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Any time you have a problem, and I am in the government, and I 13 February 9, 2001 have a big position. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">If you need something, please tell me, not official, and I will do what I can do.” </span><span class="sentence" id="149">In this what I -- they always came to me and the brought me problems, and -- and I have -- and now -- in -- in my new books that I writing now, “Treasure of Jewish Memories,” I’m describing those episodes fr -- from the -- what a -- for -- from this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So when -- when I find out that the children are there, they didn’t have what to wear, they didn’t have what to eat, so I sco -- I-I couldn’t give them money, and I -- so we had a lot of sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And because sugar the Germans th -- had the sugar in <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> and we took it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So I told this woman, I cannot give you money, but if you have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> -- I cannot deliver it -- you can come and pick out and I can give you as much sugar as you want, and later you sell the sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So this way they could support themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Then later they needed some clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And we took away from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> two large <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> , because the Germans had <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> for underwear, shirts and other things, for the Germans, because everything was on ration cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Now the Poles didn’t get anything, but the Germans got -- oh, and those were I find out where the <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> are, because when the germ -- before the Germans left, they put all this material in two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">They were big <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> because this was a whole [indecipherable] and I find out about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So we went and we confiscated everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So I had a lot of this material. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I remember there were children’s socks, and children’s underwear, and everything what -- so -- so I brought -- every time I came 14 February 9, 2001 over to them, so I brought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trunk</span> full of those things and I gave it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Now, they knew that I am Jewish, those few people, but the rest, they didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And when I took it out from the <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> , the people who work with me, they didn’t know why I take it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Maybe they thought maybe I take it and I sell it on <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">But I gave it away all to my girlfriend, or to the Jewish committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  When you think about the time today, you were very busy -- about that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> -- you were very busy, you had a lot of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Was that special for you, that time of fo -- and if so, for what reason?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  I think this was the best time of my -- there were two times that there were the best times of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And I think this was the best time. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">One time was the best time when I- like for instance, when I was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , naturally we starved, it was cold, and it was terrible fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">But if we could do something -- there was one time that we made a raid of -- o-on -- we made a raid, there was a -- a sop -- <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Puskov</span> , from the SS, and we made the raid, and we killed them, all of them, so I think this was the happiest day in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">As a matter of fact in my book there, somebody wrote, and in th -- in -- and what I explained to him it 1s -- it was like when I had the machine gun in my hand, it’s like a lame who couldn’t walk, and suddenly he -- he -- he was able to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">To me, that I was not any more the victim, that I wasn’t any more the pe -- the person who was killed, that I could pay back. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And this was my life why I wanted to 15 February 9, 2001 live. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">To take revenge, which I did as much as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , it was a other, naturally we couldn’t go out, we couldn’t kill people any more, it was after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">But for me to see that the people, the Jewish came ba -- the Jews came back, they had nothing, they di -- and even the Polish government was not very, very friendly with them, because individual -- maybe the government as a whole was not anti-Semitic, because in this time it was a communist government, but each individual policeman, each individual clerk, everything, he had this hate in his heart as again the same thing, they didn’t change. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Now, if I could do something, I was very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">People that I didn’t know, they find out -- they find out that -- that they could do -- through me they went to this rabbi, and if I could help them I was very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And also, also, if they needed <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> , and there was every <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , usually there was a -- a <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> where they gave out the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Now, if a Jew came for an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and even he lived before in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , they wouldn’t give it to him because the people were very, very against Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And they said, “Well, why did you come back?” </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And they looked at that Jew -- and now I’m writing a new book about the killings after the war, so the title of the book is what they used to say in the title 1s, you are still alive? </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I -- and the subtitle is, I thought they killed all of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">This was the first question -- the first that a Pole ask a Jew when he survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But when -- when -- when they went to this rabbi and the rabbi knew that he could be helped through me, I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Now this was a very, 16February 9, 2001 very rewarding thing for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Because if I started a thing, we were killed, and nobody did anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And this time we were undress -- I’m not talking I personally, but the Jews, and we were undr -- dress over a -- a -- a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> , and we were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Now if e- each one of them would think, if I would live and if I could pay them back, everybody will do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Now, after the war, people didn’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">The war is ended, and everybody was interested to have a bread, to make a living, and to save his family if he had a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">But for me, I survived for two reasons -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B
ANSWER:  -- for me, I survived for two reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And this, to -- to survive, you had to have a legacy, you had to have a reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Th-This gave you strength, otherwise you couldn’t survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And I had two. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">One was when my father was killed, he yelled to take revenge, and | -- it is now 55 - 60 years later, I still hear his si -- his screams. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">This was one that gave me strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I have to live, because I was the youngest, and I was the only one to pay back, pay back for my five sisters, pay back for my -- the sister’s husbands, pay back for my nieces and nephews. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Who would pay back? </span><span class="sentence" id="200">So this mean that they were killed, and nothing will happen to the people who did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So this was one legacy that it gave me strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">To take back the second one was when my mother was taken away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> with my five sisters to be killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> , she somehow gave to somebry -- 17 February 9, 2001 body a letter, and I got the letter from this person. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I was in [indecipherable] and she wrote to me, you are my ninth child, you are the youngest. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">You are young, you are strong, you are smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">If somebody will survive, you will survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Because she believes that somebody will survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">She said, “After the war, go to your brother,” because I had a brother in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , “go to y -- <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , go to your brother,” I had a brother in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , “and tell the whole world what the German murderers did to us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So this is the reasons that after the war, I started to tell, even in the beginning people didn’t want to listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">But I spoke, and they thought I have an obsession, some people didn’t like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Later, 20 years later, st -- people started to realize, and they listened. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Books came out, movies came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">But I started to speak the first minute I left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and I told the stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And people thought that it is something wrong with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And this gave me strength to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">That if we will not be alive, the whole world would know what a cruel thing happened 1n this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And for this reason not only I, all survivors, their duty is to write down, and to write and tell the stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Because everyone survived a different way. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Everyone had different problems and cruelties. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">So for this I am telling, and I am going out, if somebody asked me to go and speak, I don’t care where and how and when, I never took money f-for it, and I am doing it because I think this is my duty, that the people should know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">18 February 9, 2001
QUESTION:  Before we get to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , you had to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , or afer -- n-n -- I’m sorry, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> first. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Te-Te-Tell us a little bit more about some time the decision was made, or you -- you and your wife talked about would you stay or would you leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">S-Say something about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">ANSWER:  Well, then later from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , I was transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , and I became the head of the security for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> for the cow -- for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakéw</span> wa -- I was the head for the <span class="REGION">county</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> I was for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And again the same story, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> | had a lot of work, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , first thing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> was 90 percent or 85 percent destroyed, and there were a lot of Germans, and we wanted the Polish people should come in, and they should show that there is -- this became a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish town</span> , and a- and we then -- later we gave out in orders that all the Germans have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Now they left, and they had two suitcases, and this was something for me very, very important, because this was a pay back what they did to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Naturally they -- when they were sent out, when we brought them to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , we didn’t kill them th -- like in the -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szeszow</span> where I was and one day they killed 6,000 Jews, sik -- 600 Jews, then thousand Jews, by an aktia -- we call it a aktia, it means an [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">But by the Germans nobody was killed, they only had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Now the -- their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> were taken over by Polish people, and in -- in -- in -- but -- but one thing we s -- in this time also, the -- it started in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , we knew -- <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in 19 February 9, 2001 this time, and we knew <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> will have to -- the Jews will try to have their own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And as -- I always was a Zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I never became a member of the communist party, even they ask me to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">But my excuse was that I am not in th -- [ -- Iam not taught enough to know the ide -- the ideology about communism, I have to learn a little more, I have to read more and this was my excuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And my wife never wanted to stay, because my wife had very bad experience, because when the Russians came in to the -- her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanislav</span> -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanislavov</span> in 1940 -- in 1939, and they lived under co-communist regime, now the people who were well off were middle class [indecipherable] middle class they were -- th-th-the Russians tried to liquidate them. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">If they were Zionists they sent them to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , if they were rich they took away everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">So from them they took away their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , they took away the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Her father had to be a plain worker, which -- my wife wanted to study medicine, they didn’t let her in because she was a daughter of a bourge -- bourgeois family. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So she sa -- and then they saw the system 1s not for her, so she didn’t want to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And she always said, well in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> you got a king for a night, but the end we -- I don’t want. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So we started to think -- and I also, when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , I start -- well, even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , I started to work in that organization, a Zionist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Naturally the people from the organization knew that I am Jewish, and I gave them some protection, and they had to -- to -- to travel toward the 20 February 9, 2001 <span class="DLF">Czechoslovakian border</span> , I helped them. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And also, when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , I was still involved with this organization, and -- and -- and -- but -- but the end was that we had to leave, til 1t came a time that my wife said she ha -- we have to leave because the longer we will wait, it will be harder to -- to go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Now, I left first, and I left very - not organize in [indecipherable] because I went with that -- with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , through the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> , and on the way I could be caught, I we -- but it’s a long story, but I left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">QUESTION:  I want to ask you a follow up question though. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Were there other thoughts of why you wanted to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  Yo -- well, my th -- my thought -- well, see, the first thing my wife wanted to leave, of course, she had family in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pales</span> -- in is -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">She had a grandmother, she had a sister, she has three uncles with her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">So she said, well she had somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And I wanted to leave because I saw, even now -- I have a good position and everything, but I had to masquerade. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I wanted to be myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I -- why should I -- if we have a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and if we -- the communist regime is so equal, no anti-Semitic, why do I have to hide my identity? </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Why do I have to be Tadeusz Zaleski? </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Why can’t I be myself? </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And also, being a non-Jew, the people who work with me, the people who were in the government didn’t have no secrets because I was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">So then I could see that deep in -- imbedded anti-Semitism towards Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">21 February 9, 2001 And nobody was a friend sp -- in those -- in this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Even officially they couldn’t go out and say, well I hate Jews, and this and that, but inside everybody was anti-Semite. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Now, 1n the -- there were no secrets from me, so I saw that this will not be a life for me, and also my wife always said that the end will be -- see, in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , in the Russian system there were three kinds of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">People who were in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , people -- pe -- he -- people who were in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , people who are in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , and people who will be 1n <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">So the end was I -- I didn’t care how big I was, the end was if I do something -- something wrong, see, if I would be a -- a [indecipherable] if I would be a -- a communist, and I will like the regime, and I [indecipherable], so then I would say, well this is my life, and I love it. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I wasn’t -- I come from a very Orthodox, ultra-Orthodox home. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Reet -- not, I wouldn’t say millionaires, but a very comfortable <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">We were -- we were considered 10 percent of the richest people in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And the whole family was very religious, so I was not brought up to be against religion, or to hate people who have money or make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I did it because it was comfortable for me in this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">The war ended, I wanted to take revenge, and I could have a job to be acknowledged, but not as a Jew, so this was very bad for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So I knew that the end would be I will not be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">But longer my w -- my wife was very smart, she said, longer we will wait, worse it be to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And naturally I went out first, and she remained and she was arrested because they thought through her they will get me. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">So -- but I never, 22 February 9, 2001 never had my mind, because this was not a regime for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Now, we want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I was registered, and I worked with that group called Bricha. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Bricha was the one who took out people, and they smuggled them to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Now, from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> the Bricha went over to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Now, unofficially I belonged to them, because my dream was to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Because even when I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> before the war I wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">But then later we escaped and we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> there was other -- other problem to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> because you couldn’t go officially, you had to go illegally, and you wind out in <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> my wife didn’t want to go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> so we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">We said, we will go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> -- which one would come first, <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and if <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> comes first, we’ll go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and if we’re in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> we can always go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and the first money we made in 1949, so we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> -- to -- it was already <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , not <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Well, this [indecipherable] but -- but it was -- for me it was too late, because there was no war --

ANSWER:  I had to ask [indecipherable] yeah, it was difficult because in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> if -- see, I had a large family in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">My father had four brothers and two sisters and they had children. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Naturally, they were [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And we always -- and I had a brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So I wrote to them that I need affidavit, you need affidavit there, oh, my brother said he’d send me, I never got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So I never got -- so I got -- and we wanted to go at -- if we couldn’t go to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , we want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , we didn’t want to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because for me being in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , every day it was the biggest torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Because when I went in in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> , and if I saw every German, I looked at every German, I saw in every German I saw that he was the murderer of my father, the murderer of my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Every German looked to me the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And I couldn’t stay, so- and I had a lot of problems, because I remember once I went in and in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> , and -- and I was sitting on -- on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> , and there a woman, a elderly woman came in, and -- and I didn’t get up, and so one young German came in, he says, why don’t 24 February 9, 2001 you get up, she’s a old woman, and -- and -- and you are young fellow, why don’t you- so I said well, did somebody get up when my mother came in? </span><span class="sentence" id="298">My mother was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So why should I -- maybe those are the people who killed my -- so we had a argument, then later we had the fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I remember once we came in in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I saw a la -- young Jewish, they fighting with a group of young Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I didn’t ask questions, I di -- I didn’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I jumped in. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">But so happens that I didn’t look Jewish, so the Jewish people started to beat me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I said, “What are you beating me up?” </span><span class="sentence" id="305">They said, “Well, aren’t you a German?” </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I said, “No, I am Jewish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="307">So every day- every day something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So we di -- we wanted to get out, and we came -- you couldn’t go, you needed that affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So I -- my family didn’t send it to me, so the Joint Distribution, they gave out -- what they did, they didn’t give out individual affidavits, they made a group, let’s say hundred people and one affidavit, and the organization took care to show the government that we will not later stay in the -- in -- in -- and not to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">So this is how we came. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Even they paid -- they -- the Joint paid for my transportation, for the passage. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Then later I paid them back, but they didn’t know if I would pay them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">But my family didn’t do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  So when you got the visa finally, what -- what happened then? </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Where did you go, and how was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> trip? </span><span class="sentence" id="316">25 February 9, 2001
ANSWER:  When I got that visa, so we were assigned to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">But in this time, we -- we had to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> almost a half a year, because it was a coal strike in amer -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> didn’t take us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">QUESTION:  Was it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremenhaven</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremenhaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremenhaven</span> we were there 1n there they made like a staging area in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and the people you were staying there, they gave us to eat, but we couldn’t leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Now, it was also a very unpleasant <span class="NPIP">place</span> because that ger -- when -- when you got -- when you had to go to get the visa, Germans got the visa very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But course, by us, there was in this time, the consul and the co -- they -- they -- they didn’t let the Jewish people who wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , they didn’t let them to -- to see the consul. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Because they demanded documents, birth certificate, and [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Where did the Jews get documents when they came out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So every day in the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> , there were hundreds of Jews waiting that nobody could reach the consul. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">So there was one secretary and she made a business out of it, and for 200 dollars, she made that you could see the consul. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Now people start- who had money started to pay her, and everybody knew that she takes money. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Now the first thing we didn’t have the money and we didn’t want to pay, why should we pay her? </span><span class="sentence" id="330">So because my wife spoke English, I spoke a little English, I said, we have to 26 February 9, 2001 take it in our hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">So there was that general consul, I remember his name was Clarke. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And this Clarke, we said we have to see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">So once when he went for lunch, we stopped him. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And my wife said she wants to talk to him, and she -- he explained -- she explained to him that it is impossible, there are hundreds of people who want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and we cannot go because this woman demands 200 dollars for a person to let her see -- and she -- she was a partner with one of the vice- consuls, there was [indecipherable] and she was a partner and she sent it to him and they got im -- they got the visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">So she told this -- everything to the Clarke and I was standing there and he listened and listened. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">So he said, well I want you should come to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and we went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And we explained, and I remember that when we left, so he came to us and he put the hand on our head. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">He said, “Well, do you know, children like you we need in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And he changed the whole rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Instead before you needed -- she -- this woman said, “If you don’t have the documents, I don’t let -- I don’t make the application.” </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So he changed the rules, and the rules were you needed two witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And when the two witnesses gave a statement that they know you, you come from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and everything, the two witness was -- so everybody got two witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">One was a witness for him, then later he was a witness for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And then the people -- we were -- we ca -- we came them every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Then later the people knew that we made this change, and they were very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Even til today some people who 27 February 9, 2001 are here and they always remind us that we went and we had the guts to speak up. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And this way, we -- this woman was fired. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">They -- the -- the consul -- the visa consul was still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">It so happened that we were assigned -- I remember he had one le -- he was a -- a invalid, so we were assigned to him because the general consul didn’t take care on all the children, so -- on all the people, so we were assigned to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">When we were assigned to him, and -- and he didn’t ask us too many question because we had the two affidavits. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Then later he said to raise the hand and he swore us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">So I was afraid because I almost burst out in laughter, because he was the one who was a partner with this woman, and now he is giving me this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Well, we got the visa and we had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> we got stuck for six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And then later we went on the- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">liberty ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Those were the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> , th-the name was Ernie Pyle. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">This was the last time that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">liberty ship</span> , and unlucky we were cause it was in the winter, it was in January, and -- and underw -- underway it was a terrible storm, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , the boiler, everything broke and we almost drowned. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And everybody was so sick, that I was laying on the -- on -- on the [indecipherable] the -- the people, the men were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , what maybe 201 in -- in -- in this <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Now the women were 20 - 25 in their <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> , when -- and I was so sick I was laying out -- outside on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And I pray to God it’s -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> should sink. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I couldn’t take it, I didn’t eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So my wife, in this time she put on a woman’s housecoat with the woman’s pajama and the kerchief 28 February 9, 2001 on my head, and she took me in in her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And the people in her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> knew and -- that I am with her and I slept there, and this was a little better. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">But what -- we were very, very angry that the German people who went to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in this time, cause a lot of German went to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , they had family here, they had the big, best <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> , because they had money to pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And they -- the people from the company were German, so they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> and they were sitting and eating and drinking and dancing. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And we were laying like -- like dogs in -- in -- so this was very, very unfair. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">But this how they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So mo -- not only on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , on all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">So the German people had all the privileges because they were normal people and they got people who gave them those <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and they could pay for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">So then we came to -- we came to [indecipherable] we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> January the 17", and -- and -- and we were so sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">So then later, a night before, somebody said, tomorrow morning we atrive in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">So I -- I as -- how -- as sick we were, everybody di -- dragged out the -- the - the -- the best suit, with the best coat, and we were [indecipherable] and we waited half a night, we were just staying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> waiting for the Statue of Liberty. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And when the statue of -- when we saw the Statue of Liberty, everybody from us started to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Even today [indecipherable] we saw already the Statue of Liberty, and this we -- we are in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Now wa -- wa -- wa -- this was not the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Then later when we -- we went that -- they said to take out the valises and everything, so we took it out on the 29February 9, 2001 deck. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Everyone to his initial, N to N, S to S and so on, and then later they came to check. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">So the American customs, they opened the valises, they [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And we were staying there in -- where -- where the [indecipherable] then a [indecipherable] a heavy set guy in the -- in the -- in the lumber jacket comes in and he goes around and he ask where 1s it, where are the Saleschutz’s? </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Sa -- so we were very much afraid, maybe -- figured maybe something is wrong, and they would ship us back or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">We didn’t say anything in the beginning and later he said, “Well, their should -- was supposed to be two people with the name Saleschutz,” yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">So my wife was standing there, and she said, “Yes, we are Saleschutz.” </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And “What’s wrong, what’s wrong?” </span><span class="sentence" id="383">We were so afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">So he said, “Nothing is wrong.” </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And he got up to my wife and he kissed her, he got up to me, he said, “You know, I am,” -- and we thought this 1s some official, he said, “I am Yagi, Reisel’s son.” </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Later he became Jake. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">In <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> [indecipherable], “I am Yagi and I find out that you are coming, so I came in here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Now he could go in -- in the -- yeah, right away, when we were standing, and all the people didn’t know what -- what to think. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And he right away called the custom man and the custom came and he didn’t open anything, he just put in a piece of paper on this and he called a longshoreman, and he took the two suitcase we have and put them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And he -- all the people are waiting, they’re waiting, and we were taken out, and they -- they thought, who knows, that probably we are the 30 February 9, 2001 president of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And we ta -- he took us out in the -- right on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> when we took us out, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was waiting and we went in in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and this was -- my brother was waiting 1n the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , they couldn’t park there, but through him they parked. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">So we find out later, and w-we said, this Jack he had -- he

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and he said, “Take it, and get off my back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And when he said to this, naturally I didn’t take the hundred dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Now, the tears filled up my eyes, and I -- I -- I couldn’t -- I couldn’t answer anything, and I couldn’t cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">It was like -- like sometimes you fall down from a -- from a <span class="DLF">ladder</span> and -- and then -- and I was standing there, and -- and the minute I was standing there, when he told me this, and this

</span><span class="sentence" id="539">So I said nothing’s wrong, and I would run out, and I was staying in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> , and I was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I was 27 years old and I was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">A man goes through, and -- and he said, “Hey mister, what’s wrong, what’s wrong?” </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So I said to him, “Are you an American Jew?” </span><span class="sentence" id="543">He said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">So I said, “You know, you should have been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and be killed.” </span><span class="sentence" id="545">To him. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">So he said, “Why you say, why you curse at me there?” </span><span class="sentence" id="547">He says becau -- so I said to him, “Why should my father -- father be killed because he’s a Jew, and you live here, and you have everything.” </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I didn’t know what I am saying, it was a -- so he said, “Hey, why you cursing me?” </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I said, “I don’t know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="550">So he says, “You know what, you ate lunch?” </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">He said, “I want you should come with me, I’m going to eat lunch.” </span><span class="sentence" id="553">So I went with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And I stop crying, and I remember we went into a luncheonette. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And the first time I had this -- and he -- oh, he ask me what do you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I said, “I don’t know, I will have the same thing you have.” </span><span class="sentence" id="557">So I remember he ask [indecipherable] cheese with the -- with the vegetables with radishes, with onions, with -- all chopped up together. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And I liked it so I said I will have the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And I ate, ate, I felt better. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">So he -- so he said, “You want the other one?” </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I said, “No, one 1s enough.” </span><span class="sentence" id="562">He said, “Now tell me, why did you curse me, why did you cry?” </span><span class="sentence" id="563">So I told him the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I told him 41 February 9, 2001 he’s my cousin, and yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">So he said, “It so happens that I am one of his customers.” </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I said you should go -- he said, “You come with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And I want you should hit the son of a bitch in his nose, in his face, but I want to see blood.” </span><span class="sentence" id="568">He said, “Don’t worry, nothing will happen to you, I will be with you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I said you go and this guy deserved -- so I said, “No, I only can tell you one thing, so long as I will be alive, I will never speak to him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="570">He gave me his card, and I remember his name was Louis Siegel, and - and he gave me, he said, “You come and see me when you feel better.” </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And I came to him and he used to buy -- he used to get re -- well, now remnantses. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And he used to see it to people who use like

id="575">Why illegal? </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Because when they send over to a converter material, and when they dyed it, and then after the dyeing, always shrunk maybe one percent, two percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">But he was a partner with the guy from the dyeing and he shrunk five percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">So from each piece he got a piece of six, seven yards. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And he got those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Now, he paid 40 cents a -- a pound, and he sold it for four dollars a pound. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So he said to me, “I’m going to give you every week a case of remnants.” </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And he gave me the address where to sell it. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And he told me how much to s -- for how much to sell it. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And he said to -- to me, “I will charge you what I pay for it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="585">A stranger. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And I went to him, and I did it once, maybe once a week, maybe once a month, how much he told me to give it, and I took those things and I dragged it to the 42 February 9, 2001 place -- to the <span class="BUILDING">wholesale place</span> , and I accumulate nice money. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And he was always happy, he told me, this is what you have to get [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">One day I come into him, he was sitting, he was not sha -- yeah,

QUESTION:  Did you have particular hopes or values that you wanted to instill in your -- in your child, for Esther?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1001">QUESTION:  Hopes and values? </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">Hope of -- the first hopes and values is to -- to install in her a value of Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Not a value of Judaism, about religion, God, but to be proud being a Jew, what the Jews did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">This what I am proud, what the Jews did, fa -- through the 4,000 years since Abraham, what they did to human beings, what they did to the world, including the 10 commandments, including Jesus, even. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">That -- how come that- that -- even with the Catholics, when they believe, said God picked out Mary to have a child, that God is a father, how come she didn’t go to a -- to a Spanish woman, or to a Polish woman, or to a Irish woman and have a child -- if -- 1f I would believe what a Catholic believes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And to have a child with -- with -- with one of those nationality. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">So why did He pick out a Jewish girl, to have a child with a Jewish girl? </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">So probably there is something more to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">Now -- which I don’t believe in all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">Now, I believe in Jesus, far as a human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">Now, he was -- if Jesus wouldn’t be made now, the religion was made 200 years later they started to write. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">If Jesus wouldn’t be made a God, he would be a prophet by the Jews, because he was a -a--a--aman that he tried to help the underdog. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">His friends were fishermen, shepherds, prostitutes, all those things because he wanted to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">He was a very ethical man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And so I believe in this, but I don’t believe that Jesus had anything to do 69 February 9, 2001 with God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">I mean, he was a religious man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">Jesus was a Nazere, a naze -- I don’t know if you know what means a Nazere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">A Nazere means that he didn’t want to have too much pleasure from a life on this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">Like -- like he -- he never cut his hair, he never drink whiskey, he never had a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">Well, those were as people, and Jesus was one of these. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">You -- you cut it off?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1023">QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1024">ANSWER:  Now I -- I don’t know if I told you last time I had a grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">My grandfather was a very, very pious Jew, he was a very learned Jew, he was very well known that he was one of the biggest scholars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">In 1875 he wrote a book, and the book was in -- in- Jesus in -- [indecipherable] means Jesus from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nazareth</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">He wrote it in Hebrew, and this book was never published. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">And I remember we had one manuscript <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , written by hand, beautiful written. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">I would give everything if I would have to take that book, but the book got lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">And he wrote it in -- in this time, a Jew to write about Jesus, it was sacrilegious because the Jew -- the Jews even didn’t want to mention Jesus’s name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">So he wrote about him, and he -- this what he explained. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">He explains that Jesus was born, and he was -- he had a very, very hard childhood because all his friends they used to call him names because he was born out of wedlock. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">So they used to call him -- in Hebrew is mumser. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">Mumser means somebody who was born in -- without a father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">So a -- he was very bitter because he knew that he was born -- his 70 February 9, 2001 mother was not married to je -- to Joseph in this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">But as a human being, he was a wonderful human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">He was very compassionate, as -- but so f -- and he was very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">So to me that the Jews -- this what I try to -- what the Jews gave to -- to the world, now take in -- in our time, the biggest doctors, the biggest thinkers, the biggest musicians, everything is Jewish, I am very proud of it. ’'</span><span class="sentence" id="1039">m very proud of our heritage during all the time of the religion and their history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">But I stop a little when it comes to God, I stop because I have questions, and I don’t know if I believe in God, if I don’t believe in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">I don’t want to think about it, but if I believe, I’m very angry at Him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">Because if -- like they say, if He rolled -- runs the world, and if He rules everything, how -- where was He when they pushed in 4,000 people in a cha -- in a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and the -- the crying and everything, He didn’t hear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">If He didn’t hear it, and He didn’t help, so probably He couldn’t help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">And if He couldn’t help, well who -- who needs Him? </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">So the -- but I -- but this isn’t -- but Esther is more religious that we are, because she doesn’t have this experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">She doesn’t ask God why didn’t He do this, why didn’t He this, why didn’t He help my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">So she is more religious, not the way religious she wi -- not to eat pork, she will eat pork. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">Not to drive on Saturday, she will drive Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">But, as a Jew, she is religious and I told her if she will have children, if the children will go to a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> I pay for it, and I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">For all the 71February 9, 2001 three children, they go to Saloman Schachter, I pay for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">So Iam very, very proud what the Jews accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1052">QUESTION:  Did you talk to her about --about your war experience, about the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1053">ANSWER:  I spoke to her about the Holocaust, but I -- I think -- this what my wife’s opinion 1s, that I -- I spoiled a lot, because I started to talk to her too early. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">I started to speak to her when she was small, and then she was so fed up that she tried to push it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">Even til today, there are organizations from second generations and this, and we told her to join, to be active, she is not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">And this what she said, because she was exposed too early to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">And then later, she tried to push it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">But I -- she knows it from since she was four or five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">And then later when I did with the grandchildren, she told me the same thing, not to try to spoil it, and not to try to influence and talk so much about it when they are too small.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Yeah, well, no, because you see, in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> the money talks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">So they di -- I don’t think so they liked me more, maybe some hated me more, because they were jealous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">So they -- because -- and I give you other example, I had an uncle and his son went here to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , and he hardly made a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">So they came to -- when I moved in in the new <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and -- and I had new -- right away new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , so I told him, well, we try to fix it up, but we not finished yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">I purposely said it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">So she -- so I see she jumped in there to her husband, she says, “See, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">And my son went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and look at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">He just came over here, he has already a beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , he has a 75 February 9, 2001 business, and he is already fixed up.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">Now, they were very, very, very jealous, but they said when they spoke to somebody else, and they said, “Oh Norman is doing all right.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">So they always said, “Oh yeah, we put him on his feet.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">Which they didn’t do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">And there are occasions that -- that -- what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Like for instance, I had one cousin, and they -- he inherited from his father, he had a very big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and they made all kind of children’s underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">So -- and I -- I was in this time in the remnant business, so -- and he had s -- in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> he sold remnants, so I went to him and I said to him, I buy remnants. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">Now h -- and he sold it to a dealer, so he probably charge 50 cents a pound, and later I bought it and I paid four dollars a pound. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">So I said why can’t I buy direct? </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">And he was a cousin, so he said, “Well, I would sell it to you, but you have to bring me a statement from the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">See, we do only business with somebody who could send me a financial statement. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">If you bring me the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> , that you have in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> 25,000 dollars, and [indecipherable] we will do business.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">So I said, “T don’t have 25,000 dollars.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">So I had to buy his remnants and pay instead a half a dollar, I had to pay four dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">And I made a very small profit, which I could make a lot of profit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">Then about 10 years later, when I was already selling <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , I established myself, so this man opened a lot of -- a few <span class="BUILDING">discount houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">So once I went in and I said to him, “You know, in this <span class="BUILDING">discount house</span> you don’t have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">I’m -- I sell furni -- why don’t you give me a call and then I’Il bring in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen sets</span> and 76 February 9, 2001 other things, we can make a lot of money, you will be a partner.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">So -- and I will have- and I could make a big business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">So he said, “Yeah, well it’s a very good idea, but you have to bring me that you have in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> at least hundred thousand dollars, otherwise how could we do business with you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">So I said to him, “You know what?

<p><span class="sentence" id="1343">QUESTION:  Do you think the world has learned from Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1344">ANSWER:  I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">The world has learned that our environment -- when -- when people who are involved learn a -- Jews learned a lot, not so much about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">Let’s say -- let’s talk about Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">The Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> are a little different now to what’s <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">They are closer to the <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> on account of the Holocaust, because they know that we -- would we have <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> before the war, probably more than half of Jews will be alive, because they will run out and they will have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">They didn’t know where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">So now, this is like a insurance policy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">A lot of Jews -- well, the young Jews I don’t think so, because they think we are in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">We have <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in our pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">And it’s not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">So -- but the other people, the elderly people, they figure well, this a insurance policy that in case something happens we have where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">So the whole world didn’t learn anything, because as you can see, we have now not on the -- on the So -- so strong as the Holocaust, we had <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> , we had <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> , we had <span class="COUNTRY">Cambodia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">So there are a lot of <span class="NPIP">places</span> that 1t was repeated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">It was not so repeated like the Holocaust, like I said to you before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">Because it’s not done by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">91 February 9, 2001 Would the Germans be in those <span class="NPIP">places</span> , it will be done completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">But those people were not capable to make it so complete as the Germans, because everything what the Germans did, it had to be perfect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">So they did perfect with the Holocaust also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">So -- but they didn’t learn in case something happened it will be the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">Now, <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> for instance, there are so many nationalities, but we know the time for McCarthy, I don’t know if you remember this, it was almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">But, there were courageous people who stood up, and they started to bring this in the -- t-to the world and they -- and he was thrown out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">But as -- y-y -- also because it was good times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">God forbid if there will be bad times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">They will look for a scapegoat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">They will look for a scapeg -- and here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , the first scapegoat will be the black. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">We have somebody who is behind us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">And the next scapegoat will be a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">There is even a story that a Jew -- somebody said to a Jew that all -- all the disasters are on account of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">Everything, all troubles are the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">So -- so then he said, well give me one example. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">So he said, take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Titanic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Titanic</span> si -- under the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">So he said what you bring the Jews, what have to do ya-ya? </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">He said, well the -- the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Titanic</span> was destroyed by a iceberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">So he said, this what I mean, iceberg, Greenberg, Goldberg, they are all the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">So this 1s -- this is -- the man said it and he believed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">And there is -- and then a other man said about the -- about the Holocaust that all the trouble in the world, all the trouble in the world are on account of the Jews, and account of 92 February 9, 2001 bicycle riders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">Every trouble what’s on the world are -- is guilty the Jew, or the bicycle riders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">And people, when you tell it to them, they look at you and they ask, why bicycle riders? </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">What have bicycle riders to do with the destructions with this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">Nobody’d ask why the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">Nobody said what do have the Jew -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , if there is a disaster, the first scapegoat is the Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">So nobody -- when you tell the story, and I tell the story to a lot of people, nobody ask yet, why the Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">But everybody ask, why the bicycle rider? </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">So there you have the answer, and if you ask -- if it co -- 1f the world learned a lesson, the world didn’t learn no lesson. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">The Jews learned a lesson. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">The Jews who survived learned a lesson. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">I don’t think that the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> learned a lesson. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">There are some Jews who th -- know there was a Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">But the majority Jew, what, they go to W-Wall Street, making money, coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , going -- going to -- to a <span class="BUILDING">nightclub</span> , going to the movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">Do they think about the Holocaust? </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">The Holocaust was done for somebody else, and it was done in a other’s time, and it is not for them.</span></p>
