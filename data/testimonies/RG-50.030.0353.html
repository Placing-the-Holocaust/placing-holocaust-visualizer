<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bivolari</span> was one of the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> established in the late 1800's. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">It consisted of one main <span class="DLF">street</span> , unpaved and a perpendicular one called the <span class="DLF">Armenian Alley</span> , or in Yiddish, the <span class="DLF">Kribbe Gass</span> (ph), at the end of which, the Jewish community of 200 families, approximately a thousand people, built an Israeli, Israelita Romana (ph) or <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , no, <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">The <span class="INT_SPACE">communal bath</span> was there, the <span class="BUILDING">matzo factory</span> , the . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">a few other <span class="BUILDING">institutions</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And we lived happily as children in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , surrounded by about five, six thousand peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">They would come . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">the <span class="DLF">street</span> was one after another, little <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> , ateliers. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> consisted of all sorts of... what do you call them? </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Occupations, there were tailors and cobblers and bakers and other such. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , of which my parents occupied one in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">On Mondays, Sundays and Mondays, the peasants would come with their produce and sell it for such people who would then accumulate it and send it up to other, larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and with the money the peasants would buy what the Jews had for sale. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Previously there were hard times so that when I came on the scene, the atmosphere was relaxed but cautious and nobody ventured out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> by himself or late at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">It was a nice arrangement, we lived during the day, we stay indoors at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And we were not then. . .. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , was bordering, about half a mile from a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prut</span> , and later that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prut</span> became the <span class="DLF">border</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  I want to ask you some more questions.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  You said your parents had a business there, what kind of business?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Dry goods, clothing and behind the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> were <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> , where on many occasions there was an exchange of goods versus produce, that again, was accumulated and sold to a merchandiser.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  Did you have sisters and brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  I was the fifth and the youngest of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Two sisters and two brothers, older, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">We had only the four primary schooling, that <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , primary classes and beyond that we would prepare at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with instructors and travel 40, 50 kilometers to the nearest larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> , to be examined and qualified for higher grades.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  It sounds like the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bivolari</span> was very self-contained?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  So you didn't really, other than <span class="BUILDING">market</span> days...
ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Did you experience any Antisemitism or you... ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Not in the beginning, only as war winds drew closer, that they became more aggressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">At my level, my friends, my age group, that before that they would be just friends, and playmates, but in the late 30's became much more aggressive and inimical.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  So you're saying that you actually had Christians who were playmates?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, because in the back of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we could mingle with the Christian kids and we be ... beyond their <span class="NPIP">place</span> was a large <span class="DLF">field</span> where everybody send their animals to <span class="DLF">pasture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">In addition to all the <span class="BUILDING">establishments</span> I mentioned, the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> of course, we had four, five <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and they were all divided by the occupation, the <span class="BUILDING">tailors synagogue</span> , the cobblers <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and so forth, which probably was a social place of the same kind, and the youth that did not, was not impressed with the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> organized into Zionist movements, of which not the . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">all parents agreed because it meant that it was a preparation for leaving <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">But events caught up with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">In 1939, the Russians and the Germans made an agreement to divide the eastern parts of Europe’ and the Russians moved ' August 23, 1939 <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">USSR</span> sign non-aggression pact in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> , which granted control of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bessarabia</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Charles Messenger, Chronological Atlas of World War Two (New York: Macmillan, 1989) 19. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">up to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">river Prut</span> so that the <span class="DLF">border</span> became half a mile or less from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and because of doubts by the Rumanians, as to our nationalism, they asked the Jews to leave Ro... <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bivolari</span> and concentrate in larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and that's when we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bivolari</span> , with everything that we could take and moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> , 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  You mentioned the Zionist group movements, were you personally involved?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  Absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  And what did that involvement mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  It meant just education and sports activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Preparation for kibbutz life in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and even that we had three or four different outlooks, religious wing and a socialist wing and a right wing and so forth, as Churchill would say, three Jews have four opinions. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">But it was nicely . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">treated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  What motivated you to get involved?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  Motivated? </span><span class="sentence" id="52">My brothers, my sisters were involved in the same organization and by various Hebrew names they belonged to, to more advanced groups, but basically it was educational in the Zionist, in general sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">We had to, all the ones, lecturers and subjects that we could not encounter in any schooling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  Was your family religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">We belonged to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> behind our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but instead of going out through the back Saturday all three, four -- three sons and the father would dress up and walk through the main <span class="DLF">street</span> , about quarter of a mile instead of going right out from the back part of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and walked to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  How much were you aware, before 1939, of Hitler and Nazism and what was going on...
ANSWER: <span class="COUNTRY"> Germany</span> ...
QUESTION:  ... 10 <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Parents knew about it and that's when they softened up in their control of these Zionist organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Such that starting in 1932, one by not too many, one a year maybe, one person, one youngster would leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , to join a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> would walk him to the end of the other <span class="NPIP">place</span> where he would take off on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> or a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> , to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> , from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Constanta</span> , and to there by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  Up until this point, were there any restrictions on Jewish people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bivolari</span> up until '39? </span><span class="sentence" id="63">In terms of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , or business or anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">The Jewish community operated an <span class="BUILDING">abattoir</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">slaughterhouse</span> for kosher food, for kosher meat and poultry and for that and other services paid high taxes that supported the leadership of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and they depended on that so they had to support it, encourage it, all this activities that the Jewish community organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Every family had his own Christian family friends or vice versa. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">A few Christians had one good Jew that they encouraged and they supported.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  So it sounds like you had a fairly nice, comfortable time until 19...
ANSWER:  '39, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  So you packed up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  We packed up and, the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , sat on top and we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And in a few days we found an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on a <span class="DLF">corner street</span> that, a five street corner, very central and my parents and the older brothers immediately went to, back to the same occupation as we left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bivolari</span> , and rented a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and started all over again, in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> good trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I would work in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and also catch up on my schooling that I had to neglect before, and there was the Jewish, larger Jewish community, a larger <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , with all grades up to the 12th grade and there they had special programs for such students that missed the regular grades and we were able to graduate two classes in one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Fifth and sixth, and seventh and eighth, so that by 1944, '43, I finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  Okay now, I'm trying to get a sense of what it felt like to pick up and move and then maybe you can tell me a little bit about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> and how you. . . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">again whether it was self-contained or whether it was part of a larger community, and just how it felt to pick up and leave.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  I have a couple questions, so they were only demanding that the men and boys?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Yes, go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  And who was doing this action, was 1t <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> police only, was it Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  Both. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">The Rumanians were rounding up the people, the Germans were doing the killing, the shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They stopped shooting in the morning and about 11,000 people were still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">They marched them to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and packed them into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and started traveling them from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Podu Iloaiei</span> again and again, back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And every now and then they would pour lime, which give off the fumes that killed of the 12,000 about half or three- quarters of them, died on the pogrom.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="100">My uncle was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Some of our friends were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And the others came out completely disoriented, they didn't know where they were, what they were and it took some doing to find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">In the meantime it quieted down * June 22, 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Hitler launches operation "Barbarossa.” </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Messenger, Atlas of World War Two, 63. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">° Four thousand three hundred and thirty Jews who survived the shooting were loaded into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and of those 2,650 perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">All told, roughly 10,000 Jews were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> on that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, s.v. "</span><span class="sentence" id="109">Iasi." (</span><span class="sentence" id="110">add year) in a few days and my mother and sisters went to look for the brothers because we knew they weren't in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and they weren't in the . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">in that <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">So, when really things quieted down, five days later, our brothers sent somebody <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to notify where they were and mother went and brought them <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  And you and your father were basically hiding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  Throughout this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  Oh, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We had little <span class="DLF">windows</span> where we could look out and see the round-ups. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And my most vivid impression is that a block or two down the <span class="DLF">street</span> , one of the <span class="DLF">streets</span> was a famous <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> and a rabbi and him I saw being dragged, beaten and killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">But then the Germans went on to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and we remained to reorganize. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Now the Rumanians asked all the Jewish families to supply one person for volunteer hard labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">In my family, I was the volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Because in a round-up of such, they ask for a bookkeeper, anybody knows how to keep books. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">My brother raised his hand, but he meant to send me and so I worked as a volunteer on hard, or forced labor in a <span class="BUILDING">military hospital</span> , formerly a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> , but at this time they took it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">In the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> of course, the officer in charge of bookkeeping had difficulties staying sober or keeping books and so he found me, his savior. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">He could pick me out because at this point we had curfew at six, seven o'clock, in evening or early in the morning, so he would come and pick me up, keep me until late hours and take me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  Had you any bookkeeping experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  When I mentioned that in, starting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bivolari</span> , that we had to prepare for exams to be taken in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> , the <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> system of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> you had a choice to pursue engineering or physical sciences or the other, literary and such. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I was in that section of bookkeeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Simple mathematics, except that the officer in charge had to cover up a lot of stealing and losses.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Was there anything frightening about working there, this forced labor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  It was. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">But I wouldn't venture out of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , because most of the wounded were both Romania soldiers and some German. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">As I mentioned at this point, Jewish kids were kicked out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the community had organized it's own <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136"><span class="BUILDING">High school</span> was down the <span class="DLF">street</span> from us and looking back, I could just . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">the incongruity of it that under such circumstances, every Jewish child studied music. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Kept, every day you could see them walk down to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with their instruments. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I studied the violin and it kept us indoors and we had no radio or television or any other entertainment. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">This was something other than book .. . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">books.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  What other restrictions were there at this point in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  Again, they conducted all the, most of the business, most of the commerce in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Again, the peasants that used to bring their produce to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bivolar1</span> would now come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">In fact, the peasantry multiplied because the <span class="DLF">border</span> now was opened to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bessarabia</span> , part of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and they too would bring their goods and their... . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And many of them became merchants themselves, so they would come to us buy wholesale and take it back to the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bivolari</span> , that was now occupied, all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , by some of the peasantry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  So the Jews were allowed to continue business?</span></p>
