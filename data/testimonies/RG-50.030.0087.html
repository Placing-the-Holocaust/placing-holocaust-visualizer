QUESTION:  Okay, Mr. Gruber, you brought us to the point where there were 22 of you, who had gone into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> with the two Polish partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">You told us that the partisans then took your money, your belongings, left, went back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and — never to be seen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">This left you with 21 other men. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Could you tell us about what your thoughts were when you saw yourself there with 22 — 21 other men, facing an unknown situation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="773">ANSWER:  It was a very, very hard situation, we — also we were already on the last few days in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">But still we relied more or less on the Polish two guys, when they came over to the farmers, they helped with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Because the farmers, we knew, didn’t like Jews specifically. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">That’s why I changed my name to Mietek, this is a real Polish — Mieczyslaw and short is Mietek. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And almost every one of our group took a Polish name, that they shouldn’t — also we talked Yiddish between ourself and we, we were a Jewish group, almost everybody knew, but we didn’t want to be so obvious in dealings with the farmers to say that Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And they always had that imagination that a Jews is not a soldier, a Jew doesn’t know what a rifle is, a Jew doesn’t — he’s different than all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">The difference what meant a lot, that they, they — some of them they didn’t see a Jew, but they told them the story about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Then, this reminds me when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">One day they took me to a farmer to work in the <span class="DLF">farm</span> and when they came time to lunch they took me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I was sitting by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and there was a young girl, a German girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And I was talking fluently German, I spoke to her, and she spoke to me, and I saw she likes me, she’s talks to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Then she starts talking about Jews, “Because of the Jews the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">Because of the Jews the — this, this, this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="785">I asked her a plain question, “Did you ever saw a Jew?” </span><span class="sentence" id="786">She said, “No, I never saw.” </span><span class="sentence" id="787">I said, “How you know what it 1s?” </span><span class="sentence" id="788">She said “Hitler said that they are killer, that they are this, this, this. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And they have horns,” she said, “they have horns. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Jews have horns.” </span><span class="sentence" id="791">I said, “Listen darling, I am a Jews and I have no horns.” </span><span class="sentence" id="792">She almost died. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I couldn't believe it, what kind of faces she made then and she — she ran out from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and she was so excited and so this — and she came back and said, "You are lying to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">That's impossible," she said. “</span><span class="sentence" id="795">You couldn't be it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="796">I was a good looking young fellow in a uniform and she couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And that was the, the image of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">It was only — they didn't know even, who a Jew is. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">But the image of a Jew was, for them, something that — terrific, was with horns or some devil or something a Jew is not a normal person. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">That is what they —
QUESTION:  That's a interesting story. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">We will get to that later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="802">ANSWER:  That's why I came to the farmers when we came. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">The Pollacks helped us out and they, they were the front, and now we had to be the front and I was the front always because I spoke very good Polish and I always came in and like I told before, I was introducing myself and I told them why I was here. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Then, when we exhausted the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , we started moving away from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">But before we moved, we had a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">We had a boy with us from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> , and this boy run away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> in a special way. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">He jumped in — they took out the, the — I don't know how to tell it in English, from the, from the horses, the, the—
QUESTION:  Manure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="808">ANSWER:  Manure. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And he jumped in into this. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And the farmer didn't see him and he was almost choked to death there but he — he came out from there with a horse manure from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="811">It was almost impossible to get out from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">He came out from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And somehow the Pollacks from the Underground, they brought him over to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And he got typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">He became sick in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="816">We put him in, in our — 1n a <span class="DLF">hole</span> somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">They covered him up because it was cold already in October. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And we kept him like this and from himself, he got better and we were waiting for him to get better. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">In meantime, we were 22 people, and three of our people said, "That's enough.” </span><span class="sentence" id="820">They don't want to go run like this. “</span><span class="sentence" id="821">It is no use. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">They will kill all of us, and it's very hard life. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I'd rather go in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where I have a soup and they gave me some work to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">The Germans will not kill.” </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And three of our people went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="826">QUESTION:  How do you feel about their leaving?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="827">ANSWER:  It was a terrible shock to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I couldn't believe it because we went through so much by running away, and they jeopardized other people and all this, and they, they knew about this, but you can't judge people. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">You don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">Everybody has his own mind, and it was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">The beginning was so hard it's unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">I was really scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I didn't know where I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">When I came in, I saw the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="835">It, it was a special wind blowing from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> with a noise, the Pollack said, "Here, this will be your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> now.” </span><span class="sentence" id="836">To walk in into this, and it was dark when we walked in into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , it was — the animals were making a lot of noise and it — and I came from a, from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , nothing — a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and it was scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And one of them <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> was something broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">It made so much noise that we didn't know that it was a wounded animal or something like that or a human being or something and one of our people jumped up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> and he cut it off and he showed that was only a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> making the noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">But we were really scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">We didn't know what, what to expect there. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">You don't know where you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">In fact, we really didn't know where we were because not far from us maybe a mile or two, were Germans living. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">There they had a <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="844">They lived there, and they were watching their <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="845">There was there a big one. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">But we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">We didn't know for nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">We were just came in there and, and we were doing our job, going every night and back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And it's good that we decided to go away because the farmers start talking and the Germans would find out fast, and they would kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Then we went away and after a night, or two nights— I don't remember exactly how it was — by walking from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other, only by map. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Only by a compass and a map. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">We didn't ask nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">In the night all of a sudden we hear noises in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and we stopped, and start looking, what kind of noises, voices. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">We heard something like Yiddish, spoken and I said, "This is something.” </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And we over near one or two of us, the rest was standing on the side, and we start screaming, "amkha'*." </span><span class="sentence" id="856">Means “your people.” </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And right away from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> answered voice, "amkha.” </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And to our amazing we found a whole group of people who had run away from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="859">This was maybe — they called a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Markuszow</span> , what they called it, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village Markuszow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="860">The whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of there was maybe 100 people or whatever run away from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And they all came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And there were ladies and men and children, a camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And between them were two Russian prisoners of war who had run away also from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> from a prisoners of war camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">They run away from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="865">They run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">One was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolka</span> — one was Mikoi— Tolka, Tolka, and Mikoi, was the two men there. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">One was a officer and the other was a sergeant or something from the Russian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And when they saw us— we came in uniforms, we were all in uniforms from the prisoner of war — oh, he got so excited and he — they took us over and he start talking and we looked around and we saw they were building <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="869">You know what a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> is? </span><span class="sentence" id="870">They were building in the <span class="REGION">land</span> — they were building some <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> there, and they put up <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> or grass. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">They covered everything and they were living down in this <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="872">QUESTION:  Why don't you take a minute and tell us about what these <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> really did look like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="873">ANSWER:  They are <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> was interesting this. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">I, I can't shake it from me because I hated the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> , as to me it looked like a <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="875">You go in a <span class="DLF">graveyard</span> right there, cause they had a <span class="DLF">door</span> in the front where you walked in from the side, and the top it was like grass. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">You didn't see nothing on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">It was <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> there around and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and everything and dug. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">They dig into the, into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="879">QUESTION:  How far down did they go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="880">ANSWER:  Far. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">There was for a 20 people here. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">And one, one <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> was for 40 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">Far, big and it was two <span class="DLF">entrances</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="884">One for them to walk in and one to walk out. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Far away to walk out. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Took a long, long time and when they built, they built 1t open you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Then they take <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="888">They put on top and they covered it. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And when it was raining, rain came in — still not all the way, but 1t came in still someway. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">When I saw this, I said, "No, not for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I didn't come in here to, to, to lay in — then the Germans will come in, and it's very easy to get all of us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="892">And I said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I will not stay here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And I told this Tolka and said, "It's not for me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="895">He said, "If you want to stay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="896">He said, "I have children and I have women. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">I have people. </span><span class="sentence"

around you and we will work with you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="901">But then he says, "Please, give me somebody what is a soldier and discipline he knows because all of them come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and they're children and they don't know what army is, what soldiers is, what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">Give me a few people of yours.” </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And they will '8 Your people (Hebrew) teach, start learning them the skill of the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And I said, "Okay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And I left Jegier, Cygan, I remember the name, and the woman Gottlieb(ph) her name, three or four I left with Tolka. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And they were, they were starting working with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">I went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">But we kept contact all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">We — through other farmers — how it happened, Tolka had already connections. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">He came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Garbow</span> and in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">His name was Kaminski, Genek Kaminski. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">This was a known and this Genek was something what we have to thank a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">He was — I think he was a communist before he war or at least a socialist, I don't know what — and he belonged to a group of people and he had some people there working against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And this Tolka brought me over to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">He introduced me to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And we start working from this, this was our like <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="917">This Tolka had connections with the real partisans — not partisans special, but with the heads of the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">He had connections with the A.L.'’. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">This was army in Armia Ludowa. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">There was a Gomulka”’ and there was a Moczar’', and there was Zymierski”” and there were all the heads of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> which were later on the Polish government, and he had some connections with these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And little by little he almost gave his orders, instead of them, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">But we lost — we became appointed with Genek. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">In the nights we came to him, and he was taking care of us now. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">He was sending us out for special work. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">He told us which farmers have rifles or ammunition or something and he said, "Go to this farmer and tell him he should give you a rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">If he doesn't, you do whatever you feel like because he has it.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">And with the help —
QUESTION:  When you say, you did — could you describe one such action?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="929">ANSWER:  We came, we came — first of all, we needed always help now from this Markuszow people. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">We were in touch with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">They had Jegier with them and he was teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And we were taking out some of them people like Sever Rubinstein and others, and they were going with us also. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">First of all, they knew the terrain. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">They know where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And we were strangers. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">We were not from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , and this was very, very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">They knew every piece, every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , every farmer, every — they, they knew everything around there, and it was very, very helpful for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">Especially was one of them guys a young fellow was Franek Bleichman. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">He came from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="940">We met also. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">He wasn't from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> from— what's name — Markuszow. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">He was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamionka</span> , a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And he came out with a small group of his people, of Jewish people— young, youngsters. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">He was maybe 18, 19 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">He wasn't a army man too, but he was very shrewd and he was — he knew the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="946">His father, I think, was dealing with farmers or something and he was taking him with him, and he knew around the '9 Armia Ludowa 0 Wladyslaw Gomulka *1 Mieczyslaw “Mietek” Moczar *2 Michal “Rola” Zymierski neighborhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">And this Bleichman became very handy to us and he was always helping us, going when we needed in the night for a — certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">Because this Tolka — no, Genek Kaminski, he gave us orders now already. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">He told us, "Go in this and this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and there is — a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going through.” </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And we took axes and very primitive things, shovels and all this, and take away a piece of rail, of rail. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> will come. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">It will fell off from this. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">And the first action was — the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was right in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And we came off — I remember I had a very strong man. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Zelazny” was his name, zelazny~* means iron. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">And we called him “Zelazny,” because he was so strong, and he, he ripped out with those — almost with his hand, he ripped out a piece of the rail and but we still — he ripped it out but it was staying still. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">He didn't — he didn't take it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">And with axes, we were working there for hours until we heard a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> coming, and we stay away and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">It stopped there because when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> saw that something was missing or something later, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">But it disrupt already maybe a whole night and a whole day the communication because they, they were dragging who knows what — some ammunition to the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">It was on the way from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="963">This, this was the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And we disrupted already this. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">Its — but we couldn't stay there too long, because we were afraid and we came back and we told this Tolka, reported to him that we did this and this. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">He was very happy, and this gave us some kind of a lift. “</span><span class="sentence" id="967">Oh, we can do things!” </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Then he sent us out on the <span class="DLF">highways</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="969">We put up a metal string to the <span class="DLF">highways</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="970">When a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> came, it had to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">We stopped them and we were on the sides waiting for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">We had a few rifles already from the farmers what we took. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">But interesting was this. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">One of our man — his name was Finkel’? — </span><span class="sentence" id="975">went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where I was working and there was another <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> too, and there were rifles and there were pistols and they were — what's the name — other things, what do you need? </span><span class="sentence" id="976">Coats, because when I ran out I couldn't take nothing with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">It was still warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">Nobody has a — nobody had a coat with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">It was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">It start to be cold, so we were shivering cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">And we sent out this Finkel. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">He did — didn't look like a Jew completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">He was looking like a Pollack. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">And he went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and he organized there another 20 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">But this time they took a German and they told him — they were dealing with him, like I told you, the Jews were help — dealing with them Germans there. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">They told him, "You see and look. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">Don't say nothing.” </span><span class="sentence" id="988">And they put on the rifles and uniforms and what's the name — covers and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> spreads and all kinds of things, a full <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and he was dealing with them before — robbing them to sell things, but he didn't know what is going on and we had — Finkel knew where we will be there in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="989">He made a an appointment with him, and he brought over the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with maybe about 20 rifles. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">New ones, German ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">Completely new ones! </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And he brought it over to us on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">The German, that was one of the guy who was the leader from the Dworecki was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">He said to the German, "You go back and shut up. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Don't say one word, you know us. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">You saw nothing, 3 “Zelazny” Eisenberg 74 Tron (Polish) *° Stefan Finkel because they will kill you, or we will kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">Then just don't say nothing.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="998">No, I will not say nothing," and let him go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="999">QUESTION:  That's an incredible story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">How, in fact, did Finkel arrange to—
ANSWER:  Finkel went back too, because he knew the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">He was living there before, and he knew how to get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">And he walked into the people there in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there and he contacted himself with this group, and the people Dworecki was there like a Mikoi the whole group, about 20 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">And he talked to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">He was there two, three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">We knew what is it — we will be like this two, three days and we had a appointment with him to come back on this and this <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">And he — they knew — he knew that they are dealing with this German too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">He knew always, of course, because he was dealing with this German, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">And they took out whatever they wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1009">QUESTION:  But to deal, you needed money?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1010">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">You needed money if you would buy it, but they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">They told them — they took out a pistol from the — and they said to this German, "You go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">No money for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">You just thank God for your life and get back and don't say nothing to nobody.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">And he went back and we had the rifles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">I received — I remember a German coat I put on and a hat — the German I put on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1017">QUESTION:  How did you feel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1018">ANSWER:  And I felt, I felt in two ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">First of all, I got warmer because it was very, very cold, but I felt very bad that I have to wear a uniform from a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">That was always inconceivable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">This was something what — goodness! </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">But we felt proud for the whole situation what we did because this was nobody could accomplish a thing like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">This was a big accomplishment to bring 20 rifles, new ones, on the spot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1024">QUESTION:  Now, you had a small army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1025">ANSWER:  We had a small army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">We had already this and we told this Tolka all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">We told them what we have now and what is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">Everybody was happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">We start doing real work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">We start going out for the Germans on the <span class="DLF">highways</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">Then we start the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">Every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had a <span class="BUILDING">town house</span> , and in this <span class="BUILDING">town house</span> they were registering everybody and when you were registering the people, the Germans were using it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">One second, I have to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">The Germans registered almost every young Pollack. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">They registered even the Jews, whatever the registration in the — in the <span class="BUILDING">town house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">We got our order to recover this, to fight and to burn it out, ruin it that they shouldn't have the registrations from the people there because they took it away to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">They took it away to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">They have a register. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">They came up <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and they took up the kids and we start burning up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">Every <span class="BUILDING">town house</span> there, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Markuszow</span> was the first we knew where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">We always used the people what were from there from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , say from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Markuszow</span> say from ” ¢ and other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> where they have — we had the people what run away from them <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">And they were together with us then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1043">QUESTION:  But now, how was it possible for you and your small army to burn down a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1044">ANSWER:  It was, 1t was very easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">We took some straw and we threw in straw and made a fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1046">QUESTION:  Nobody saw you enter?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1047">ANSWER:  They saw, and they didn't say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">Some people — the Pollacks they saw, they were afraid of us because we came with rifles and then they — it was night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">Always in the night we were doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">And we were burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">It was very, very easy for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">We would — except once we had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Markuszow</span> we had some going over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">The Germans were there, and — but before, before we came in the Germans were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">And by accident, they saw our people and we had to fight with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">And we still burned down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">It was a whole story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">Is a very long story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">And we still burned down the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">But we had losses there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">One was killed, and one was Zelazny the strongest guy what we had had still today, still today had a piece of iron from the bullet was in him, staying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">Didn't come out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1062">QUESTION:  During this action as you described, what was your responsibility?</span></p>

QUESTION:  How did you know that the priest gave this sermon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1190">ANSWER:  Oh, the Pollack, they told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">The farmer's group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">When I went to the farmers, I came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because I repeat the <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">When I went over to a farmer and he was nice to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">You know, the farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">Because some of them, they were not too nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">They just gave us what we wanted and get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">Some of them were really nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">They kept us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">They told us to stay with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">Then we came to them back, and they told us what is going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">They told me the priests spoke like this, and the priest told them and knew he told them also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">He said, "Why do you have to go to call the Germans? </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">The Germans are far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">They don't know what is going — coming in the, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">If you told them, they know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">And this made a big difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">Big, because people stop, stopped bothering us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">They stopped, except they let us go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">We came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">We did our work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">We did never, never abuse them people because there were groups like robbers or something people came in they run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">They were on the German's hands or whatever, and they formed also, not partisans groups — bandits from this, and they came in usually and they took away whatever the farmer had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">But we came in like gentlemen you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">We came in with a speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">I said — I told them, “We're fighting for freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">We don't want nothing from you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">We just want to eat something and we want to relax or to sleep a few hours.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">And this one farmer told the other, and they knew what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">Now —
QUESTION:  Were your — did your group have it's own identify?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1221">ANSWER:  “The Mietek,” “the Mietek Grupa”°,” “Group of Mietek,” “the Group of Mietek.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">The group — lots of things later on: “The Group of Jegier,” names the people knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1223">QUESTION:  This was your group.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1224">ANSWER:  My group, “Mietek.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">Everybody knew about it and they knew — the farmers knew about me, and they knew about this recommend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">In fact, there was a, a landowner, very rich one, and he always gave us money when we came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">And he gave us a cow or whatever, whatever we wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">Horses we needed to go from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">He always gave us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">Then he gave it when I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">If the group came in without me, he wouldn't give. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">He wouldn't give. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">Nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1234">QUESTION:  Why was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1235">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">He had a mind something, and I think he was right after this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">After the war, this landowner was arrested for helping the Germans like because he had Germans there also in the <span class="BUILDING">landowners house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">And he called me as a witness that I should tell the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> how he helped, how he gave money you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">And he said, said “I didn't gave no money to nobody, only you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">You should be the witness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">You should know about it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">And he used it after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">He gave money only to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">We used the money for all kinds of things we gave the farmers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1245">QUESTION:  How, how much time had you spent in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> with your group of men before you reached the point where you were confident about your leadership?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1246">ANSWER:  It took time to be 100 percent confident in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">It was very, very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">I will tell you straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">With Jewish people, it is very, very hard to be a leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">Every one of our Jewish people were a leader himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">They knew a lot you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">They are not dummies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">Everyone of them, and to be a leader by Jews, you really have to have guts and you have to have patience and you have to have — I don't know what — to be a leader, but this is no jokes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">This is I tell you at this — what's the Ben-Gurion?’ </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">said it was, “I am a president of million presidents.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">And that was very, very hard for Jewish people this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">But there was a necessity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">I have the upper hand because I spoke fluent Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">When I came to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> or 6 Group (Yiddish) 7 David Ben-Gurion something I had — I had to speak because most of them spoke Yiddish and the language was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">Only <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szengut</span> was the guy what — but he looked so Jewish and so Yiddish he couldn't, he couldn't represent us you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">It was — we had to push him a little bit on the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">Now, we established our presence in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , but we felt we couldn't stay too long in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">They told us not to stay, and we didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">We felt — because we exhausted — I came twice — three times to the same farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">He didn't have what to eat himself to watch this, and we had to go farther. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">Then I decided to go with the group of 10 people to find out — because they were talking about other groups on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bug</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">We were — there was — when you see the map, there was a, a — this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wieprz</span> , is the name — <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wieprz</span> and the next was the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bug</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bug</span> was the <span class="DLF">border</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> already later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">But we were between the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wieprz</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bug</span> later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">In the beginning, we were on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wieprz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">We had to cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">And we crossed over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wieprz</span> and we knew that between the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wieprz</span> and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bug</span> 1s a group — 1s groups, partisans there that we heard about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">You know they told us, the farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">There was no telephones, but we heard that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">We had connections all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">This Genek, his connections was saving us always. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">We knew when the Germans going out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> with a expedition of something, we knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">They told us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">The farmers, one told the other and they told us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">We had the connections. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">We had this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">And only with connections we could live through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">We were laughing already there when I was going sometimes in the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">I laughed and said what group 1s going again that meetings to get a connection then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">I felt that is the way to be because when you are a group, you live by yourself, and you don't know — no telephones, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">You don't know what's going to come next, and they were spying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">You have to have this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">You have to know what your neighbor's doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">You have to know what's going on, and you have to know the other groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">You have to know what's in the, what's going on in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">We knew about politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">We knew everything was in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">This in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">This we knew everything what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">I was reading papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">I was seeing everything clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">Otherwise, we couldn't live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">It was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">Of course, a lot of groups were — a lot of Jews run away, and they didn't have the organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">They didn't have the connections and they disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">They disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">The Pollacks killed them themselves or somehow the Germans — they told the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">They disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">Disappeared group by group disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">And I went through this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wieprz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">There was a whole story how we went through that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">And we came over on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and I was so tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">Unbelievably tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">And I was sorry that I brought them people on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> because we were walking two days and two nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">We didn't know where we are going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">Completely! </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">We were — like I say, I didn't have the connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">I didn't have the people around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> there I knew already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">I knew where I'm going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">And here I didn't know nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">And we walked over to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and we woke up a woman there and she start screaming and crying, "Please don't do this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">I said, "Don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">We will not do nothing to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">Just let us in.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">She said, "No, I can't because I have a child 1s sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">Very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">He had typhus or something and you will catch it too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">Don't go in.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">Said, "Okay, we will go in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">We went in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">We were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">We were so tired of walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">I think it will start snowing or something later and there was a real night, I felt half, half dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">And I lay down in the, the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and all our people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">We always kept one men to watch and all of a sudden maybe it was day already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">I wake up and I see nobody's watching. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">Nobody! </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">I woke up, and I was a very sleeper — I, I could hear everything always when sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">I don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">This was nature or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">I could hear everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">Whatever happened in sleep always, I could hear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">Then I walked over — I woked up, I went over to the <span class="DLF">door</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and I see, all of a sudden, I see Germans, Polish uniforms, the police, and farmers and the whole posse but still forming, still going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">And I woke up my people very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">And we walked out with the front and shooting at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">They were not still organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">They were still starting something then, and we start shooting at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">And walked around the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , and we start running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">Because they were an army there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">Who knows how many? </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">And we start running, running and we — I see very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">There's no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">We are only a few <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> there, and it is a <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">They have a good <span class="DLF">field</span> for us to shoot us when we running. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">They can shoot everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">And little by little we start moving away, moving away and all of a sudden, I see one guy fall beside and then I see another one fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">They were not dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">Just one was shot in the foot, and one was somewhere else shot and he said, "Please take my rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">I am dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">They will kill me anyway.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">I said, "I don't need your rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">I have mine.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">I couldn't do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">Then all of a sudden I feel a shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">It was my finger here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">I have still the finger here like this, shot here right here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">I squeezed my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">I see blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">Yes, I took out, I don't know, a handkerchief or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">I put it on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">I didn't make a big deal of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">I was walking, walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">All of a sudden I feel a shot in my foot, in my leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">Yeah, right here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">Through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">And I cannot walk no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">I cannot walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">I was trying you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">Szengut right behind me, and he start pulling me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">He said, "You have to walk.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">In the meantime, the rest of the people — we were about 10 or 12 — start moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">You know, they cannot wait for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">They see this one 1s laying, another is laying, and he, he didn't leave me alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">He starts pulling me, and I start walking and walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">I see I still can walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">The bone wasn't touched. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">And this was luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">It was just the meat here that was shot here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">And I could walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">It was bleeding a little bit, but I still walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">And we run over to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there and we told the farmer, "Fast put on a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> ,’ Szengut said, “and we will put on — I will put you down on this on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and we will start running away with this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">Then all of a sudden I see the Germans right by the <span class="DLF">border</span> there when I was, I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">They came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">And one starts talking Polish to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">And he says in Polish, "You're a Jew, bastard?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">or something, this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">And he aimed with a rifle this, and he didn't, I don't know, he didn't hit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">I got up and Szengut grabbed me and left the horse with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , and I start screaming with my people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">I start screaming with my people, they rest, "Stop and start shooting back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">Start shooting back because otherwise nobody will live.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">And I remember like today this one of them guys, it was Andrejew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">He was the first one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">He turned around, took out the rifle, he was aiming at the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">The Germans stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">They stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">Right away they fell through the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">And when he took out a few of our people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">There was a Finkel there was a few four or five. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">They took out the rifles and they start shooting back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">When they stopped the Germans, I had time to with Szengut to run away to come over and we went over to a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> somewhere there around not far, and the Germans stopped a little bit behind and they had three of our people and I think they, they killed there because I know — don't know what happened to them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">And between them was this Majdanek, this guy what run away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">He was killed there right away in this skirmish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">And I run away to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">In the meantime, Szengut and another one, Finkel, they both went back to look. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">Maybe they can help somebody to — they came to a <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> and they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> there, and when they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> Germans was sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">A whole bunch of them was sitting there, and they were singing or eating something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">You know they, they had that trophy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">They took away — I think they took away some money from these three guys too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">They had maybe a few — I don't know what kind money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">And Finkel closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> and Szengut had hand grenade and they threw in there the hand grenade into this, and they don't know what happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">Then they run away, and they found me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">I was still waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">And we took a farmer, stopped with a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> on this — put me on this and they sat down and I was with Szengut and another one and they had another — they stopped other farmers when they — on the way and we start moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">And on the way I asked the farmer, "Maybe you will take me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because I am shot and I cannot — my finger start bothering me very much, more than the foot.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">I said, "I cannot walk and I cannot, I cannot function.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">He said, "You have to be helped.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">I said, "Oh no, my wife is sick and there's a — I'm afraid, but I will bring you over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">I have a <span class="DLF">farm</span> and I have a man what works for me, and he will keep you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">He will keep you there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">I said, "Alright, whatever he wanted to do.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">And he brought me over to another farmer and the farmer was very nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">They, they took a Band-Aid and they, they took some water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">I don't know what kind of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">They washed it and they cleaned it very, very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">They, they helped me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">It took almost a half a day, something, I was there sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">All of a sudden, shooting again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">I was with Szengut, and another Piasecki was another guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">We were there in the <span class="DLF">partition</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">The rest of the group was in another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">Start shooting in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">Like a thunder. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">Shoot directly in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">And the farmer showed me the way out in the back and me and Piasecki. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">I got up and I said, "Where is Henryk?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">I said, "Where is Finkel?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">And I start looking back and I don't see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">And the farmer said, "You cannot wait a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">Run. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">Run.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">And from the back of the <span class="DLF">farm</span> it was already start to be a little darkish and I run away with Piasecki, this guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">We run away both of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">And with my wounded foot then I had to walk a whole night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">I was walking in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">Walking, walking, walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">It was day almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">I went over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">I had no, no choice already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">I didn't know what to do myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">I walked over to a farmer. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1458">You should help me something or give me a piece of bread or something.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">And I came over to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">The farmer boy standing there came out and said, "God, what are you doing here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">He said, "The Germans were here last night here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">And they killed one of your people," he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">And I figure out that that was Szengut. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1464">One of you people was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">And they took off even his boots they took off because he wore new boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">He said, "They took off his boots and they took him away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">And you are here! </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">How does it happen?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">I walked a whole night in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and I came back to the same <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">You know in the night, you don't know where you're going and there's a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">You don't know it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">I came back to this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">Then in the day time, what I found out, the Germans are still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">They said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">They went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">But they still come back or whatever.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">They said, “They knew that the partisans here, the group 1s here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">I said, "I have no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">In the daytime with this Piasecki, we were both of us we start moving back from where I came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">I came back and I came over to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wieprz</span> , to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">There's a big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and you stay here a night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">Cannot walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">Then all of a sudden came in a bunch, a bunch of Polish kids from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">They went there and they start screaming, "Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">Jew.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">I was so disgusted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">At least I had something in my hand like glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">I will throw this as a bomb I said, “if you don't go away, if you don't stop this screaming. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1490">They shut up and then came in a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">I don't know, it looked like a school teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">He was dressed up nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">He said, "What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">You are — you have a problem here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">I said —I said, "Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">I want to go through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wieprz</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">I said, "How can I go?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">He said, "Don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">I will show you where.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">He brought me over to a small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there, and there 1t was a guy with his — he had this — a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and he was bringing over people on other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">That was his — he said, "You have money?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">Said, "No, I don't have no money, but I have a lighter.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">I remember a very nice lighter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">I had it from Kaganowicz, I forgot to tell the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">Kaganowicz was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">And I took away a watch and some lighter and I think he had some money, and I took it away from him, and I had it with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">And this lighter I took out. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1508">Show me it works.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">I showed him it works. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1510">Okay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">For this lighter, he took me over on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> with Piasecki. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">We came over to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">The other <span class="NPIP">side</span> I knew already where farmers are and this I came over and I see a light, some a farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">I see a light. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">I say I was afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">You know this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">I start looking near this and I came over and see the rest of my people are there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">And they went — the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wieprz</span> , then they came back to this farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">They knew also the farmer from before because we knew when we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">We met and they said, "Oh, you still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">Somebody said that you are killed.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">They didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">Szengut was killed because they said somebody was wounded and he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">They knew already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">Oh, they was so happy that I am alive, that — and I went back with this group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">I remained maybe a day or something like a whole day without them too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">They went for food or something and I was staying with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">It was also very, very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">I was feeling very bad, but they left me and they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">But they came for me, and we went together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">We went back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that we knew before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">And they came over to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> where I told them <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> , and this Tolka had a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> there before, before with his Markuszow people and Jegier and all those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">And I came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">There's nobody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">They disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">And all of a sudden came over a —a father and daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">Said, "No, Tolka is no more here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">He's somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">They built another <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> because he was afraid to stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">He built for 40 people, he built a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">I said, "Can I meet him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">The guy said, "Wait, maybe he has to come in here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">Tolka has to come in here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">I said, "Alright.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">And it didn't take long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">This Tolka came over with Nam— with somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">They said, "Look. </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">Look here, I am wounded,” and they said, "I haven't got where to take you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">It's full there."

<p><span class="sentence" id="1600">QUESTION:  Code.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1601">ANSWER:  Code. </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">And we called out "Amkha," and they answered "Amkha.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1603">We said, "Who is this?" “</span><span class="sentence" id="1604">Jegier.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">Jegier with a group of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1606">Of course, it was Rubinstein, there — Sever — and other people.
