QUESTION:  Would you talk about your parents and your grandparents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I only knew my maternal grandparents and they were gentle people but I also, they were a bit forbidding. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">They didn’t have a great way with children.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  And what about your father and his parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  My father’s father was Jewish but in those days you were German first and then whatever religion you were. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He happened to fall in love with a Christian girl and switched religions in order to be able to marry her. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">He became a Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  Yeah, in order to be able to marry her because of her parents or—
ANSWER:  Now this is something I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">This was quite a long time ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">https://collections.ushmm.org
QUESTION:  But you were just told that he could not marry her unless he converted but you don’t know why.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  I don’t know whether it was a must situation or whether it was just something he chose to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Probably her parents might have objected but I don’t know any of those circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  So your father was raised Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Although secularly really. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Observing the major holidays but nothing much in between.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  And what kinds of stories did he tell you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  Well I mean the history of the fact that he never knew his mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Only after she died, he heard some aunt saying the poor boy and that was actually his first memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">He does not remember his mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">She was the Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And his father, he was extremely close to, very, very, he loved him and honored and respected him. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">In fact all during my childhood not, not a day would pass that he wouldn’t mention his papa. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">In one nice way or another.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  So you had an idea of him, even though you didn’t know him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Oh I saw photos of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">A very, a man, with very big eyes and worried looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">He had been widowed so very early and was never remarried you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">https://collections.ushmm.org

ANSWER:  Well. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">My parents were not church goers or temple goers as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">My mother sometimes with friends might go to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> for high holy days, Jewish high holy days. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">But other than that she never did and my father simply was not a church goer, although he was a very religious man. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">When I was a teenager I spoke to him once and he didn’t answer me, didn’t answer me. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And after about five minutes, he looked at me and he said I’m sorry I didn’t answer you, I was praying. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">That was his religion and it was very deep. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But he was not a church goer. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But he accomplished miracles as you will later find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And I’m sure it had something to do with his relationship he had with the higher being.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  And were you baptized?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  I was actually baptized. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And you know I was young child. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">No, no I mean I wasn’t a toddler or an infant. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I was already, I can’t remember how old I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Maybe five, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And they decided that I should be baptized. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And we went to Pastor Neemuler’s <span class="BUILDING">church</span> but he was not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Someone else baptized me but with water from https://collections.ushmm.org the Rubes spray in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And I remember we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from that and my mother had a close Jewish girlfriend who heartily disapproved. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">She thought it was just terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And she told them that. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">But then she invited them in for coffee and cake to celebrate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  So this would have been in 1933 about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  Probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Or a little later. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I don’t know whether I was, I cannot remember what age I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I might have been older than, probably they might have done it a little later when things were beginning to look really bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">33 was still fairly early, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I wasn’t aware of what was really happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  But some persecution had started in 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  Yes and you know you have these roving bands of Brown Shirts, singing anti-Semitic songs and torch parades. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">A little bit awesome and scary, that sort of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  So you had a baptismal certificate?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  If I ever had one, I don’t think I ever saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Honestly. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">My mother must, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I just, ve never seen it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  What did the teacher do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  Oh it was just her sharpness and her nastiness. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I don’t remember details. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Very quick to slap faces, things like that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  You know that is vague to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I don’t really remember any particular Jewish, none of us children really paid attention to our different religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We were just kids together. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And I to this day I could not tell you who was Jewish and who wasn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I think there probably were more non-Jewish children in that class. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">There may have been a handful besides myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Did you think of yourself as Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  I always thought of my, thanks to the Nazis, I thought of myself as three-fourths Jewish and one-fourth Christian.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I remember going to this <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> which was in a nice <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> there, called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rosentav</span> , which means valley of roses. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And not really now wait a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">That may not have been there. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">But the lady, my mother’s best friend whom I stayed with for a while, she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rosentav</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I remember having to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> in the mornings to get to the https://collections.ushmm.org school. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I can’t tell you to this day where it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">But it was a very nice <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and everyone there was Jewish and they were all new faces to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  Was the curriculum very different from the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  The one big difference was that I had to learn Hebrew, which was very difficult and of course, I never really learned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I just learned some of the symbols and how to pronounce them and how to read them. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">But you know that time period could not have lasted very long because I didn’t do that very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And it was must be shortly thereafter that we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">That means in other words, that I didn’t leave the <span class="BUILDING">German public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Well I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 39. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Probably 38.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  This is your father. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">https://collections.ushmm.org
ANSWER:  My father. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Sorry, my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And he just couldn’t believe that this madness could stay and they would be talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">There was a current joke that went around in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> that it ended with the Jews and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicyclists</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And the question would be why the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicyclists</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And then the answer would be why the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And that time it was one of the current jokes. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">It sounds better in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And let me see what else. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">It was just a general feeling of, I don’t know, something dark surrounding us. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And of course, shall I go on about when my father left or do you want to ask me that later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  Well before we get to that, what was your father’s occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">He had his own <span class="BUILDING">export import firm</span> and then he hired a new secretary and this was my mother to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And, they, she was his secretary for about four years and it was a one man company. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And of course no, he had people that worked for him but they were salesmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">It was export import and it was doing quite nicely.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="219">QUESTION:  Now was the business folding, was that a result of persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  I believe so. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I think it was the economic climate. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I don’t know if it was a depression that had touched <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">As well. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I’m not clear about the economic reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I just know that before I was born, or while I was still an infant this business was no longer supporting him.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  She took on a job as a housekeeper for a very nice well-to-do Jewish family and it was really nice because there was a young woman there who she became very good friends with. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And her grandfather, the young woman’s grandfather and her mother who https://collections.ushmm.org seemed to be a little bit retarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Some kind of emotional problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Her grandfather was a marvelous old gentleman and they sort of adopted me as the child of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and spoiled me. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And my mother did cleaning and cooking and it was something she’d never done before but she was really great, very adaptable and hardworking, just to keep us going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">QUESTION:  So she was doing this to support you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">ANSWER:  Yes and also we started out in a lovely <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> when I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Then we went to a slightly less wonderful <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And finally ended up in a <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Things were really, really bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">We were poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION:  So going back to your father leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">How did that come about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">This was still before Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">But things were bad and he was struggling and one day a letter came from <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> to present himself in the next day with his passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And he knew something was up. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">He was very intelligent and aware, even though he couldn’t believe that this would last but he knew that things were getting dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">QUESTION:  What did he think that was all about? </span><span class="sentence" id="272">https://collections.ushmm.org
ANSWER:  Well I'll tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">At that time my mother was already employed at the Palestina Unt. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Yeah, I get confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">He called her at work. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And he said Edith, come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and help me pack. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Tonight I have to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And he explained that they wanted him to present himself with his passport at <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> and he knew what that meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">They were going to put a J in it for Jew, which would mean that his traveling would be severely curtailed if not made impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And he decided he was going to flee that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Get out of there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">QUESTION:  Before they put a J on his passport.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  And so how did he leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  Well. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I think he went to his great aunt Matilda and borrowed some, she was the Christian part of the family and quite well off. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And she lent him some money and he, I think he took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to um, somehow he found -- there was two <span class="NPIP">places</span> he went to. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">He was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , trying to find a stepping stone. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I’m a little confused where he went first. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And then eventually he ended up briefly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to gain a foothold. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">But in order to enter legally into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , he needed a quota number, visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And so in those days, people in that position would either go to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Some ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And he opted or maybe it was the only choice hehad to go to Havana Cuba, to wait for this and so that’s what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">In the meantime, we had a year without him. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And I must tell you he was a marvelous cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">He was a great cook and he had made a bouillabaisse his last day and I remember after he had left, he had left in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And I don’t quite know what mode of transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">He must have taken the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> over to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">There we were with his soup that he had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And I remember my mother and I eating that soup and the tears were just rolling down our cheeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And for many, many, many years, I couldn’t stand bouillabaisse. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I just couldn’t stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Then much later on I developed a real liking for it because we were together again. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">That was something. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">It was a terrible shock to have him gone all of a sudden. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">But he saved himself and he saved us. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">By that action.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">QUESTION:  So when he left you had some awareness of what was happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">ANSWER:  OH a great deal of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">In fact fear was our constant companion. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Because then we had Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">November ninth wasn’t it? </span><span class="sentence" id="315">1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And my mother was a real Berliner. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">There’s an expression in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">If somebody comes at you all excited, we say Nabublensten (German) which means oh so where’s the fire? </span><span class="sentence" id="320">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So at 4:00 in the morning or at 4:30 or 5 there’s a pounding at the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And my mother gets up out of her sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">This is some time after my father left. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I don’t’ know how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And all grumpy and she goes to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and opens it and she said so where’s the fire? </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And the person knocking on the <span class="DLF">door</span> said the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> 1s on fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">The <span class="BUILDING">Jewish temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Thiswas Fazanemistrasse. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">The corner had <span class="BUILDING">hotel Kampinski</span> at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">That was the last address we had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And kitty corner from us across the <span class="DLF">street</span> was the, a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish synagogue</span> , which is now by the way the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Community Center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">I saw it in 1978. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">They did something very smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">They saved the front of this <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">It had been a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">They saved the <span class="DLF">doorway</span> and made a modern <span class="BUILDING">building</span> for the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Community Center</span> , and put the <span class="DLF">doorway</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">It was a striking and very beautiful thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And the strange feelings come back after so many years and see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">But anyway to get back to that horrible night or morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">My mother must have gone out the <span class="DLF">door</span> to take a peek at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I don’t’ remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">She left me upstairs in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> or maybe I slept through all of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">She stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And I remember saying oh how nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">You don’t have to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">You’re staying with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And I remember her sad smile and she said but what a reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I was too young to understand the horrible things that were going on around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And another really nightmare moment was we at this time lived in a <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And I in fact slept on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">It was a nice big old <span class="INT_SPACE">Berlin apartment</span> and the lady who lived there was a wonderful old lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Her name was Mrs. Moses. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I think her first name was Martha. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">She had a retarded daughter, a little shriveled lady, must have been in her 40s or 50s, scared me terribly because I didn’t know about retardation. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">But she was kindness itself, very old and tired looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And she was very good to my mother and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">She had some other tenants there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">She had her son living in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> above her. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And_ I think it was the day after the fire or very shortly thereabouts that there was talk of Jewish men being searched for by hordes of SA men. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">You know those were the Brown Shirts. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And therewas a brass door sign next to the <span class="DLF">apartment door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Outside the <span class="DLF">front door</span> and it said Moses on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">That was her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And some very smart person across the way said, you know if I were you, I would unscrew those screws and take that sign off. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">It’s a very Jewish name. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">They’re bound to come to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And my mother was real feisty Berliner always, said oh that’s not necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">She didn’t want to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And the reason prevailed and they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And it’s a darned good thing because later on we heard these boots on the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">My mother and I were inside the <span class="INT_SPACE">pantry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">With her arms around me, shaking like aspen leaves when we heard those pounding boots coming up the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And we heard somebody say “Oh, don’t ring there. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">There’s no Jews there” and they went on up. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I believe they got her son, either that time or later. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">She and her daughter must have ended up dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">It was just dreadful. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Anyhow, that is a moment that is probably the most frightening moment of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And we crept out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">pantry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">The Nazis had gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And then shortly thereafter 1t must have been that word came that we should go to H—from my father who had at this point reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And, and he said, he wrote, go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Go to the <span class="BUILDING">Cuban consulate</span> and get all your documentation and soon I’Il be able to send for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And so my mother and I took the—and early morning <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">It was still dark, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">QUESTION:  Now this was right away, the next day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">As a child your sense of time is really non-existent. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">It’s fueled by events. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I simply cannot tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">It must have been shortly thereafter. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I’m sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And so there we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I https://collections.ushmm.org thought it was the greatest treat in the world to sit in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining car</span> , a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">No, white table cloths and silver and waiters. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And I remember eating a soft boiled gg and looking out the <span class="DLF">train window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I took my enjoyment where I found it you know. (</span><span class="sentence" id="402">laughs) I thought that was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Well then we trudged through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and we went to the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Everything was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">It was lunch time. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And I was getting hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And my mother, everywhere she saw a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> it said Jews aren’t wanted, forbidden to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And she was a mother first and she decided the heck with all of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">She had young child here and she was going to see to it that that child got some lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And so we just walked into one of those <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> and ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And of course it didn’t mean much to me but you can imagine her feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And then shortly after that I was able to leave the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and happy word came that —
QUESTION:  Wait a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">You weren’t—did you go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> or did you stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">ANSWER:  Oh yes, this was just a trip to get documentation from the <span class="BUILDING">Cuban consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And then shortly there—
