<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  That’s what it was set up for including to go on Hachshara. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Hachshara meant the preparation to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to learn to farm and work the <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But again you couldn’t officially call it Hachshara so we were assigned to help the farmers in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as unpaid labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  So you went out in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  From the Jewish council, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish office</span> , they had to put together the list which they had to go to the SS to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">From the Jewish elders, you send out, at that time we still had young people working there with the notification, the name 5 of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and with that we had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">holding place</span> which was an old <span class="BUILDING">exhibition hall</span> emptied out called the Messacalanda. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Sometimes we had a couple of hours, sometimes even more. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">We were permitted to take one small suitcase or backpack, something we could carry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Was there a limit on how many pounds that could be? </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  There was and I don’t remember it any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">It was something like 20 kilo but I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I really am not sure but I know there was a way we could pack and again the youth organization we called that formed Helping Hand would send us out to the older people that couldn’t carry and couldn’t pack. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">We would pack for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Like we had a way of packing the shoes to the side and the blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Since in Europe you had this old-style, heavy down-feather , it was called blankets, we established a <span class="INT_SPACE">sewing room</span> where people could bring ahead of time in preparation for transports, their blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We would empty out the feathers, we would stitch it small and flat and restuff it with their feathers. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">That was called — we sort of established a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> this size, a <span class="INT_SPACE">sewing room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Everybody was prepared and had sort of a blanket you could roll up and put on top of your --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  It’s interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Which was all done by the Zionist youth organizations, all volunteers. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">We helped to do these things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  Did you have any contact with your brother after -- between the time that he left and you left, did letters come back from him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  No letters, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">He was able to send out through somebody on a little -- I remember that so clearly -- a little torn piece of paper with one word on it, Terezin. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So we knew where he was at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  But that’s it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  That was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">That was pretty dangerous to do at any rate for who smuggled. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">The way he smuggled it out, if he would have been caught including whoever helped him smuggle it and brought it back to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Later on we followed him and we saw him in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">We were in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="549">QUESTION:  Thomas ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">ANSWER:  Thomas , right. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">That’s why this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> is called the transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Actually, at that time, as far as I researched it and understood, out of the 5,000 that’s also in the movie Shoah, I mentioned, only 2,800 were still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">The others had perished due to starvation, sickness, beating, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">My father and my brother had perished before.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="562">ANSWER:  But I still had the number and they chose his transport number was the one I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">A 90% possibility, what happened as the Jewish Elder, when he volunteered, that he gave him my number. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">18
QUESTION:  He took your number, to save you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER:  Then know, we didn’t know saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">But since they only could have five thousand and they had 5,004 but that is not proved fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I am putting this together in my mind and in my research. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I have no proof of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">QUESTION:  Now this is a bad question to ask you but you don’t know exactly what happened to your brother and father, only that they died before --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="570">ANSWER:  The way I understand that the 5,000 were kept together. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">They were not separated; they were kept together in <span class="BUILDING">familalager Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">They had to work, the ones that were able and the ones who died, died of either torture, malnutrition, sickness due to the malnutrition like we had dysentery, typhoid, and so on.</span></p>
