<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Please tell us your name and where and when you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Ernest Koenig and I was born on the 19th of May, 1917 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I, however, never lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I spent my childhood in a little <span class="NPIP">place</span> north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> which became a part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> after the 1st World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And I mention this <span class="NPIP">place</span> whose German name is and Czech name is because there were some three hundred Jews living there who had been there for at least four hundred, five hundred years and who had been in this <span class="REGION">region</span> possibly since Roman times. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Possibly...there is no indication. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I can trace my family back to the 16th century. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">So they lived there until 1938 when part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was occupied by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they were expelled. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And I don't want to talk about them any more except to say that of this some three hundred, two hundred eighty were killed and perished during the war through the Nazis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  The the Jews were expelled?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">They were expelled. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Not only the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Also some Czechs were expelled but the Jews were all expelled and most of them perished and I would like to mention at this point...I don't want to go in to this...uh my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My mother was together with thirty thousand Jewish women massacred in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> in July 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My...and they were...the women were in the middle and had to shovel their <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Uh the SS surrounded them. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Outside the SS were the men, where took my father too had to look at this, and the men were surrounded by either the German army or by the organization TOP (ph) which was the working arm of the Nazi movement, and there was a soldier who my father knew, either a soldier or a member of the organization TOP, and he told his men, when you come back, tell the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And he gave to this man a , . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Said well, what happened, and when I came back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , somebody called me and told me the story and by chance, I met shortly after I was told the story and little picture, I met somebody who had known my father and who told me the same story, who had witnessed...had not witnessed this. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">My father was later on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> and died there. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">OK. (</span><span class="sentence" id="23">Pause - drinking) Now we lived a happy life until 1938 when the Germans came and expelled my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I was at this time in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in order to study and I stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> until February 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">We had no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I was hungry, but really not starving but hungry, pretty hungry, so I decided to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and my parents lived in the internal part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Burno</span> (ph), <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Burn</span> (ph), and they came there and after two, three weeks being there, the Germans occupied the rest and from there my adventure started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  Before you go into that, tell us a little bit more about what you were doing, how you came to go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to study?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  I was...I have <span class="BUILDING">German schools</span> , and I was studying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> from '36 to '38...
QUESTION:  What were you studying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  At the <span class="BUILDING">German university</span> , I was first studying medicine, which I gave up, and then I studied uh uh philosophy and uh romance language and that's why I went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And when you came to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , where did you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  Well, I was first in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tulle</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="33"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tulle</span> is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> west of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and then when <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> ...when and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> had to cede its <span class="REGION">territory</span> , the so- called <span class="REGION">territory</span> , uh I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and then I still inscribed (ph) at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sorbonne</span> , but I cannot say that I studied much because we had other problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So I was there until about February 1939 and came back to see my parents and hardly was I there that the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , the rest of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and I had very great difficulty to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I was arrested by the Nazis in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bruno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Then when they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , you had to go to the Gestapo to get permission to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I had...I had a lot of luck in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">The very fact that I am here proves it, but I want to tell you one story how the Gestapo...there were some eight hundred thousand people were waiting in front of the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo building</span> to get in and get permission and the SS that I saw for the first time the SS was in the back and was beating the people but the people didn't dare to leave because they had to get their permission to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and the Gestapo distributed about twenty numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">They said we are going to go by numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">There were eight hundred people and uh there were about uh uh twenty numbers given out. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I also got a number, but when they started to call numbers and I looked for my number in the pocket, I gave them what was apparently the checking number of a <span class="BUILDING">movie house</span> , you know, I had left in my coat...1t was number four. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">The man...the man didn't see that there was...that the paper is different from what they...four...he let me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So I got out and I came to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> until the outbreak of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I stayed longer there, but until the outbreak of the war I also met at this time Elizabeth, my present wife, and when the war broke out in 1939 I volunteered for the French army. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">All Czech citizens had however to join a unit which was part of the French army but we had the command language was Czech, so I was with this Czech army unit uh from October 1939 to the breakdown of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and I should say a few words about this this Czech army unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">It consisted basically of three groups...Slovaks which had been settled in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> for a long time, which had been mobilized and which had to join this army and they were very unhappy about it because they want to join the French army, so it was the French army but it was a Czech unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Uh Czechs which had escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> from Hitler, from <span class="REGION">occupied Czechoslovakia</span> and a great number of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Perhaps forty percent of the people were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">These were people who had fled from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to what was then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and had volunteered in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> to join the ar...the Czech army in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Uh one of them is the famous uh published Maxwell who bought one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ...that's the New York Post...one of the New York papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  Did you serve with these people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  Yeah, and I served with these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  And what what what was that like? </span><span class="sentence" id="53">What kind of <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> ...what kind of...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  It was very...we were very badly treated, all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Incidentally, there was anti-Semitism in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">There was no anti-Semitism in the all-<span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> but there was anti-Semitism, even anti-Semitic remarks made by officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">The army was very badly treated by the French. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">It was ill-equipped. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">It was...the food was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">We lived in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where the wind was blowing through and there happened to be...we were in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> where generally the the climate is mild, but it was a very cold winter, the winter of 1939-1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And we believed we are kind of parade army and we will be used when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> 1s defeated, we will be used as the as the core of the Czech army, which will move back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , but when <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> suffered one defeat after the other, in May 1940 we were well-equipped, or relatively well-equipped and we were sent to the front and we were...we were positioned uh east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> as part of the army to defend <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and the front was broken and we retreated. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">We were again...I...my...there there were only small units left. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">This unit in with which I was was again used at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">| River</span> and that was the end of the of the campaign of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64"><span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was defeated and uh I like other people tried to get away from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Now some people went to where the army in <span class="REGION">southern France</span> ...where the army had originally been stationed. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I tried to get to <span class="REGION">western France</span> and to get from <span class="REGION">western France</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or to the west, but I couldn't get on any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and finally...finally I ended up at the at the <span class="DLF">Spanish frontier</span> together with some other boys and we thought we would go into <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> so we were afraid of this because we guessed that uh in Franco Spain we would be arrested and while we were approaching the <span class="DLF">frontier</span> , we learned from the radio that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> will not occupy the whole of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> but only a stretch of <span class="REGION">territory</span> uh inland from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Atlantic</span> , so when you were beyond this <span class="DLF">demarkation line</span> , you would be in unoccupied France, so we didn't go to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">We went to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and then to to this unoccupied part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and there I was together with French refugees, my comrades...they're not close friends but whom I had just met...and they went to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in <span class="REGION">southern France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">There again I became...or not again, but first I became a teacher in a very interesting family. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">The family was in part very pro-German, very pro-German and the elder part...the elder parts of the family were happy that <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> had been defeated and that was so because one of the ladies...1t was a tremendous family...one of the ladies was the daughter of the French Prime Minister who in 19...in 1866...who in 1870 uh had declared war on <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and on Napoleon the Third and had said we enter this war with a light...with a light-heart, light-heartedly, . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And uh six weeks later they were beaten in , SO this lady found a certain satisfaction in the fact that not only her father and her friends under her father's regime had been defeated but but also...but also <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> again, but they were very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">The young people were...were anti-German. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">They were very nice and I stayed with them and I taught a little boy and a young girl until one day my wife, my present wife, came and found me there and we traveled together toto _, a little <span class="NPIP">place</span> , near near the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lemouge</span> (ph) where her father and her mother had been and they found themselves after dramatic circumstances because millions of French people had left, had fled the Germans at this time, and uh I stayed with them but they had nothing to eat and I decided there...and they shared everything but I decided I can't stay with them, so I went on my way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Why <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">It was in the unoccupied zone and there I was demobilized by the French and there I got a carde identite (ph) as a student. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Now very few foreigners had a carde identite, a permission of staying in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I had one but it...from this I couldn't live and after many attempts to...after many attempts to to find some way of uh ma...making a living which I couldn't do, I I found a job as I told you before in <span class="REGION">western France</span> , again as a teacher in a family, in an aristocratic refuge family and I I decided to go there and but you you could only travel at this time with a special permit, de voyage (ph) it was called so I went to the police and asked for a de voyage and they told me why why you want to go there and I said my aunt is sick because...it wasn't very cleaver but I had no better...nothing better in mind, so uh they didn't give it. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">They said uh bring me a certificate from the doctor of your aunt, so of course I didn't bring any. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and went to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I was there for several weeks, but this <span class="NPIP">place</span> was...this family lived in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , had a very nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and of course the people saw me. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I was a foreigner there and the police there uh paid attention to me and I had not...I should have registered with the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I should...I didn't register. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I didn't do anything, so after three days...after three weeks, I was arrested and I was sent to the County Vernet (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Uh now that was a very arbitrary act because the County Vernet of which I will speak immediately was one of the worst camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">It was the worst <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> as far as I know, but uh I was sent there. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I was sent with uh together with a pastor, a Romanian pastor who in 19 uh...a protestant pastor who in 1934 had crossed the Place de la Concorde (ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> during big demonstrations and he was stopped and he showed his identity card. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">He was released but apparently...he had nothing to do with this demonstration. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">He was a church man. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">They took his identity and then they caught him somewhere and they had his identity that he participated, he was in this demonstration. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So uh he was with me and then a poor Portuguese worker who apparently was in the same situation as I had been, working without permission and had been there without identity card, so we got sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vernet</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  And you were arrested not as a Jew but as a...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Not as a Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Could you talk a little bit about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">It's important to realize because projections back often...are often misleading that while in the fall of 1940, the Vichy government started to issue uh anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish laws, generally when we had to deal with the police and even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> we were not singled out as being Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">There was no anti-Semitism except in there... mean no open anti-Semitism except in in Government levels but we didn't hear any any anti- Jewish remarks and uh anti-Semitism came in to force for us only when we were deported, or when people were arrested as Jews, but that was much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Of course, many French people might have lost their jobs or their business, but I speak now from my own personal experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">There was no anti-Semitic movement or attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">We were dirty foreigners. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">The French have an expression... . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Dirty foreigner, and we belonged to the dirty foreigner who potentially took away...took away French jobs, but this reminds me that during my flight uh to the south when the army was dispersed and I tried to go get on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , I was once by chance...in the very last days of the French campaign in a <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> , a <span class="INT_SPACE">railroad compartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">There were three British students and a lady, and the lady turned out to be the wife of the French Ambassador to Franco, . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">She was Madame , and the Monsieur was the successor to , and she came into the <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">She was very friendly and she said since . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">She says these are the German Jews who have done us this, and this slogan you heard very often, but that was general. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">That was government propaganda. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I personally didn't experience nor observe any anti-Semitism until much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">This was a very, very very populist organi...in the right wing circles. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">The Ger...German Jews have done us this. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">This incidentally comes...goes back to the Dreyfuss (ph) affair, because he was a German Jew for...they was also persecuted him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  And once you were interned at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vernet</span> ...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  Now I have to speak about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vernet</span> first and describe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="112"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vernet</span> was a camp erected in the Ist World War for Austrian prisoners of war, for Austrian prisoners of war, for their Austrian soldiers at the <span class="REGION">German front</span> uh front uh in 1914, 1918, and when they were captured, they were imprisoned there and in 1939 the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp was</span> used to imprison dangerous foreigners, and these were primarily Germans, Nazis, Nazis who had been caught in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and who hadn't returned...returned in time and then also foreign communists because they were also considered dangerous in view of the fact that uh communists were against the war at the very beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">They said Hitler and the western powers, that Hitler and the western powers are the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">It's an imperialistic war as they said. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Now uh when <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was defeated, the Nazis who had been imprisoned there, were freed and in addition to Communists, all kinds of people were imprisoned there and there was no longer a question of being dangerous to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> or not dangerous to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Uh people were imprisoned there, and I will tell you was imprisoned at the end before _____, before we were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">There were people from all over Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">They were , for instance German first one you was imprisoned there and then...not in my time anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">He got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And then Otto Kirsler (ph), the the British, the Hungarian-British writer, and uh it was a horrible <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="121">The horror of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> consisted in the fact that perhaps it was different before but after the defeat, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> started to ration. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Food was scarce and the food they gave to the prisoners was a hunger ration. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">You got something black in the morning which was supposed to be coffee, two hundred fifty grams of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">At noon...at...1n the forenoon, in the morning, which was the basis of all our food. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">At noon we got a water soup with carrots or with uh onions and in the evening we got, believe it or not, one artichoke and some of for drink...long period...one artichoke or a little bit of artificial honey, sometimes a glass of uh of wine. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Now wine has calories. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">The net effect of this was that uh if people didn't get help from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , parcels or some help in some other way, they died after about one year, and many people died there. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">The regime was very strict and from time to time they shot somebody, always saying that the person wanted to escape and that was probably partly true but partly was other...their method of intimidating people. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">As I said, there were foreigners from all over Europe and the Gestapo came from time to time together with German officials and asked people whether they want to work voluntarily in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and many people see that they can't survive, Poles in particular, Hungarians uh volunteered for work in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I have read...I don't know anymore where, but I believe it's true...that there were other Jews from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , who said they wantto sin <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Didn't say they were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">They were Hungarians, and they survived in this way as foreign workers in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Uh I stayed there for two years and the hygienic conditions were horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">We were filthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">We were dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We had nothing to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">We had lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">We had fleas. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Many people died, of course, from diseases, but...
QUESTION:  Did you work? </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Was there work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">We didn't have to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We didn't have to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We had to do some what they called , some work in...for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , you know, but otherwise we didn't have to work and being told all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I was...after...I don't know...after I was there for a while I was called and said...by the...by a captain whose name incidentally was Vernet, Captain Vernet, and Captain Vernet said you are here by mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Uh yes, we recognize you have been in the army and so we will send you to a better <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and that happened...I was in say a month and at the beginning it raised my my hope and my morale and I didn't believe inin _ anymore, but I got indeed some privilege because of their alleged mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I was made deputy postmaster, . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">That is to say I was allowed to work...I was allowed to work at the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> and that was from a moral point of view very helpful because I was busy with something. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I was distributing letters and uh parcels but I was...I was terribly...my wife had sent me for a while food but then she left <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and I suffered terribly from hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">It's there where I started to smoke because when you smoke, it seems that the the smoke, when you inhale the smoke, would would pacify the hunger pangs and it it hurt badly but in reality 1t was burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">You know, the smoke just gave you a burning feeling, and it was very very uh very very painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Hunger was the great problem there and, of course, hunger was the one problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">The other great problem was the lack of liberty. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I was a young person and uh we lived there like animals, imprisoned there. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">We hadn't done anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So it was very, very depressing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  How did people spend hours of the day? </span><span class="sentence" id="158">What did they do with themselves?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  Uh I, for instance, was reading a tremendous lot and many people were were reading a tremendous lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Other people there were...I don't reca...there were small Jewish religious groups but I must repeat that wasn't a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span> so it was a camp for foreigner, so many of the foreigners were Jewish, but except for knowing that there were Jewish, there was no identification of being Jewish and there were other religious groups, Jewish religious people which...whom I haven't seen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ...I haven't seen any...a few I have to ...uh what did they do? </span><span class="sentence" id="161">They were desperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Uh they played chess and they they were singing and they were...for instance, we had to...we had...we had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">group toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">We had big containers and we had to carry it out to the peasants and some people when we...when we carried this out to the peasants, some people would exchange a shirt and the peasant would uh would give you some bread or something, but they would also give you...give you wheat but and we had a very primitive <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> there which somebody had constructed and we milled the wheat and from time to time we made a big uh a big uh feast, you know, out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">We we cooked...we boiled the wheat and that was a great feast because people had saved for this and people had gotten parcels. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Some people got parcels. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">It was also from a moral point of view very, very depressing. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">You were a prisoner, but a prisoner who was innocent, a prisoner who couldn't say oh, hadn't I done this, because we hadn't done anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">The one thing which kept our morale up and that is true of this period and that is true of the...of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> later on, was the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">We had a feeling unlike the prisoners who were sent by Stalin to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , who had no hopes that Stalinism would ever end, we had a great hope that the war will end and Nazi Germany will be defeated and we had a feeling that the others, our friends, people fight for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">That kept the morale up and we followed very closely political events. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">We could have papers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> some people had Swiss papers and uh we always hoped now that they will be defeated now, now they will be defeated...never were defeated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  Uh was there a sense that that there was a time limit to how long you would be there or this was just an interminable thing? </span><span class="sentence" id="173">You you would...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  It was interminable, because every event like for instance uh well, in our case it was the...it was the attack of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> by the Nazis, where we believed that will be the end of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but later on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when we learned about the invasion of Europe by the Allies, by the American and British armies, we always believed now it's the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">It was never the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">It was very frustrating. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I mean never. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">But uh I've never been in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> by I mean in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , people think they have done something and if they're they're...they were innocently imprisoned, and then they had a time limit on their stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">They're there for...they're there for for for life...they have a life sentence, but there there was no hope except the end of the war and a victorious end of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  And would you tell us now about when you were deported, how that happened, how you felt, the people that you had to leave or went with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">On the 7th of August, 1942...let me say perhaps on the 6th of August, 1942...no. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Let me say on the 6th or 5th, we could see from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> the little <span class="BUILDING">station</span> of ____ <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vernet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">There was a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vernet</span> , and you could see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">It was uh perhaps a mile away but you could see it, and we saw on the 5th or the 6th of uh August that there are <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> there which generally were not there and probably on the 6th, a great number of people were surrounded in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> because in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we were...and you believed you are...you were free in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="186">You can...within limits, you were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">We were surrounded and ___ say they would be deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Now all of them were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">There were many non-Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but I do believe we didn't realize that all of them were Jews because as I said before, there was...we didn't feel being Jews in this sense that we were singled out, and they were deported and they were marched to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">At the end of August of 1942, something uh incredible happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Whole families came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> these were all Jews, people, Jewish people who had taken refuge in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and who had managed to live outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> who had some even jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">How they managed, I don't know...if some lived from their savings and had some savings...but they were people living <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and they were all brought into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and that was far sensational. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Not only...we had...there were no women in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> so there were not only men and women came in...whole families and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">We hadn't seen children for two years, and uh they were not badly treated. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Uh they had enough to eat and they were, of course, deeply depressed and I guess they knew already but we might have heard too, that there were de...deportations of Jews to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because I think some people listened...could listen or to the to the British broadcast. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">They had heard about it, so this was an all Jewish affair. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">That was very clear, and it was a deportation affair and the first transport was also deportation, but it wasn't very clear...didn't seem so much as a punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">It could be interpreted as a...and since it was only men, it could be interpreted as meaning they are going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">The Germans uh uh always hired people who were imprisoned or wanted those people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> so that they took Jews to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was a bit strange but we didn't think about this as far as I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">It's now fifty years, but as far as I remember about the second time, this was ominous. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">This was dangerous, and we couldn't understand what it means. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And there was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> a group of perhaps fifteen, twenty people like I who had been in the French army, and we were suddenly separated from the others and we believed that we are separated because <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> would never send the people who had...who have fought for <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , would never surrender those people to the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">On the contrary I mean what they did was to be sure that we don't run away, they...it wasn't impossible to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">In spite of all the guards and for men like...who like me who had a right to be around in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp because</span> I was postmaster, it would have been considerably possible, like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> later. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I'll tell you about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">It was possible, possible to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">But what happened afterwards is the second question because where would you ever run. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">You had no papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">You had no mon...money. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Uh people there are certainly hostile. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">If you were to knock at their <span class="DLF">door</span> , who would have helped you. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">But so they wanted to be sure that we don't run away, but we cer...we misinterpreted this. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">As a matter of fact there was in the camp a French police officer who was and I was quite on good terms with him because he spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I spoke German with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">One day...and on this day he came and said I have to arrest you, and he arrest me to bring me in the group of the former soldiers and when I realized what I...what he was saying, I spit at him and he slapped me, but it was in a friendly way, and he had likewise because it was profound dishonor. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">The French think their honor 1s...their honor has been maintained, the honor of the French army. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">It was profound dishonor to sen...to send off...apart from everybody else certainly, but to send off to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because the Germans could have killed us immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I mean we were...they could have said we...you are former citizens of a <span class="REGION">territory</span> which we have occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Therefore, it's against your own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">You are...you...that is high treason and you have to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="222">On the first of September 19...well, after...after this excitement with having all the people there, these families, and...but they had enough to eat and uh everybody was, of course, preoccupied so again the the the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and we knew what they meant and on the Ist of September, we were led out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Now that was unforgettable. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">It was unforgettable because there were some of the old people with us, old ladies, old men, you know, who had not been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> before who were now being imprisoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Women, children...children, and the worst of all, the most depressing thing was that there were perhaps ten, twelve cripples, people who had no legs, such cripples, and I...I don't recall having seen them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> before but it's possible that they had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> before, and they were moving on little boards and they had little...little...little wheels, you know, and that's how they were moving forward and I mention them because at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> there was the French Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">They were very kind and very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">They had...they had an inkling of what...what...what's happening to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Very sad, very kind...their behavior was contradictory and they had to...to lift these cripples into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">You see, these cripples couldn't...couldn't walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">They couldn't...and they had to lift them into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> and there was also something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Nearby was I think the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vernet</span> and the church bells were ringing, so we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">We were...we were deported to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> within <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">They...we were not...we were not uh like sardines pressured like later on when we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and we were, of course, all the time debating and thinking what does it mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Uh the Germans are going to send us to work, but why would they take us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">You know, the the the German Jews who have been expelled from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1940 to Guerres (ph), thousands of them, and now they're taking all the Jews back. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">What does it mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Supposed they are going to to have us work. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Why do they take children and and and women? </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Why did they take these cripples? </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And there was an endless debate and not only a debate among ourselves but I myself started all the time to figure out all the possibilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">There was no...there was no answer, but if they would massacre everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Nobody thought of this....not out of question...I mean that they would kill one or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They have...we knew they had killed people. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">They would kill many, yes, but that they would kill all of us or that their practice was to exterminate these people...and I came finally to the conclusion but that was later on, they are establishing a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish slave state</span> somewhere in the Ukrain and sure they want to have everybody in this slave...you will be slaves. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Now uh I managed to send a postcard from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with the help of a French gendarme to my brother who was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> where I said I am going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but I really didn't want to, or something to this effect, and see he got the card and it was terribly depressing. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">After having escaped the Germans, now for years with all the sufferings we had gone through, suddenly everything was in vain. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">We...we went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Uh I was with a couple of uh younger persons in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> , and we considered breaking out but again the question was, you know, we could have lifted the boards. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">There was nothing in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> but the boards. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Uh perhaps you could have lifted them and jumped out and we were...also it was strange the French uh gendarmes, not not the Germans but uh then the question arose . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Where are we going? </span><span class="sentence" id="252">We will be caught again. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">So after perhaps twenty-four hours, we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> and that's in...and then then ——_—~ Drancy. </span><span class="sentence" id="254"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> looked horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="255"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> consisted of <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> or which had been made for the French police before the war and which could not be occupied because they were wet and badly built, so they stood empty, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I know...I think they stood empty before we came. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Not only before we came...before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> became a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Uh we left incidentally on the Ist...on the lst of September...the Ist of September of Vernet. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">We were perhaps on the 2nd or the 3rd in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> , which is in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">It was fully of concentra...of uh of of uh barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Of course, we couldn't see the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">We know there were other sections, except the section where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">We were put into <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> which were full of uh rotten straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">It was rotting, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">It's wet and rotting, and there we were waiting, and, of course, uh uh being very much concerned and preoccupied what's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">It was a morbid situation already you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Under the rotten straw and with children and uh old people and the complete uh uh the complete helplessness and the complete lack of uh of...we didn't know what's going to happen...to happen to us but we knew, of course, we are now in the clutches of the German and at night we heard sometimes shooting from other parts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">We didn't know what it means. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I remember I I went to one of the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> and saw...and tried to see whether I can get...I can get out but it was out of questioning, and then after three or four days there, uh we were ordered to go down...down...we we were upstairs I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">We had to go downstairs, you know, to the...to the <span class="DLF">platform</span> and on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> there was already the SS and with...with their customary politeness, shouting and beating and and uh sending us into the...into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Now, the <span class="DLF">French railroads</span> had on every...perhaps they have it to day...I don't think they have it today, but in the 2nd World War, an inscription saying forthe _. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">That was from the Ist World War and they still have it in the 2nd World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">For the . [</span><span class="sentence" id="274">know we were, but I I know this from having read it later on because I didn't know it there, we were...the the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was transport number 28. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">It was I think signed by the Chief of the Gestapo in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , the destination was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and we were close to a thousand people, and I know this...I didn't know this at that time...because the has...you know who she 1s...she has found documents all about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and the Germans being very German and very meticulous, gave our names, our birthdate and our nationality, so I am on the list of now of the transport number 28. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And uh that was signed by the Gestapo in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Destination...I think even Eichmann's...Eichmann's name appears in this uh...
QUESTION:  Had you been at this point identified as a Jew and were you being deported as a Jew, or was it still as a foreign national?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  Clear...by this time they knew we were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I mean not only...we knew it before. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We were treated like Jews, but not like foreign nationals, and I'll you immediately why we knew this. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">But we were never told, and I have always said, no Nazi ever now told why I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I was never told why I was persecuted by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I would say...no, they didn't...but they treated us like Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I mean they treated us like uh like non-human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">They beat us and they shouted and uh the worst thing which happened was when I stayed with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">French freight cars</span> were for forty...forty men or eight horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I guess they put in about eighty people. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">I cannot say how many, but I do know when we were...when we came in, we came into the in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight</span> , into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> , on on the on the side opposite the <span class="DLF">door</span> were little...they're little <span class="DLF">openings</span> and they were with barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">You could look out there but not very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">It was pretty dark there, and it... we were so crowded that when you sat down, you couldn't stretch your leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">You...you couldn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">You you were...you were fixed in this position. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">There were women, children, old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">They gave us...they gave us and I think they gave us enough bread and apples...apples. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">But they gave us two buckets. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">One a bucket for water and the other a bucket for as a tol...using...serving...serving as a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , and this bucket serving as a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , of course, had a tremendously depressing effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">How could...I don't know whether there were eighty...we were more than forty...we were sixty, seventy, perhaps we were eighty. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Perhaps we were ninety. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">How could we...that would be horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">We realized it from the very beginning, and I do remember there was no fear of not having enough food, because you see, uh we had gotten bread and French...and especially those of us who had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vernet</span> had been hungry, oh there was plenty of bread, apples, and I think even pate, French pate in big...in big...so there was no...we were not...I wasn't afraid of uh of starving, at least at this moment, but...and also with the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I mean how long can water, such water last. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And then we are...you asked me about Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I cannot now identify that was clearly we were Jewish, but I do know two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">As we moved into the into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> , a young man stepped out of the...out of the of the <span class="DLF">line</span> and shouted to the SS, I am not Jewish, and they talked with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I don't know what happened uh what happened to him, whether they took him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">There was a second man, and I'll tell you later about him, who was not Jewish but who didn't dare to say who he was and he preferred to be with the Jews and there, of course, when we...I say we were in the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> , and we stepped down to the <span class="DLF">platform</span> and we went on the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , the French gendarmes tried to take everything away from us, our watches. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">They said you won't need this anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">But that was meaningless, only we found that is mean on their part. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">It is possible, likely even that the SS shouted dirty Jews, but I cannot...I don't recall this. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I mean it was clear now we were Jews, andI mentionit —_—. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Now started the trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , or not quite to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> as you will hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Uh at the beginning, of course, everybody was depressed and after a couple of hours uh people had to go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and they couldn't see well, and __ broke out and people shouted at each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Uh the water was soon exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">The water was also exhausted I I guess because people thought I'd better take advantage. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Even if they were not thirsty, they start to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I was preoccupied with the idea what's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I heard...the only identity which I had with me was my French army what you call it...what you have here...
QUESTION:  Bracelet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">ANSWER:  Bracelet...and it had a number...7 - 7 - 7, and here I have the number 1-7-7-7-7-4, SO...
QUESTION:  Uh Linda would like you to repeat the phrase about the bracelet so my voice isn't in there, so the only identity...just say it again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  The only identity...iden...not id...1identity, document or identity piece which I had on myself was a military bracelet which...from my military service in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> which had a number 7 - 7 - 7. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And it...and I I threw away at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">That's really the point I want to make. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I threw it away somehow because I thought it would indicate that I have been in the French army, which was right, but the strange coincidence is that there were three 7's, and here I have four 7's on my...here. (</span><span class="sentence" id="323">Cough) So after a couple of hours, pandemonium broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">People were crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">People were uh shouting, wailing. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">It was...there was the terrible stench and people always...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped quite often. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I remember it stopped once I believe in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mintz</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Mintz, in in the <span class="REGION">Alsace</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I I figured it's Mintz, in the <span class="REGION">Alsace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And people shouted to to the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , open the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">We want to so that we throw the the the excrements out and we want water, but the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were not opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Then we came...there was a little incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">We came into a big <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and I believe it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> or _. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">It was in a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and opposite our tra...1n the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped and opposite our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was a first class <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> of Germans and they stared at us, and and a lady who was...a woman who was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> took her little girl and and held it up to the little <span class="DLF">window</span> with barbed wire, and shouted, water, please, water, please, water. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And the Germans...there were...there were fifty in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> ...in this other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , looked at us and they didn't move because they were afraid and I mean there was no satisfaction on their...they could have shouted dirty Jews, which happened later on, but nothing , and suddenly a German woman was running on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> with a container with water and her husband behind her who wanted to restrain her and the soldier went after her and she didn't stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">She wanted to give water to this...to us...to this...to this woman in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and then she had to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I mean we didn't get any water. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Then a man came to this <span class="DLF">window</span> , one of the inmates, and he scratched himself somehow on this barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">No, not voluntarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">He wanted himself and injured himself, and he was profuse...profusely bleeding and...but I don't know what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Somebody was shooting but he wasn't shooting at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">There were shots <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">He believed, or he shouted he had been...he has been shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">He hadn't been shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">He had scratched himself, so you know, it is...1t was a situation which nobody can describe. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">No Dante...no...1t was inferno...inferno, which is indescribable. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I read a lot about the Holocaust and apparently there were similar, very similar experiences in other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">deportation trains</span> , very similar. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">The crowding, the one bucket for water and for uh for for for excrement as a tol...use a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I think it was a widely shared experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Of course, not many people can tell about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I do not know how long we traveled. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">It seemed to me four days, but it might have been less...day and night and we didn't know any more whether there was day or night so we had little <span class="DLF">windows</span> but inside in spite of the <span class="DLF">windows</span> it was very...1t was very dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I do not recall that there was hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Perhaps people...I don't know...but I mean the the people were thirsty and and and we were...we were already... mean some people had the feeling they are trying to kill us there, so suddenly after three, or four or five days...I don't know...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped in an open <span class="DLF">field</span> and we heard shout...shouting...shoutings...everybody...all men between I guess they said fifty and...fifteen and fifty...I don't know...something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Perhaps...yeah, probably...fifteen and fifty...all men between fifteen and fifty, out. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Women and children remain <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Well, we jumped out of the...out of the...out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and there was...there was a little <span class="DLF">hill</span> and we walked...we we run down the <span class="DLF">hill</span> , and the SS came and and uh and uh uh pushed all the people back, but you see there were some younger people, young men who didn't want to separate from their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">They didn't want to come down, so they tried to get them down and the same woman who had shown her child in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> on the <span class="BUILDING">German station</span> , walked out and an SS man came...with the child...and an SS man came and threw the child against the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and probably killed the child and shoved the mother back and she carried the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">It was bleeding. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">She had the child back. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And we walked down a little <span class="DLF">slope</span> and suddenly let me go back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I really do not recall and cannot really imagine now how...what happened with this one bucket and with this...with this bucket of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">You know, the bucket of water was, of course, empty, but the toilet bucket, I know it was overflowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">There was stench. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">I must say I personally wouldn't recall that I used it. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I don't recall, and there was stench. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">There was dirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">There was...you know, the the excrements were all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Also, when you're in a lot of stench, you become insensitive to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">You don't...I don't think you you you don't feel it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Uh it was hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">It was depressing. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Also physiologically de...depressing. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Uh you were not very active, not very alert, but I must say...that's a very good question...I do not really know what people did after the bucket...and I myself...after all, as I say, I think it was between three or five days...I myself don't recall, and after all, after three or five days you have some need to go somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I don't recall.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">QUESTION:  Would you tell us again now about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopping? </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Where it stopped?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped near a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kozel</span> (ph), which is in Upper Salasia and which is I believe atthe __ <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">It stopped in the open <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Uh we uh the young...the men capable of work between fifteen and fifty, I believe, were...they were told to get out and all the others to remain <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">There were, of course, people with family who were let's say twenty years old, or thirty years old or husband or wife who didn't want to separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">They were pushed out by the SS and the women and the children and the older people remained in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> then left. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">We saw it still leaving, after this incident where an SS man threw a child, a little girl against the...against the the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and we were then uh beaten and shouted at and uh by the SS and after a while, after this went on for a while all of the story with the shoes...I don't know we...I think they wanted to take shoes away...at least they didn't take mine...we were loaded on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and we rode to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kozel</span> and this was...this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kozel camp</span> was near the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kozel</span> , and you can see it on the map. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">It can be easily identified. </span><span class="sentence" id="388"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kozel</span> was, as far as I know, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transition camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">That is to say, out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kozel</span> people were sent into different directions, either to labor or to the gas, but we didn't know about gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Uh we were there and we were...in the morning we had to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">It was heavy work, construction work, on the high....<span class="DLF">highway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">It was very important that I speak about this because people think of gas and beating and sickness and starvation, but people were killed by simple work because people were unused...they're not accustomed, many people were not accustomed to working and with us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kozel</span> was a large group of Dutch Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">They had...we had a uniform at this time, so you could see from their suits, these were middle and upper class people. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">You know...they had jacket and you could see their hat and how they had lived and how they had dressed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and these people were completely incapable of meeting these very rough conditions, both the treatment...the shouting, the beating... and the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">You had...for ten hours we had with the...we had with the shovel and with the what you call the uh...
QUESTION:  Pick axe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">ANSWER:  Pick axe...you had to to loosen the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , and they couldn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I mean I myself had difficulty, the greatest difficulty. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Some friends helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I couldn't do it the whole day, but they couldn't do it at all so they they stopped working. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Uh the the the overseers came and they beat them. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">The beating worsened their conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">They fell to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Many of them perished there and they perished I would say primarily because they were unable to to do the heavy work. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And it's very important to see this aspect of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">It wasn't that they were beaten to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">There were some were beaten to death, but it was the work which finished them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">QUESTION:  When you say that your friends helped you, can you talk a little bit about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="408">How did that work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">ANSWER:  Well, everybody tried to help everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I think you couldn't be an egotist in this situation...I mean only concentrate on yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">You helped your buddy, like he he wasn't a friend in the sense of being a a long...as a result of a long friendship. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Everybody tried to help everybody else, if you could. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Some people couldn't, but I can tell you later on about . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">So many people died there and uh I don't know how long we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Not long, three days perhaps, and then they formed from the prisoners there, groups and sent them to various <span class="NPIP">places</span> , some probably to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> which we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Uh we were...we that is to say, we...not all of the people who had come with me, but I...the people with whom I was were put into a strangely enough not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car train</span> but a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger cars</span> and as far as I can...as I can uh remember, we went towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> but this is constructed afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I think there came other...other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> were were added to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and we moved...we...first our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> moved first east and we were not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and perhaps we came very near to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and then it moved it west to...when I say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I mean <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , because there were many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz camps</span> ...and then we moved west and now let me tell you very briefly why we moved west. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Uh there was a man who came with me from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vernet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="419">He had gotten very nice uh stamps and uh...from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vernet</span> and the French uh postal officials always stole his stamps so he asked me to take letters addressed to him and bring them to him personally, so I knew him a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">His name was Stanislov Kubacheck (ph), and when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> moved west and we moved to , he was standing next to me and suddenly started to talk to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">He said to me, I am not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I am a Polish officer, and I cannot say that I am a Polish officer because...you see, he had some confidence in me because I had given him...I had preserved his nice stamps, and if he dared to say that he is a Polish officer, they would take him out and kill him. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And he later on...I'll tell you later on...he helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">He really saved my life twice, so it was Stanislov Kubacheck and then we...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went west and we came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauerhutte</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauerhutte</span> ...you know what a <span class="BUILDING">hutte</span> 1s...a <span class="BUILDING">hutte</span> in German is a combination between a <span class="DLF">mine</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">blast furnace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">In Upper Salasia it was full of heavy industry and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauerhutte</span> was one of those huttes where you had blasted <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnaces</span> and where you had...I don't know whether there was a <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="427"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauerhutte</span> which is the German name is...was part of a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called...a relatively big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">industrial city</span> called in German Hindenburg (ph) after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hindenburg</span> , and I know it was called in Polish , and it's a combination of many industrial smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauerhutte</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauerhutte</span> was a...had several old blast furnaces and they installed in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauerhutte</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> ...I don't know how many were there, there were perhaps five hundred or eight hundred people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">We were sleeping in big <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> where there had been boilers before and we...the the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> was in this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , so we didn't have far to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">We went from the...from where we slept through a little <span class="DLF">door</span> into the pla...to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">It was very strange that we were guarded by a group which looked like SR...not SS...SR or organization ____. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">They were very rude. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">They were elderly people. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">They were very rude. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">They beat us, but the supervision of this camp was the SS and uh I must say I'm... have been never clear and I am still not clear about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz I</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz I</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz III</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">This was an outcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but I didn't know about it and it was not guarded by the SS or the SS was uh was supervising uh the...our supervision, the old guard and once there was a big scandal. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Those who guarded us were accused of having had some deals with some Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> who had brought diamonds into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and the SS arrested our guards, but they arrested other guards which were not SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauerhutte</span> ...whatever the the Polish name I don't know...the work was very, very, very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I remember when they assigned together...I was assigned to this...we were dismantling one of the old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">blast furnaces</span> and we were carrying heavy pieces of wood which had been in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">blast furnace</span> ...in this...in the install...installation of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">blast furnace</span> , and, you know, that was so heavy that uh perhaps eight men...uh we had iron iron uh sticks or bars and we had...eight men had to carry this, but some of them were very...of us were very weak from the beginning, and if one cou...there were perhaps four couples. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">If one couple releases or didn't didn't carry enough, the others couldn't and the whole thing fell down and injured people. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">It was hea...and and when we couldn't...when we couldn't lift 1t, we were beaten and one of the things from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> which I have never understood...sometimes people have been beaten with iron bars, and they would think they have been injured. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Sometimes they were injured. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Sometimes they were killed, but sometimes...I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">It fell in a way where nothing happened, so we were badly beaten and we were beaten to lift this thing and we couldn't lift it and people were laying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> uh and couldn't walk anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Uh that was the first month in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauerhutte</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">We came there sometimes in the middle of September. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">We left uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> , the first of September and we came there around the middle of September. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">By the beginning of November, about one third, all the Dutch were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">All the Dutch who had...didn't survive Kozel, had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And the people who died and every day people died, the people who died...we were in this big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where there had been boilers before, a <span class="INT_SPACE">boiler room</span> ... and there were...there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunker beds</span> ...beds, you know, uh three story <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , and behind us there was some straw and the Dutch people were always around into the straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">The next day they were carried out in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffin</span> ...one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffin</span> , and there was a a team (ph) which didn't do anything else but the whole day they they they carried the dead people out and uh and as I said, by November I guess one third of the people had died, and new people came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Uh at this time, before this happened, I was once ordered to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> ...now I don't know whether whether <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauerhutte</span> had a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> or whether it was , to a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and I was sitting with another buddy, with another inmate, next to the driver and in the back there were perhaps thirty or forty uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> inmates uh who had been all sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">They came from the <span class="INT_SPACE">sick bay</span> , and when we came to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , they had to undress naked and were pushed into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> and the reason why I and my buddy had to come along because we had to take their clothes and bring it back and they probably went to to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to the gas, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">AuscHwitz</span> and they went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I don't know at what time we started to realize that there are <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , but we didn't understand this...we identified <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> with <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> and I think since we were people from...coming from the west, the knowledge of what really happened was given to us by Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and from the ___ IT remember there was a group of Jews from , and they knew what happened, but they couldn't explain it either. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Frankly, nobody knew about gas...I mean now it seems strange not to know about it, but I don't think we understood it. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">We knew about <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> and you know, you didn't follow...develop your ideas since we know what happened...how the person killed in the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> ...if he burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">We didn't follow the...the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> , that was the place where people were killed, and we didn't go further and this incident which I told you about with people being sent naked, that was clearly a case, an instance where people were sent to death, but I must say it took a long time until I and I think all the others started to realize that we are condemned to dea...to die and all pe...all Jews are condemned to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">For some time we believed the Germans are crazy and just killed people but that everybody is to be killed, that we didn't understand . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Now on a personal note, around this time I once came in front of a mirror, and I saw what was called a mussulman. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">You know what a mussulman was...somebody who was so emaciated was about to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">That was the last stage when people died, and I was struck by what I saw, myself, and outside this <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I saw myself there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage can</span> , and I looked into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage can</span> and there was a book and the book contained the text of of songs by Shubert (ph) and you might know there is one song by Shubert, the Austrian composer, the death and the maiden and the death says to the maiden, don't be afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">You are not going to suffer. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">You will sleep in my arms, and that uh encouraged me very much because I said to myself OK, if I have to die, it will be sleeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">If I die, I don't have to be afraid and I wasn't afraid, and that was a very experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Shortly thereafter I was so weak that I asked for sick leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Now you could ask for sick leave...sick leave...you could ask not to go to work for one day but it was very dangerous because when you came to the <span class="INT_SPACE">sick bay</span> and then you went... . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">| was so weak I stayed in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and I didn't want to go _. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I was what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">I couldn't anymore and this Stanislov Kubacheck, this Polish officer who had become a kapo, helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">In the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the kapo has...had to...had to watch whether his people got one ration...got their food, and he had to watch others that they don't don't come twice and take food twice, so he allowed me to go twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I was the first and came the last one. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Then he took me to his commander in his team and I didn't have to work, so I recovered and I must say amongst the many circumstances why I survived, that was one, but it's only one because there were thousands other dangers which I was exposed to and that's then another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Uh I must say from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauerhutte</span> we also were sent to work in combination. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I don't remember where the <span class="DLF">mines</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Perhaps there were no <span class="DLF">mines</span> anymore, only the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">blast furnaces</span> , and I worked in where we had to...where we had to to dig the founda...the foundations for a new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">blast furnace</span> in order to which al...which is also near there and all these names are very long, aslongas_——— German. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Now today all this is Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I must say that there also... know that there are <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in or in in I have read...I have read a great lot about uh the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Never read anything, heard anything about these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and I know some of these camps disappeared from the surface of the earth when people disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">They were perhaps buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">There must be plenty of places in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or in this <span class="REGION">area</span> where there are <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> and never been who is there, who was buried there. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Uh I want to mention two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Now when we worked or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauerhutte</span> , we had to march there from the camp in which we were, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauerhutte</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">One day we saw British prisoners of war passing us and shouting at us and it turned out these were Jewish soldiers who had volunteered from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> into the Bristish army, had been taken prisoner by the German. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">They were threatened to be sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> until the British government told them, told the German that if they are not treated like British...British soldiers, the British will take retaliatory measures, so the Germans separated them but treated them like prisoners of war according to the Geneva Convention. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">They knew we were marching till the next day in the evening so when the pass us, they threw us packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">The other thing I want to mention is we had to march through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> of when we marched to these <span class="NPIP">places</span> , to these <span class="BUILDING">work places</span> , and one day we were attacked by the...by the Hitler youths. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">You know, we were marching there and were attacked by the Hitler youths...dirty Jews, Jews, Jews, Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And the SS...there was SS...now how was SS there? </span><span class="sentence" id="490">There was SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">There was SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there was supervisory SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">The SS considered us their prisoners and nobody was supposed to do us anything, so they started to fight the Hitler youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Uh with there, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauerhutte</span> until the year 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Work was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Food was insufficient. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Uh people died from exhaustion or because they were beaten to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">There is also this which I have to say and this was much more...more more permanent and later on in the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> I have been...you know, when the...when...when the war...when we had to march into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> many people were sick or dying or injured and we had to the extent possible, we had to to drag them so all these marches looked like uh...how should I say...I mean, it was not...it was supernatural what you could see, what and it was very difficult to help people back. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And from time to time there were selections, particularly these prisoners were sent out because they couldn't work but we didn't quite understand why that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Uh but we did understand because I want to say now at the end of our stay in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauerhutte</span> , we had a very good Polish master. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">We worked in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> under German masters or Polish masters and we were watched and guarded by by these uh SR or whatever they were, and 1t was known that we would uh be transferred and he thought we would be sent to the gas and so he was very kind and sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">He gave us cigarettes and then one day we were...we were transferred in August of 1943 and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blechhammer</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauerhutte</span> was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> it was an outside camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blechhammer</span> was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="506">There were five thousand people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blechhammer</span> and it was Auschwitz No. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">III. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I have as I said before I have read a lot about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and the Holocaust, and I think there is no clarity about the number of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> about the number...the the the number assigned to certain camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">There was Auschwitz I which was...which was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz work camp</span> which was a horrible <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz II</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">That was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> , so not everybody that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> was exterminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">There were people who were for weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> and instead of going to the gas, they were sent to work, and then there were...was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz III</span> , and to my knowledge that was the camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blechhammer</span> , uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buna</span> (ph)...there's another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp...</span> there were further camps having...having the...having the...
QUESTION:  Linda's saying don't worry about the details but to go on with your own story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blechhammer</span> , after a short period where we were guarded by the German army and the German shouldn't say the army didn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">We were guarded by the German regular German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Then we were guarded by the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Uh there 1s a very good book by who wrote....
QUESTION:  I don't think...they they don't want this kind of detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">They want your own story. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Go on with your own personal story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">ANSWER:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Now, uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blechhammer</span> ...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blechhammer</span> was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">In the later part of the existence of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blechhammer</span> , there were not only Jewish there. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">There were French, French resistance fi...non-Jewish French resistance fighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">There were homosexuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">There were uh Jehovah's Witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">There were criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Gypsies...I don't believe there were gypsies there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">QUESTION:  Can you talk about the uniforms and the numbers and the....
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And uh uh...always every...everybody had the well-known uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I don't know how we could stand with this the winter with this uniform because when it was cold, it didn't give us any any any warmth. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Didn't protect us. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Uh gave us...we didn't possess a comb. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">We didn't possess a toothbrush. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">We didn't possess soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Some people...I I had an old...a can, a can and I just...I could get my soup, and I also had...I don't know from where I had it...a spoon, but there were people who had nothing of this, so they would get their food in a big washing...wash dish for let's say six people, and now imagine how can you get your food...how can you fish out part of the soup and the potatoes...there were potatoes in it...1f you have no instrument, you know, utensil to take it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">These people quarreled, didn't get what was their due, and uh many of them died of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Uh we worked...we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we got up in the summer at five o'clock...no, in the summer at four or three o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">In the winter later and we worked from six in the morning to six in the evening, twelve hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">We worked on various jobs and the type of job you had depended...determined very much your your your fate because if you had a heavy job, it was exhausting and you were exposed to beatings. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">If you had a relatively light job, you were exempt from this. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">You were not exposed to this and I must say in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blechhammer</span> I worked on construction work, but I was able to make it and then then I had light...light work, and the last job I had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blechhammer</span> was...there were...there there were...and there were...all the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were broken from bombings and so we had to fit in uh cardboards where the the glass had been. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I must tell you that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blechhammer</span> was one of the <span class="BUILDING">German factories</span> where oil, petrol, gasoline was derived from coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">It was one of the most important <span class="BUILDING">German factories</span> and there were a few of such <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> , in <span class="REGION">central Germany</span> , and there, and at the end when the Germans lost uh <span class="DLF">Romanian oil fields</span> , they were of of utmost strategic importance and I'll tell you later on about the bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Uh how should I systematize Blechhammer. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I've told you about uh there being various nationalities, and uh we had to walk about two, three miles...no, two, three kilometers to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">We had to get up very, very early. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Uh the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> employed twenty-five thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Among them were five thousand Germans who were free workers, a small number of French and Czech workers who were free workers who were only obliged to work there, and a great number of slaves of uh various degrees, prisoners of war, English prisoners of war, French prisoners of war, Yugoslav prisoners of war and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Uh so in the morning, you could...it was an incredible picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">You could see...it was still dark...you could see from all <span class="NPIP">sides</span> the people marching towards the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and uh we were surrounded on both sides by the SS which had like long whips with which their...and machine guns uh and uh in the morning we had the appell...the the the what you call the roll call in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">If somebody felt sick during the the appell, he was already counted, they tried to force him to march out with us, so we had to drag him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">When we left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the music was playing. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">When we came back the music was playing. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">They were inmates, the musicians. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Uh now I want to tell you one story which was important...important... _ spoke recently here of the hidden children. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">The head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the Jewish head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the lageraltester he was called, was Mr. Demera (ph) who had managed to bring a five year old child, his son, into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> he was afraid that his son would taken...would be taken away from him and sent to the gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Now the Polish Jews had learned that each SS occupied a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish village</span> or a Jewish place, and would divide the population into two groups, women and old people and children on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and men on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , men being expected to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And after they had learned this, uh they did the following. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">They tried to hide boys, not girls, boys among the men in the group where the men were standing and it so happened that in the course of time, more and more children came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I think at the end...not at the end...at the point which I am now talking about...there were some thirty children and Demera, the lageraltester, the head of the of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the Jewish head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> was afraid that his child and his children who were badly...who were well treated, they had enough to eat...the Germans gave them enough to eat, but that they would would be gassed, so he persuaded...uh he told the SS look...we have the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">They're not working. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I mean they're parasites. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">We need to have children, the children work. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And a column was created, a kommando was created, consisting only of children. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">The kapo was Mr. Klepich (ph) from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , the deputy kapo was Mr. Bornstein (ph) from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ...I knew them well...I happened to know them well...and for some reason which I cannot recall, I had...I was thrown out of my kommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">It was a bad work...I don't know what I did, and nobody wants to have me in his kommando, so being during the roll call pushed from one...one kommando to the other, I landed at the children's kommando which had the first day...which was...had it's first day, and since I knew that the the the kapo and his deputy, they took me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I don't know what right they had to take me in but I had somebody else to throw me out or push me out from their kommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I was with the children's kommando, and so we walked on this day...that was in October 1943...with the children to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Now the children...the SS on both sides with its sticks and with whips and its machine guns and all the five thousand people in this ___ this way and the thirty children. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Now when we met the other prisoners, the French prisoners, the British prisoners, everybody started to shout and to to whistle and to call shame on the Germans and the SS itself was embarrassed and they did react, so we walked with the children to our assigned <span class="BUILDING">working place</span> and there somebody uh uh a kapo appeared and said the children have to do the following. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">There are stones on this side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and they have to bring the stones to the other side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and he disappeared and we were alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And some of the children started to work and took the stones and brought them to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and other children knew that they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">They were between six and twelve years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Whatever the little boy and a charming little boy called Malich (ph) and he didn't recognize that he was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">He wanted to play, so when we came to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and the other children were...brought stones from one <span class="NPIP">side</span> to the other, he played. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">He played. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">He had...there was a broken down machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">It was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> or something...a steam engine. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">He played there, and suddenly there came a young SS man whom I had never seen and he liked this boy and he started to play with Malich and then he started to carve out of wood which was laying around, little things which he...little toys and gave it to to Malich and then he said to me, isn't it a pity. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Such a nice boy, but he is Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">He must die. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Now the children's column had no tragic end I have to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">After a while the children gave up carrying the

QUESTION:  Sheets of what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Sheets of tin. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Sheets of tin. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">We didn't realize that this was considered uh scarce material.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">QUESTION:  Uh Linda's asking me to ask you to start that sentence all over...when they were asked to load sheets of tin...so we don't have the interruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">ANSWER:  One day we were...we were asked to load sheets of tin which were in front of a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and transport them to another <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , so we loaded a few of these sheets on this little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> and started to walk towards the other <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , and suddenly we heard behind us, sabotage, sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">In the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , there was not only the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">There was what was called Factory Gestapo, Work Gestapo, and they had noticed that we had loaded this, and they noticed that we transported it and behind the Gestapo came SS man. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">You dirty Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">You traitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">You...and they started to shout sabotage, sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And that was a very good example. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I mean in general, , generally they beat us why. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Because we didn't work uh fast enough or we did something which was quite normal for which one was not supposed to be punished, but here we had really transported something which really not supposed to transport, so they started to shout and more and more came after us and started to shout hang them, hang them. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And they brought us to the outer perimeter of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">The <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was surrounded by wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">It was not uh barbed wire, and this wire was on cement uh...what do you call...what do you call it...uh what would you call this uh...
QUESTION:  Pole.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="645">ANSWER:  Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">On cement poles which were bent. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Whenever I...you see them all over here, <span class="DLF">garden</span> , and there was the wire on it so when a...<span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="648">There was a <span class="DLF">fence</span> and the <span class="DLF">fence</span> was in cement posts, so whenever I see such a pole, I have to remember the story I'm telling you now. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And more and more people came and I don't know how many were there...perhaps seven, perhaps ten people. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">They brought us there and they put wire on these poles in order to hang us and I must say we had a...I think all of us had a very strange reaction. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">We didn't believe the reality of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">However, perhaps we didn't believe the reality of this because while the SS started and...you know, they they put the wires on and they pushed us to these poles, while they did this, the Gestapo...which was after all the Gestapo was more careful, and behind the Gestapo came the management of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> who had been alerted and they came and started...they were very careful...that they started to plead, not on our behalf. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">On behalf of uh the workers who had given us the order because the workers had done something illegal first of all to tell us to transport this which they had no right to tell us. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Not...anybody could tell us anything but they had not the right and number two, it turned out but that I understood only later that they wanted to steal this in order to use it for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">They made iron uh irons for the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="656">There was a scarcity of iron , you know, and they used this. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">They used this uh uh...they used this as the steel plates, so the management came and uh more and more people started to argue, but they started to argue because the workers would have been accused of sabotage, even if they had hanged us and number two, according to this strange system of justice which prevailed there, you couldn't hang somebody without the order of Himmler. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">There was no order signed by Himmler. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">So after a long and we were in a very strange state I think all of us, they started to beat us and to slap us and chased us away and that was the end of the story, and we, however, were afraid that we would be hanged nevertheless because when people were hanged, they didn't...for instance this Johnson who had found the powder, he didn't know that he was sentenced to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">They had his number and they called all the people together and would uh...they could...they called all the people together and suddenly would read...his first name was Sam Johnson...uh number so and so...sentence death for sabotage, so we were afraid for for many weeks thereafter that we would be called...that there would be another hanging and then they would call us and say we are sentenced to death, so we got out of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">But it was not only an extraordinary experience, very extraordinary experience...I think there are a few people who considered under the gallows but walk today. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Now it's difficult to give you other highlights if there are other highlights in the life of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but I must say, our enemies were the SS, hunger... even so we were much better fed than the County Vernet. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">We were working hard and even if we were not working hard, I mean sixteen hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I mean I tried to work as little as possible but still uh so there was hu...the SS was the main enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">There was hunger and there was a short thing and that was the bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">The bombing came...came later. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Uh this was one of the most strategic <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and when the Allies had advanced far enough in <span class="REGION">northern Italy</span> so that they could fly from <span class="REGION">northern Italy</span> to <span class="REGION">Upper Salasia</span> and back, they started to bomb.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Linda's saying we don't have time for this story. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">We'll wait until the tape changes. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Linda, what would you like him to...(pause)...oh, OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Oh, OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">She said this is going to be the end of the tape, so would you talk about hiding when everybody left on the death march.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="674">ANSWER:  Let me say one thing whether it's on the tape or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">This bombing is important to be mentioned because at this...1n this connection, they bombed deliberately or not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I and the whole story about why have <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> not been bombed...it has been bombed and I know witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I have...1 mean <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> bombed...that was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz III</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And uh uh the second thing I want to say about this bombing, it's ridiculous to say they should bomb the the the the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">We worked on the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">You can...if they were destroyed or damaged, you could have restored them in a couple of days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">QUESTION:  Please talk about hiding when the death marches came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">ANSWER:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Uh on the fourteenth of January, 1945, the Russian offensive started and that was I think from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> towards the __, and we knew that contrary to the landing of the of the of the of of the Allies in <span class="REGION">western Europe</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> or some other Russian victories, this time it's us. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">This offensive means that they will reach us. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there was never any resistance movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">There couldn't be any resistance movement, but at this time people said you have to resist because there are so many possibilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Either they will run away and the Russians will come and save us or they will uh...they will kill all of us and then run away, or they will evacuate us and we have to resist being killed or being evacuated but that was logically correct but we...there was no possibility of of of resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I mean they had the machine guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">They had the weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">We had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">We couldn't...we couldn't prevail over them, so uh we say it but that was some consolation in which we didn't believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">If we are evacuated...no...we didn't know what to what to say, and finally on the...well, the the battle came near. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">We heard the guns and these were the guns of liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">We knew this...over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">These were ominous guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">These were the liberators or we are...we are dying, and uh then we heard...I think it was the eighteenth of January, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I is being evacuated and uh the evacuees marched towards...are being marched towards the west, and on the eighteenth or nineteenth of January, some five thousand uh...some five thousand <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">eastern camps</span> came into into uh Blechhammer...into into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="697">They were exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Some of them were dying or they they fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">We didn't know whether they're dying or not, and the next day the order was given that we should be evacuated and then I said to myself...then we said among us OK, we are going to march together and then we are going to run away, if we can, but when they started to evacuate I had second thoughts and I said, now or never. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I'm not going to be evacuated but I didn't know what to do, and walking through the...they pushed people towards the <span class="BUILDING">roll call place</span> uh square and you could see once you were in the crowd, you were surrounded by the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">You couldn't get out of this, and I started to try to stay <span class="NPIP">outside</span> but suddenly an SS man, an SS man caught me and shouted I should go to the <span class="BUILDING">roll call place</span> and he had two hand grenades and he always threatened he would...he would throw them at me, but I knew...I didn't run. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">He started...run, run, run. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I didn't run because I knew if he threw it at me, he would be...he would be hit too by his own grenade, so he pushed me towards the crowd. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">He didn't push me in and again I got out of this cro...out of the perimeter...of the peripheral of the crowd and I tried to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide and I found another uh man whom I knew from uh from Vernet who was also out looking for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide, and we came to the <span class="INT_SPACE">sick bay</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">sick bay</span> was separated from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">You could only go in if if a certain <span class="DLF">gate</span> was opened and there was...there was a man standing whom I hated. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I hated him because he had been a male nurse called...kind of male nurse to the people who were dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">He wasn't much of a male nurse but he was part of the inmate...he was an inmate. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">He was stealing their bread, and I guess he felt that I didn't like him, but coming to this <span class="DLF">gate</span> together with my buddy, he said do you want to come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">We said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">So he opened the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and this is...we want to get into hiding, but not with the sick, and he said there's an empty <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , so we came to a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and he opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="711">It seemed to be full of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="712">I don't know where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Full of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="714">It seemed you cannot get in, but when we investigated more closely, we found it wasn't so full and we entered this this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">On the other side of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , there was a little <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">There we made room for ourselves, my buddy and I and then there was a third person whom...a young boy who had been entrusted to him but not a child anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">He was fourteen, fifteen years. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">There were hiding so we made a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> and then we arranged the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> ...where they came from I don't know...in such a way that if you opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> ...

<p><span class="sentence" id="723">ANSWER:  Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">The people who had remained in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> were the people who had come on the first hunger march...some of them remained in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> perhaps two thousand, discovered that there were <span class="BUILDING">food barracks</span> ...there were <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> full of food, magazines, and started to attack them and tried to get in to get food and they were repelled by the SS which uh shot many of them and many of them were in front of our little <span class="DLF">window</span> and we saw them , laying there and some had friends who brought them back and others were laying there and after a while uh these attacks repeated themselve and the SS shot again and this became crescendo, always stronger and stronger and then there came a general offensive from the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">They shot the right and the left, and the left and the right and many people were killed or wounded and then came a cry, the SS left, and then came however shouting they have...they have uh put fire on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and indeed we saw some of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> burning and now we had felt pretty secure in our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Now we saw we would have to leave our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , but we were in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the fire died down. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">The SS had left and uh my friend uh crawled over the...over the uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> and then he shouted when he came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> , be careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">You cannot open the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="729">The <span class="DLF">door</span> is not...you cannot easily open the <span class="DLF">door</span> , so after he had left I came. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">You know, I had my blanket and I had some bread and and I came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and I couldn't open it and I put...I pushed myself and I opened it a little bit and there was a heap of dead people, of corpses as high as that. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I don't know...you know, we had...that's why I stressed we didn't see all...all what has happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Somebody must have brought dead people, corpses there and the only way I could get across it was to crawl over them. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And then we were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was burning...was still burning and now we discovered the the...the open...the open <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> but we discovered something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">We discovered a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> full of children's...children's and women's underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Children wear and underwear...that must have some from the gas, from the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">It was full of them and it was very very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Very, very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">The liberated people behaved like ani...some of them behaved like animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">They were eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">They were cooking. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">They were making uh their needs. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">It it...like animals and the fires were burning, you know, and then they took from this...from this magazine where there was children's wear and women's underwear, they took, for instance, a bra and, you know, to protect their head because it was very, very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">It was really pandemonium. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Suddenly there were women there. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">I had never seen women before there. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">There were women there and a woman came to me and said I should help her to to find her sister who had been killed somewhere in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , so I went with her and we entered a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and there was a group of people sitting and eating and eating and eating and we said have you seen that woman here. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">They said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And I opened...there there was a...what you call it...where they put things in a...

<p><span class="sentence" id="750">ANSWER:  Closet. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">Opened a <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> and the body of this woman fell out and I said who put them...who put her in there, and they said we. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Can you imagine...how can you eat with a dead person around you. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Well, to make the story short, we were there...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was surrounded by the battle between the Russians and the Germans and after some adventures to which I don't want to go into now, on the Thursday...the whole story started on a Saturday...Sunday the SS left I think on Monday or on Sunday...on the following Thursday, we had moved into a little little <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> which had been a workshop. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">There were...there were hammers there and so on, and uh we were three in this...we heard shouts at midnight and uh this friend of mine, this colleague of mine believed the Russians uh have come. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">He spoke Polish and hardly any Russian but he tried to find some Russian words and said finally, finally you are here, finally you come, and we heard from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , out, out, out, you damn...the Germans were back. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And uh this little <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where we had been, now the little workshop was somehow on the side and this German soldier came and knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and said out, out. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">We were quiet and we had...there were some hammers there. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">If he had entered, we would have killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">I think the first and only time in my life...we would have killed him and for us it was a terrible feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">We had believed...we had believed we are free, and here they were again. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">He was afraid to enter. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">He was afraid to enter and uh he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Then they took some of those people who had still been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ...not all of them...along and they shot them <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and we said to ourselves we cannot stay here any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">We have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">So the next morning, the battle was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">We left through the main <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="767">We saw the SS a couple of hundred yards away and we run into a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="768">We run through this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and we came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was the village of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blechhammer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Before we came there, we saw some dead uh inmates who had done the same thing as we. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Somebody shot them, and as we came into the main <span class="DLF">street</span> of uh this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , we saw British prisoners of war running through the main <span class="DLF">street</span> and French prisoners of war and other prisoners, former obviously prisoners so we run with them and run and run and suddenly were Russians soldiers and they run further and we were free.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="771">QUESTION:  The SS didn't make any attempt to stop you as you ran out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="772">ANSWER:  No, because they were engaged with the Russians, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">We were secondary at this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="774">QUESTION:  Linda, what would you like to ask? (</span><span class="sentence" id="775">Pause - Linda talking). </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Linda would like you talk very briefly about where you went after liberation, how you met Linda again and how you got to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Elizabeth...I'm sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">After liberation, we went uh...I went first uh to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chesta</span> ...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chestahova</span> (ph) but the Russians had even uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">repatriation camp</span> , but they were incapable of organizing it and uh from there I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krackow</span> and uh we walked to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krackow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="780">It was deep winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">It was very cold, and we always went to peasants and asked for the possibility of sleeping there and they always gave us food. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">They didn't have much themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krackow</span> , there was such famine that we decided...that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krackow</span> , there was...yeah...there was such famine that we decided foolishly...I say we...there was a boy from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , there were always other...other people we were with. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">We are going across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Now that was completely foolish. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">How could we go across...in winter across very high <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="787">It turned out that we hadn't realized there was a <span class="DLF">wall</span> there which was not high enough and we walked through this <span class="DLF">wall</span> and we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="788">We came to <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="789">There we met Jewish people who had been hidden and they helped us and from there we went very slowly as the Russians moved westward, we moved westward and at the end of April, at the beginning of May we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> and was back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brun</span> and my...the the boys we went with me went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and it was the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">I stayed one year still in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">I had a very uneasy feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">You had...it was the beginning of Communism, but it wasn't yet Communism. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">It was democratic. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">But there were many arbitrary things happening and I had a feeling you cannot stay here, so...and uh shortly after having arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , I got in touch with Elizabeth indirectly. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I learned she was alive and in 19...so I stayed still one year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="796">I studied in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="797">I didn't study much but I went to the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> , and in 1946 I got a three-day British transit visa to go to go via <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="798">While...my daughter was in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> and she got this transit visa for three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">The British were very decent. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Out of the three days, there were one and a half years. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And then Elizabeth came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="802">We married in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">She being an American citizen could claim me outside the quota because at this time it was very difficult to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="804">You were on a quota which depended on your place of birth. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Since my place of birth was <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , the quota was over filled...overfull, and so in uh in February 1948 I came with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> called Ernie Pyle to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> while there was big __—__ and I got a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">I started immediately to to register at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I worked during the day and in the evening I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="808">I made my MA in 1950. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">I went to <span class="BUILDING">Johns Hopkins University</span> where I was junior instructor for one year, and then I felt I have enough of <span class="BUILDING">academia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="810">I need a job and since <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Johns Hopkins</span> was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="811">I got a job in the Treasury but I would have had to wait for two months to start the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">I got a temporary job in the Department of Agriculture and I never left. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Well, I left after thirty-nine years. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">I worked in the Department for eight years until '59 and in '59 I went overseas to first to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where I was at the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> , then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> where I was for ten years Agricultural Attache to the Common Market, a year's mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">Then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> where I was in the big trade negotiations called the Tokyo __, the head of the agricultural delegation, of the American agricultural delegation. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Then I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="817">Then I was assigned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> as Counselor at the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> and then I came back and after a couple of years I resigned...I retired last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="818">QUESTION:  Good. (</span><span class="sentence" id="819">cough) Thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">Linda wants to go back over something. (</span><span class="sentence" id="821">Long pause - Linda talking in background.) </span><span class="sentence" id="822">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">She would like you to go back to the story where you were almost hanged and try to talk a little bit more about what you were feeling at the time...she said as a young person to be faced with this, and just...if you can give us a little more...
ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">Uh the feeling was blank because I mean we were all the time, all the time...
QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">Start...start from....the...like that that little story. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">Make a separate little story. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Can you...she wants you in other words to go back and say you were almost hanged...I was almost hanged because...
ANSWER:  Well, uh shall I describe how they put us under under this pole, cement pole...
QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="828">ANSWER:  We were under the cement poles and I didn't quite believe it was happening and I think my colleagues who were with me had the same feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">It was the unbelievable and it was strange that it was an unbelievable feeling because we had been confronted so often before in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with the...with the...with the threat of death. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">Perhaps it was...we we didn't...we we refused mentally and psychologically to accept it because when we had been confronted with the danger or with the risk of being killed, it was just a risk, but here it was so to speak an ultimate risk and this ultimate risk seemed to be unacceptable, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">There was no hope that when you are hanged...when they start to hang you, uh then then you are dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">That it was...at the other occasions there was always a chance even if you were wounded or injured, to to escape somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">So uh it was not the feeling which has been described 1n literature...I saw my whole life before eyes...it 1t it was the opposite of a supreme moment subjectively. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">Objectively it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">You know, it's like...J am sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I have to go back to the bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">I was more or less I would say courageous but I was afraid of the bombs and sometimes I had...I was panic...I was panicky in spite of the fact that objectively was not as dangerous then as other occasions where it was more dangerous and I was less afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">As a matter of fact, in my recollection of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , this episode with the hanging was for a long time in the background. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">I refused even to internally to invoke it. (</span><span class="sentence" id="840">Pause)
QUESTION:  Linda, 1s it...right. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Is there anything else you would like to speak about, anything that you recall now before we end?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="843">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">I I mean there are many, many other things but I think I have given the gist...perhaps I remember afterwards some...
QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">Well, I'm sure...uh also you had said at one point that people usually tried to help one another but sometimes they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">Was there a specific incident that you had in mind that you wanted to talk about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="847">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">What I mean with helping...everybody...everybody was helpless and so people quite naturally uh had each other...except, of course, the kapos. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">You know, that's a very sad story and very little is said about the kapos because the kapos were traitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">The kapos beat us and the kapos made our life miserable and some...and some of the kapos killed even, and they were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Now if...there is no excuse to...for to say that they were forced to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">They were not forced. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">I could have been a kapo too. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">I think would have lasted two days or a day, but they were not forced to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">True, they improved their fate. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">They had the chance...they they increased the chance of survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">That is true, but they were not forced. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">There is no moral excuse and it's quite interesting that nobody speaks about this and it was not the same as the, as the...you know, in the in the so-called Judenrat (ph) when the Germans asked them to assign people for a transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">What should they have done? </span><span class="sentence" id="860">They could assign or they were...they were going themselves, but the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span> , it was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">The kapos pushed us because they got more food. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">The kapos forced us to work hard and the kapos enforced us by beating us, and that's no glorious page in the Holocaust story and very little is said about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="863">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">You had also mentioned that the man with the stamps saved your life twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">I don't recall you talking about it a second time. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I remember you said that he brought you to his kommando and saved your life...
ANSWER:  Oh, twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Twice, because first of all he...he saw to it that I got a double ration of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">That was once and then I was in his column...in his kommando where he didn't...he didn't let me work I mean, so I recovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Incidentally, uh at the...at one point he started to shout at me...later on...shout at me and beat me, slapped me in front of everybody and I was quite , and threw me out of his kommando and two weeks later he had escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">He had disappeared, so that last service which he rendered to me was to to make it appear that he wasn't my friend so that nobody would do me anything, and uh a year later, you know, as newspapers were smuggled into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp...</span> we were not allowed to read anything but newspapers were smuggled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp...</span> I read that eight resistance fighters had been killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and one of them had the name of Stanislov Kubacheck. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I don't...it seems to...well, perhaps he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I think the Polish resistance helped him to escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="873">QUESTION:  Good. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">Good. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Linda, is that it? </span><span class="sentence" id="877">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">OK.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="879">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">You have given many interviews. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">You know, I have the experience and other have the experience, if you talk to survivors who had the same experience, it's stimulates recollection.</span></p>
