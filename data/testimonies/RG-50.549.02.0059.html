QUESTION:  And we are both sitting on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">That’s nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">So, I should say that you survived the ghetto in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">You were transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , where you stayed for just a little while.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  Correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Then you went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp --</span> a working ca -- a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration working camp</span> in --
ANSWER:  First --
QUESTION:  -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  And what was it called again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  First I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , and then I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zazel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  Oh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zazel</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for awhile.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  And then you went to Bergen-Belsen death camp, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  That’s correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  And I would like to ask you, around the time -- and you were liberated from -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  Correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  Speak a little bit about the time just before liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">What was it like for you, what state of mind were you in? </span><span class="sentence" id="17">What was your -- your health at that time? </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Where were you? </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And then, when liberation happened, what was that like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Actually, when the liberation happened, I didn’t feel any ela-elation, because I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I was still lying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of something which looked like a very big <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">There were still mountains of skeletons around me, and the skeletons were actually people, who were once human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And then, also, you could see people with diarrhea, with typhus, running aimlessly to the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> and back. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So, nothing changed, in a way, and so what I did, I was lying on this <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Somehow I got pencil and paper, and I did writing, and writing, and writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I wish I kept those papers, but I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Anyhow, we would --
QUESTION:  How did it -- how did it happen though? </span><span class="sentence" id="29">You were in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Yeah, it was -- it -- I was in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , and they were saying that the English army is approaching, and they -- we should not go to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> too early, because we might be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">So we -- but -- and they opened the <span class="DLF">gates</span> , and -- and came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Probably, when you have been incarcerated for such a long time, you cannot switch. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Anyhow, in my case, besides that -- at that moment, actually -- maybe not exactly that moment, I realized that I'll never see my parents again, because there was no way for them to survive these horrors. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So, in a way, I started thinking about my family, and I started thinking about all these people who perished, and this writing probably was a way to put my feelings into papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Now, I was, all this time, in the -- actually, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> too, but we didn’t have much of a -- we didn’t see each other quite often, but I was with my cousin, René Berlinska. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We met at the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were supposed to board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and we stayed -- we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> together, and we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And we survived together. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So I actually, when they took us and -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zazel</span> , I had a feeling that we are going to a camp where we won’t come out alive, so I jumped out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , but fortunately they did -- they picked me up, and I was expecting afterwards that I will be punished, but I wasn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Probably, among this Nazi girls, there was already awareness that the war is being lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So, that -- not always stopped them, and Pll tell you later, for instance, with my husband, who was -- who was liberated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aren</span> , close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> , the SS loaded them on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and brought them someplace where they asked the Wehrmarkt to shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">However, the Wehrmarkt say, “We are soldiers, we don’t shoot people.” </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And this way, 19 people were saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Now we -- so we were moved to some <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> which -- my cousin believes they were <span class="BUILDING">army barracks</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , and the -- we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , with eight other girls, and they were wonderful girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">We are -- we always have been friends with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Now, I --
QUESTION:  Was that after -- was that already liberation, or was that still before liberation [indecipherable |
ANSWER:  No, all what I’m saying now, they -- the Germans wouldn’t have moved us. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">They -- I mean, they wanted to finish us off, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">But after the liberation, we have been transferred, so probably the very sick ones were, I assume, transferred to some ar -- to some -- something which was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> -- maybe a <span class="BUILDING">makeshift hospital</span> , but a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Unfortunately, in their goodness, the soldiers gave us food like chocolate, which we were not able to digest. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I probably -- I don’t know why -- they did not consume any of this, and they -- so it didn’t affect me, but as tragic as it is, some people who already had problems, got very, very sick.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  Who liberated you though? </span><span class="sentence" id="51">We haven’t said that yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  Yeah, woo -- I was liberated by the English army. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And the -- so, I mean, as I said again, they wanted to -- they knew that we are starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Now, they realized it pretty fast, that the food which we’ ll be able to digest is a different food than -- then they fed us the right food. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Now, when I was in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with the girls, which -- it’s amazing when I think about it, it seems that they were actually very comfortable <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> , because in comparison what was before, but my energy was coming back, and so I decided to go and get clothes, and I found out that there is some distribution point in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , and when I came back, I had a beautiful blue outfit, and I had also a hat, and I also brought some clothes for the girls with whom I was living.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  How did you -- how did -- how were you able to go to -- to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  I think it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">You know, I tried to -- I tried to think about it, and in fact, when I came back, I was -- it was so impressive to some people, they -- there was a younger man who wanted to marry me right away, and the -- my resourcefulness was coming back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So I didn’t -- I f -- I was fortunate in a way that one day when I looked out, I saw somebody approaching, and who was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="61">It was the venerable Mr. Klipp, and I shouted out, “Panya Klipp, Panya Klipp,” Panya is mister in Polish, and here he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">He used to be the -- the boss of the food supply in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">He was very respected, and he -- he was not only the head of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , but also the head of other departments, and -- however, I remember one thing, which we -- I shouldn’t maybe say, that I had diarrhea. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So I went to him, and wanted some rice. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And he somehow refused to give it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And what was happening, he was an- he was an unusual person with in -- impeccable integrity, and so he was allowed to have additional rations of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">He didn’t accept that til his -- til his wife’s sister -- no, it was his own sister, his own sister, was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So, of course, I was very happy to see him, it’s just like seeing somebody from the previous life, and he was -- he was liberated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Arlen</span> , as I mentioned before, and he was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I actually was hoping that my brother Hershlite Feingarten, whom we called Lolec, survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">He was only one and a half year older than I, and he was extremely capable, and if he would have survived, he would have been a famous engineer, because as a child, he took apart our grandfather’s clock, and put it together, and since he was missing a part, he used a string, and that fa -- gar -- grandfather’s clock was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Now, I also was hoping that Aroush, our adopted cousin, when he -- he was 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with his parents -- now, first his father was departed, then his mother was deported, and then we did adopt him, and my mother [indecipherable] from a skin disease, and my father got the skin disease, I must have mentioned it on my other tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  That was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  That was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , right. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Anyhow, he was, unfortunately -- okay, I never found my brother, and I never found Aroush, but I found out that my brother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , and people actually saw him very shortly before the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">However, I looked for him, and I couldn’t find him. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Neither did I find Aroush. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And Aroush -- I remember when Aroush was born, the joy, and the festivities were absolutely wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We were celebrating for a whole week, and the -- the whole family was just elated. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Now we -- I mentioned that Dave was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> when I was in my quest to look for Lolec and Aroush, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> , I worked afterwards 1n a -- in a dep -- ina <span class="NPIP">place</span> where a -- there was a representation of UNRRA, U-N-N-R -- I think they said W- A, which means United Nations relief, and we were distributing food. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So I worked there for a time, and there I had the honor to meet Mayor LaGuardia. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">He was working for UNRRA, and he was visiting the <span class="BUILDING">distribution centers</span> , so I have a picture of him, and -- and when we were talking to him, you could see in his expression the horror, and the unbelief in his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">He just stopped for awhile, and just looked really very, very unpleasantly impressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  So, he had only limited information of what -- what had happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Probably, because the -- I will show you the pictures, and you can see from his face that he just couldn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I guess, judging from the words of Eisenhower, he says he has to document it, because nobody, but nobody would believe it, what they did to so many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And the -- so, it is really very difficult to comprehend. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Now, as the time passes by, to tell you the truth, it’s much more for me to comprehend how all this was possible, and the -- in fact, it -- fortunately, I am very busy, but the pictures, let’s say, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , they are always -- anyhow, quite frequently, very vividly in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And now, when I was making that tape, I didn’t mention that a person whom I approach to ask for my mother, going on my side of the <span class="DLF">line</span> , which meant work, I didn’t realize then that it meant life, 1t was Mengele, and the -- in my husband’s ta -- tape, it’s mentioned that it was Mengele. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Now, we are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Wh-Why was it -- why was it that you went in your search for your family to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> , because there are -- were more resources to find -- wa --
ANSWER:  No, at that time -- at that time, we did not have a registry yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">You know, it was just by talking to people, which I did, so I was told that they saw him, so my hopes were really up, but it -- all the search which I made, was 1n vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  What -- what time was that now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  That was still 1945, because we were liberated in -- I believe it was April. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">It was still 19 fa -- it was very shortly after, I just started the search right -- right after. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Now, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> , Dave, shortly after, I don’t know the exact date, Dave realized that the refugees are just lost, and h-he contacted the German authorities to -- to organize some facilities where we can get food rations, where they -- we can get <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> , when the -- when we can get directions. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And he was quite successful, thanks to his mastery of the German language, he was -- til the last minish he was able to write a letter in German, really beautifully, and without mistakes, I was always very impressed with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And he also had a businessman’s background. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So, he organized that, and it functioned for quite awhile, and it was an enormous help. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So, I was living -- you know, 1t was much nicer living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">There were also many refugees there, many survivors, and they -- of course there was Dave, who was only 17 years older than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">However, with his energy, and his equanimity, and his wonderful attitude towards people, chronologically there was a difference, but in energy level, and in zest of life, we -- actually was none. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So, we did get married, and we got married on March 16, 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Most of the survivors in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> were - | would say, were at the wedding, and who officiated over that ceremony was an elderly man who was from German origin, and -- and he was really qualified to -- to conduct the ceremony. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And the -- I have, of course, pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I have the pictures of the other survivors who attended the wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Now what -- of course, we wanted to -- to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and the <span class="NPIP">destination</span> was very easy for us to decide, because Dave’s -- Dave knew that he has a sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , but Dave was liberated by the Americans, and one of the American army personnel promised him to get in touch with his sister, which he did, and we started even receiving letters from her, and of course our <span class="NPIP">destination</span> , because of that, was to go and join his sister, her husband, and they had a -- a son who was going to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , studying accounting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  Can I ask you two -- two -- two question? </span><span class="sentence" id="109">What was -- what were the conditions in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time, in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  In the beginning -- now, we -- we actually did not expect much, considering our past. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Now we were giving food through the <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> , then, of course, is a -- many people were living on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oberstrasser</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oberstrasser</span> was the seat of -- before the war, that was the Yiddish geminda, which means like stat the council -- the council of the -- and, so --
QUESTION:  The <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  No, n-not the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> , the council. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Stat --
QUESTION:  The council, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  The council.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  And the -- so it was the Yiddish geminda, and the -- well, these <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> were available to the refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And then once these facilities were establish, which my husband was happy to establish, then we also were able to get <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> with some German families. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And we also were able to get food rations, and the -- so life became more livable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  Was it difficult though, to live with German people, so shortly after --
ANSWER:  See, that is a very interesting question. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We didn’t want to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because we didn’t know who, of the people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , was instrumental in this horrors. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">However, the German people have a way of being very hospitable. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And you would never believe that this people were able to do what they did, or being bystanders, and not relac - react. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So1--
QUESTION:  So, they were quite nice to you then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Oh, some, some. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">But we never knew when we spoke to them, or have been with them, what their background is. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So, of course, most of the people -- for instance there was Pater Dana, who was a German, and became a great friend of my husband’s, and he -- and there were other people who became friends of my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I mean, he -- David Klipp had a fantastic personality, and just -- people just loved him. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Everybody who -- whom he touched, loved him and respected him. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So, there were some German people who -- who even used to come later on, when we had a better living he -- <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> that they are -- actually came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Now to -- to answer your question, that’s -- that’s why never occurred to ask to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And in -- where are we actually? </span><span class="sentence" id="133">We are -- okay, so Dave is -- was working, he was very busy in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and --
QUESTION:  What did you -- what did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  I was also busy, I was working from yo -- in the other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and also in the -- our first child, Philip Klipp was born in 19 four -- wait a second, we <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> -- he was born in 1947, oh yeah, that’s right, 1947, June eight. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And that was absolutely the greatest joy, because it was, in a way, a miracle, because we were suspecting that we were getting something in the food which will prevent us from being able to bear children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  Yeah, is -- 1-1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , or maybe -- probably it would have been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">S-So we -- now, about the -- we wanted to, of course, emigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Now, I used to have in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I had pleurisy, which is water -- water on the lungs, and when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , actually, I had still water on the lungs, I had swollen legs, and I had a blood infection. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And, believe it or not, that after we spent the first night in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , I awoke and I didn’t have the blood infection. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I still have the -- had the swollen legs, which was a big handicap when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , and I had to climb up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> which took us to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">The girls had to help me, and the pleurisy also lasted awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Now, what actually helped -- I moved, did I disturb anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  That’s fine, don’t worry about it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Somehow, even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the mother of Aroush, which I mentioned before, we were not really doing a lot of visiting, there was no time for that, and there was -- it wasn’t an atmosphere where you just go visiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">But whenever I came to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , she was so happy, because I was full of hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">When I went to the krippo -- it’s kriminalpoisi, where many people didn’t come out alive, I went in, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">My mother was there already, my father was there already, and my brother was there already. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">But when I walked in and there was Souter, who was the head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- of the kriminalpoisi, sorry -- I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I was laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And he says, “Das laken vilderkil hafher gaya.” </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And I really did. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">However, there was something about it -- also, when in the -- still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , after the nateez -- Nazis came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , which they named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litzmanshtadt</span> afterwards, we were supposed to wear a yellow star, and I had a girlfriend, Gernia Finkelstein from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and she didn’t want to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I said, “Gernia, look. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We have nothing to be ashamed of. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Let the people who do it to us, let them be ashamed of it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I somehow -- I was also praying. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I usually pray in my own words, and as a child, I used to get up in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> - well, I figured that I shouldn’t do it in lying position, and I prayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And I remember in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , where we were in that camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , we had to get up very early, the stars were still on the firmament, and I looked at the stars. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">We had to line up so that we were chosen to go to work, and where to go to work, and I was standing there, and looking at the <span class="DLF">heavens</span> , and I was praying for myself, for my mother, my father, and my whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And now, it’s likely that prayer 1s very powerful, and it influences the body. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So that was -- my spirituality was also a reason, probably, which helped me to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Also, once, when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Zazel</span> , I brought some food from the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were working, and when I came back, I was being punished. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And the punishment was that I was supposed to clean the latrines. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And somehow, as -- in my recollection, I didn’t mind it a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Probably I was happy that I didn’t get a much, much more severe punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So, 1-1t -- it was the spirit, also I never, during the whole ordeal, felt inferior. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I always felt that they are doing it to us, but that we are not inferior. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I -- maybe should we talk now a little bit about anti-Semitism, or that’s not -- I’m actually very tolerant. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I feel that different expressions of religion, art, language -- are actually very beneficial to the culture of a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And teeb -- you f -- you sometimes find people saying that Jews cause anti- Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I -- but even among Jews you sometimes hear such a statement. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">It’s the -- in my mind, it is definitely, but definitely not the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Anti-Semitism is caused by other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Now, it is in the human nature that it’s easy to blame somebody, and it makes it easier to handle certain things, and sometimes even governments, in order to put the blame, either for some economical disasters or shortcomings, or other shortcomings, needed somebody to blame, and someone who is not protected, or whose rights can be taken away at will, is a -- is a scapegoat. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Because, when we look actually at what the Jewish people contribute to the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> where they were living, they s -- I would say that there is a reason to be anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Also, which 1s quite interesting, there is now anti-Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> where there are no Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , there are actually no Jews to be talked about, and they are very anti-Semitic, in spite of Pol -- of the Pope’s powel -- efforts to change it. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So, you -- we talk about the state of Israel, which historically, and when you look at the archaeology, and when you read the history, it is as -- 1t is the land of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And only having a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we will be protected, and there will be an action if there is anti-Semitism in whatever form, which has been before, like pogroms, like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , then there is somebody, we are not unprotected. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And by the same token, we might not be so -- such easy targets. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And besides that, there's the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the world where there is a law of rittem, and people can actually, if they are Jewish -- some who are not Jewish also, can come in, whether it is from <span class="COUNTRY">Ethiopia</span> , which used to be <span class="COUNTRY">Abyssinia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Whether it is from <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span> , whether it 1s from an-any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where -- where the conditions are fertile for anti-Semitism, there is a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">A-Also, I mean, of course, it’s not only si -- some people wish to go there for other reasons, of course the <span class="DLF">gates</span> are also open.</span></p>

ANSWER:  No, I will tell you what, we were just busy living. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Making a living, bringing up the children, thinking of the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">So, the 1939 Club, organization of the survivors, mostly from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , was organized quite early, which wa -- I was active for awhile there, and I have a picture, I will show it to you, where I’m being given a-award for that work. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Now, my husband, I will tell you later, was their treasurer for 17 years, and that was very helpful for the survivors, because in the beginning they were meeting in people’s <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Then, when the financial situation of the survivors was better, we were able to meet in a <span class="BUILDING">rented hall</span> , and finally there were many occasions, and we also had orchestra, and for awhile the Jewish Federation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> did not actually accept anybody from us as a member, which ch -- which changed completely right now, and we are very much respected, and they come to our affairs, and the -- that --
QUESTION:  What -- why did they not accept anybody as a member?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  It takes time for people to accept. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">It takes time, and you have to work for it, you have to show what you can do, you have to show what positions you have. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">You have to show how educated your children are, and many of us, you know, like Mr. Sam Goetz, became- you know, was educated and finished <span class="BUILDING">USC</span> , and was active there. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">His wife has a Masters in German, and there are other people who are librarians, and they were quite -- were highly educated.</span></p>

ANSWER:  I remember the saying that we would like to be on the board, and it took a long time, but the switch is absolutely amazing, because we -- now we are -- they are always representative of the Jewish Federation coming to our affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">We are donating to their causes, and things changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  But what was the perception?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  I could not tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">I could not tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I don’t actually blame them. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I think -- I think now, the attitude towards the Russian people who came -- of course, they were not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , they were not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , is already different, and they are -- the willingness to -- to help, is also greater, because now, since we are established, and since we are -- most of us anyhow, are doing well, and want to contribute both financially, and with our work, to our -- the Jewish community, and all the others, not Jewish causes, we are respected. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">You have to earn it, probably.</span></p>

ANSWER:  It started, actually, a social club, and there is a whole book about it, about the 1939 Club. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Now, maybe I should tell you now about -- what year was it, let me see. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Anyhow, my husband started working for the 1939 Club as a treasurer, when, under the guidance and ideas of Dr. Sam Goetz, the chair of Holocaust studies was established at <span class="BUILDING">UCLA</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">When you are on the <span class="BUILDING">UCLA campus</span> , close to <span class="BUILDING">Ralbunch building</span> , you will see on a column, a plaque with great names, and among them is the name of David and Estelle Klipp, and others, all, if I’m not mistaken, members of the 1939 Club, who contributed financially and otherwise, to the establishment of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Now, Dr. Sam Goetz 1s really to be commended very, very highly for his idea, which seemed strange for some people who could not understand the significance of establishing such a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Now -- this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> now, actually from the very beginning, had very good professors, some who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and then Professor Friedlander, who was just recently awarded the genius re -- genius award, and who wrote -- who’s writing many books, and he was teaching in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and after awhile -- that was a great accomplishment that he consented to be head of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">But there were previously, also, very, very famous professors, and the attendance in this classes was absolutely great. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">One time there were 300 students. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And I don’t know exact number now, and also now there are graduates from this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> , who teach the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And th -- I think, as an -- out of this example, there is now a chair of Holocaust studies at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , and many other <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">So my husband realized the importance of it, and he was a very busy man, working, head of a <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , a large <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and he consented to be the treasurer, because they needed somebody who can handle it, and my husband had the accounting background, and he -- and he was in this position for 17 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Each year they had to change the -- the laws, allowing him to become treasurer for another year. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And the -- the 1939 Club 1s -- I think was a very wonderful idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And there is a book about it, and it’s very -- our minutes are being sent to some archives, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  So, what -- when -- when, about, was the as -- when was that chair established, that was in the -- in the 70’s, or in the 80’s, about?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">ANSWER:  Because he was -- okay, he was there -- he was 17 years, then when he felt that he cannot do it any more, because of -- I mean, he -- he knew something about himself, which I didn’t even noticed. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">He said he has to -- and that he has to give it up, and the -- because then, the treasurer, who was another man maybe for two years, and three years, SO we were five, six years. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Six and 17 would be 21, or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Maybe more. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I have a book, I could look it up, and tell you exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">QUESTION:  Did you stay in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> for a long time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">ANSWER:  That’s a good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I wish we did, but Philip was -- I mean, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> was changing, that’s for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">But the most important thing was that the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , which Philip, my older son, was supposed to enter was much to be desired. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">An in -- there was -- it was not a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which I would be happy that he goes to, for many reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And I am not prejudiced, I really -- I mean, I’m normal, but the -- I respect everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Now, so we had to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">So we moved to a four <span class="INT_SPACE">units</span> , and we lived in one. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">We bought that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and then I -- I was managing it, Dave was, of course, very busy 1n his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I never mentioned about his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , but I will. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And I was doing everything there, and it -- I had many responsibilities, and life was really not easy, but -- but that there was -- it was important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  Let’s talk about that a little bit more, about the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and what the kind of work was that --

<p><span class="sentence" id="459">ANSWER:  He’s not yet in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Now there, I decided that I want to become a nutritionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I have always -- I have always been interested in nutrition. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">It started actually -- see my -- my father had diabetes, and had a kidney stone, and -- in the -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , he didn’t have neither diabetes, nor the kidney stone. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And that happened to other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">However, we had pathologic -- these were pathological diseases. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">The other diseases, of course, are typhus, edema of the legs or the whole body, due to malnutrition, epidemiological diseases were rampant, but these diseases were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">So, after the lib -- not right after the liberation, but approximately -- yeah, I was actually conscious of it even when we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bull Heights</span> , because I wanted Philip to eat vegetables, and if he didn’t eat the vegetables, I would awf -- awfully upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And he -- but he -- while we were living on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kenmore</span> , I decided that I want to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , and I went to Los Angeles City College to become a nutritionist, and I actually enjoyed it very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And Charlie remembers waiting for me on the <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> , and watching the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> turn around. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And the -- tho -- we had classes in anatomy, which were very helpful to me, and I -- there were many students from the nursing department, and I was really able sometimes even to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">However, 1n 1960, there was a change. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Dave had a massive, very serious heart attack, and I gave up <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">It was so serious, that the doctors were trying to convince me that he will never survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">But with my optimistic outlook, and knowing Dave, who can overcome a lot, I -- I told them that they don’t dare telling me that. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And this -- this was the same year as President Eisenhower had his heart attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And Dr. Griffiths, a famous cardiologist, was also in -- invited to see Dave. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">When he looked at his file, he was very grim. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">But when he walked in and saw Dave, he changed his mind, and he told the other doctors there is a 50 - 50 cha -- chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Now that was very important, because the attitude of the doctors is important. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Now, Dave recovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I -- maybe it 1s not what is being usually done today when children are concerned, however, I tried to keep up their violin lessons, and I was waiting to tell them, and to bring them to Dave, when Dave was able to wear a robe, and be in the <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">My feeling, in my case, the children were young, the father was a big support to them, and I was very much concerned that that will- it will affect them. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">So, all the friends knew that they don’t dare tell anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Anyhow --
QUESTION:  It worked so that Dave got better?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  Dave recovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">It was the -- what was happening actually, he needed a pacemaker, but the pacemaker wasn’t in -- was not yet invented. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So, there was a certain medication which just came out, which he was getting, but he was able to work with pulse of 40, and sometimes even 35. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I don’t know how this guy did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I used to feed him vitamin E, which our friend, Dr. Horoby gave me permission to do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Anyhow, when he recovered, he was still working in the same <span class="BUILDING">establishment</span> , but now he was the head of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">He had the mastery of the English language, and knowing -- and he ex -- it was explained to the administration what his background is, and believe me, he was working there for 17 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">He was admired, and he was respected by -- by the see -- the chairman of the board became his friends, and other directors became his friends, and the people who work for him loved him. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">So he was very demanding, much of himself, and much for others. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Now, later on -- first it was a <span class="BUILDING">Carr shoe store</span> , then there was HRT, and on top of this duties in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , he also became the director of imports. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And -- but he -- when this possibility of becoming treasurer for the 1939 Club came upon, he gladly accepted it, and he was working long hours, and really enjoyed doing it, because he believed in that good cause. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">So we are now -- now we have to move again, because Philip has to enter -- I mean, the <span class="BUILDING">junior high</span> was fine, it was vigil, and it was alright, and he was doing quite well there, but there was a very good <span class="BUILDING">school</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Fairfax High School</span> , and we wanted him to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fairfax</span> , and we needed to be in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">So now -- by the way, after Dave’s heart attack, I decided that I better have a profession, so I went to a <span class="BUILDING">real estate school</span> , passed the examination and got a real estate license. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And I was able to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we are now, a 16 unit, quite nice <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and the down payment was low, and I figured out that if I had to finance -- we finance the four units and -- and I’Il be able to buy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And I remember when Dave asked me, “How will you buy it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I said, “Dave, I will have the money.” </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And I came here, looked at it, and Dave only had five minutes time. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">He came from work, and left. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Just -- he introduced himself to the previous owner, and I made the decision very quickly, and we bought the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Now, we -- people were asking me, “Weren’t you afraid?” </span><span class="sentence" id="505">There was -- at times, there were many vacancies. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I said, “I’m not afraid of hard work, and I am afraid, however, of having financials problems,” but of hard work -- and I worked very, very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I -- there are still the -- many <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> there is linoleum, I put -- I was putting up squares. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">In many <span class="NPIP">places</span> they still -- they’re wallpaper, which I put on. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I learned to change washers. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I -- even today, I -- when <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage disposal</span> 1s blocked, I can unblock it very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And I still do many things, not as many things as I did before. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Now, Dave -- I was doing everything, and -- and when I had a vacancy, I didn’t even tell Dave. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">He was just too busy, and I didn’t want to bother him. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">However, he did the paperwork, which was very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Well, when Dave passed -- about half a year before he passed away, I started doing the accounting, the paperwork, and Dave was so impressed that I can do it, and believe me, it was a big relief to him, because he was always worried, how will I be able to do it, and I think that was much easier than to take care of his health. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Anyhow --
QUESTION:  Estelle, let’s put -- let’s go back just a little bit, because I do want to ask you, when did you s -- did you ever talk to your children about both your war experiences, and if you did, when did you start?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  This is a very good question, and it’s easier now to answer it, because I talked to Philip just recently, and I told him certain things from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and he says, “Do you know you never talked to me about it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And -- But Dave did. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I think maybe he talked to - | -- I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">But, it depends -- the reaction of children is different. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Now, Philip knew already everything from Dave, and he --
QUESTION:  By what age, sort of --
ANSWER:  Young.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">QUESTION:  Young.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">ANSWER:  He was -- he was fairly young. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">They used to take walks, they had a marvelous relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Both boys had very good relationship with Dave. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And the -- so, he knew everything, and -- and he was angry about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And he -- it influenced him, definitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">QUESTION:  Why -- why angry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">ANSWER:  That it happened, and also that God permitted it to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">See, I never blamed God. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Somehow I never blamed God. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Maybe my philosophy about God is different. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Maybe I really believe that we get a certain energy, or we get influence, or we get guidance, but in my philosophy about God was -- is such, probably, that I never blamed God for what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">But anyhow -- but was -- Charlie was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Charlie figured that if we could survive it, he can survive everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So, he depends on the personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Now, I might have talked to Charlie more. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I have to check it with him, but he -- not really -- I was so busy about that they eat right, and that they do their homework, and that of course, was the [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">It wasn’t the lack of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I would have found the time to talk to them, but probably I didn’t feel like talking, and since my husband did all the talking, then -- then I -- I was surprised when my -- when Philip just recently told me that I -- when I talked to him about it, that I never talked to him about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">So --
QUESTION:  Did you -- did you ever go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">ANSWER:  No, I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I -- I couldn’t, I couldn’t see what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I was going to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where all national holidays were celebrated, and the -- but we knew about an -- anti-Semitism, specially in the -- in the year before the outbreak of the war, it was also the influence of that folksdeutschen. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I mean the German who were living in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and cus --
QUESTION:  Ethnic Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">ANSWER:  Ethnic Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And the -- but that -- that -- that would not be the -- th-that wouldn’t have influenced me so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I speak Polish very well, and I finish <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and I loved hearing music of Chopin, and the -- we were good citizen, I’m sure we were good citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Now, what influenced me? </span><span class="sentence" id="550">When the Germans -- it’s unbelievable -- when the Nazis came into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and the Nazis were actually the -- the invaders, the Nazis could not really differentiate on a <span class="DLF">street</span> , who is Jewish, and who is not. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">But there were Polish children, and Polish youngsters, who are pointing out to their invaders who is a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Now, this is something which I really -- which is very bothersome to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And you know there was -- there was one occurrence that when survivors came back, they were killed by the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I would still be tolerant of them, because we all make mistakes, however, there is anti-Semitism now in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Now, of course, we left everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I have property in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and some is actually I think in -- in -- in my name now, but people who tried to -- to become owners of their property have big difficulties, big difficulty. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And -- okay, we left them everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">We left them the family jewel, we left them -- the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was taking away by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">One day, they came to my father, we had like a <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> , not as big --
QUESTION:  Estelle, I’m sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I think we should probably stop here. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">This is the end of tape two, side A, interview with Estelle Klipp. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Pl just switch it over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Estelle Klipp. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">This is tape number two, side B. So we were just talking about why you did not want to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and maybe you can say a little bit more about that, but also then say how you feel about Polish people in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Believe it or not, that I actually like when I have opportunity to speak Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And recently I needed to write a letter to someone, and it was amazing, I wrote it very well, and the trick is actually to think in Polish, not to think English, and really I was amazed how well I did, autographically, and otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Now, I don’t have any hate in my heart, amazing as it is, and I wish that Polish people well. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I wish that they develop a good economy, that they have a democratic government. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">However, I just wish very, very much, that they understand that being anti-Semitic actually doesn’t make sense, and that there is no reason to hate us. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And it is not helpful to them at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Now, I wish they followed the teaching of the present Pope, Pole, who went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , and who claims, rightly so, that actually the Jews contributed a lot to Christianity. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">That they gave Jesus, who was, of course, Jewish, to -- to the Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Now, let’s be optimistic again, and let’s hope that the time will come, that maybe if their economic situation improves, that they will start thinking in these terms, so the tradition of anti-Semitism is so long, and so much imbedded in their -- a-actually even the fathers in chur -- in the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> , that it will take some great influence to change their minds, but hopefully -- hopefully they will, and I really wish them well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  So, you don’t have hate in your heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  No, I don’t have hate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">QUESTION:  But it would have been too difficult for you psychologically, and emotionally, to go back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">ANSWER:  It would be like taking a wound, and opening it, and maybe even putting -- putting acid over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I mean, I just always see the pictures, especially the picture where we arrived- arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="581">We were lucky there was -- my whole family was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I -- I see other pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I just hope -- which I mentioned in my tape, that the deaths of my parents wasn’t pa -- was not painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I -- I just couldn’t go there, I just could not go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And ti -- unless, of course, let’s say my children would insist, I might have changed my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">But for myself, it will be devastating, and I really need my health. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I needed my health to take care of my husband, I needed the health to -- to be the manager here, I need my health for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And it won’t be really constructive, because if I would know that I am achieving something, then it might influence me. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">But I would not achieve absolutely anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">The property which we have there, I will try to do something about it, but the likelihood is not very great that I would be compensated in any way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">QUESTION:  Did you ever go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="593">ANSWER:  Oh, that’s a good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">We -- I am very much concerned about <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I -- we have the Jerusalem Post, and I -- when I get the Jerusalem Post, I read it from the first page to the last. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">So sometimes they were already in the paper, which I’m getting every day, the Los Angeles Times, there are also some information. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I am -- I’m very concerned about <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and the -- very, very concerned, and -- however, and sometimes really I wish, specially now, to be able to visit, but I have now -- now somebody who does it for me, and it is my granddaughter Rachel, and she’s -- right now she is hiking in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">desert</span> , saw Angetti, saw the <span class="DLF">Wailing Wall</span> , and when she saw the <span class="DLF">Wailing Wall</span> , the girl started crying, from emotions. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">So, when she will come back, she will give me some impression of her own. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Both my sons were in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and visited it, and --
QUESTION:  Was there a special reason why you didn’t go? </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Why you never went, the two of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">ANSWER:  That’s a very good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Dave was really very concerned about <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and -- however, Dave, when the pa -- first pacemaker came out, Dr. Griffiths made the decision that it’s time for Dave to have it, because his heart was very large, and the first surgery was actually open heart surgery, and thanks to my vigilance, I notice after a few months, quite a short time, that he’s not well. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And I -- I had a very hard time impressing it abou -- upon the people who had -- in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , which was Dr. Kaper from the surgery, and it was the <span class="BUILDING">Saint Vincent Hospital</span> , Dr. Kay was away, there was remodeling going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And finally, when I told them that if Dr. Kay comes back, how will they be able to face him if they don’t check on Dave? </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Finally they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">So I and Charlie went with Dave there, and the minute they saw him, they took him to the <span class="INT_SPACE">operating room</span> , and at this time, they inserted a -- the pacemakers which are -- which are being inserted now, which don’t -- don’t require open heart surgery, but 1t’s done through the arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Now, Dave had the misfortune that anything which can go wrong with the pacemaker, including a runaway pacemaker, where the pulse was over 200, happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Now, he had about 10 surgeries to change the pacemaker, so I have to compliment the medical profession because the last 12 years, the pacemaker lasts like eight years or more. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Anyhow, considered all of this, I felt that it’s not safe for us to go on a journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">First, we were always afraid the pacemaker will fail, and that’s why we did not go to see <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , so I really wish, for my husband, and also for myself, but where I am concerned, there is always possibilit -- a possibility that I still can do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="611">QUESTION:  Did you, either one of you, ever testify in front of turbunal -- tribunal?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="612">ANSWER:  Yes, Dave. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">It is in his tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">He was testi -- his testimony was there -- they took the testimony here, and yeah, he testified. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And he did -- testimony was taken here and sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">QUESTION:  But you nev -- you were never asked?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  No, I was never asked to testify. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">He -- you know, when he testified, they ask him whether he’s a lawyer, the way he testified, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="619">QUESTION:  Would you have done it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="620">ANSWER:  Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">QUESTION:  Had you -- had you ever been asked?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">ANSWER:  If I -- what -- see, he had a tremendous memory, Dave. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Of course, if I would s -- if I would know of some people whom I know what crimes have penetrated, and if I would have, I definitely would testify, this my duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Just as I feel about this interview, that it is my duty to bear witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">QUESTION:  I only ask -- I only ask that because I bil -- I seem to remember from your videotape that you said that you would have had butterflies doing it, and especially testifying about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and I just meant to ask you what that meant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">ANSWER:  Iam very so -- you know, that’s interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I am -- you know, I am following a lot of alternative medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">So I really am grateful, and I appreciate the regular medicine because -- and I want to maybe here have the opportunity to say thanks to Dr. Horlumby, who was our friend and doctor, and helped Dave enormously. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And to Dr. Griffiths, and to Dr. Shakman, who helped Dave really to live a long life. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">However, I also added, to this medical approach, a -- the alternative medicine approach, like homeopathy, and herbs, and also a certain treatment by a chiropractor, which was very helpful -- which was very helpful to David, and also to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Now, Regina told me that I mentioned in my tape that I would have butterflies in my stomach, probably, if I would have to testify. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Now, I became stronger through this treatment, and I just wanted to mention here that I realize -- and I also go to a regular doctor, and I realize their contribution to medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">It’s only a-at- a -- addition to my regular -- to my regular medical treatment. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">So, fortunately, I am pretty good health. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Now, this treatment which I am receiving, made me stronger emotionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And if this question would have been asked from me today, I would have said I would gladly face them, and I would gladly testify. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">It is my duty to do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">So, we grow. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">We never stop growing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">QUESTION:  Well, you also just learned Spanish, I heard, so you definitely don’t stop --
ANSWER:  Yes, yes, that’s true, you know, where we’re talking about the tradition, about learning. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">I ust recently learned Spanish, and I can communicate, and it’s a big help to me, and I -- I enjoy and probably I'll still learn another language, in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">QUESTION:  Estelle, let me ask you something -- well, I’m asking you something all the time, but it’s just when you mentioned that your granddaughter had a very special experience, emotional experience in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="728">QUESTION:  [inaudible]
ANSWER:  So, the reason I answer it this way, was that I was so busy doing something which had- see, he’s the father of my children, he is my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">He is himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And if I can prolong his wi -- life, and I can keep him healthy, I thought this would be my greatest achievement, and it was really, really the -- the aim of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I have a friend, she used to always say, “Okay, David, but where is Estelle?” </span><span class="sentence" id="732">I just -- just -- even un -- didn’t understand what she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Now, on top of it, I -- I am -- I was taking care of the 16 units. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">When I had a vacancy, I didn’t even tell him. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Now, since he passed away, I am the owner, I am the manager, I clean up a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">I do all the paperwork, I prepare the taxes. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">So, I am actually very busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And I was even -- I was just as busy before, to a certain degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And i -- so to tell you the truth, right now, I -- the memories haunt me more than before. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Before, I was even busier, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I have some memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Sometimes I dream that why I’m not going to our <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , I would be very good at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And I -- I -- one time I had a very destructive dream, but I don’t have them too frequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">This picture of -- of the day in August, where we came out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and had to leave everything, and suddenly we were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">So I didn’t know for a long time what actually happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">This -- this scene just lives with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">I live with this scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">I -- this -- na -- it -- it really never parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Also, what haunts me was when they took my father, and specially my mother to the krippo, because I -- it’s in my tapes, when she tame -- came back, she was just emotionally destroyed, and I was happy when they took me also, so -- not that I was big help, but -- so this -- this was very traumatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">My --

<p><span class="sentence" id="758">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="759">QUESTION:  Now, I just want to say, you just talked about two memories, or two images that -- that haunt you, and I was just wondering whether you had -- whether you want to conclude this with another one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="760">ANSWER:  Very often I think -- we had a -- it’s mentioned the tape, we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> in our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and [indecipherable] in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and we were hiding there whenever there was deportation, pretty successfully, and very often I think, maybe if we wouldn’t have gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , maybe if we would have been hiding there, but then I think, where would we get food? </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And of course, we didn’t know, because there were actually <span class="DLF">graves</span> prepared for the people who were designated to clean the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="762">So, we didn’t know that the Russian were -- at -- Russians will enter so soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="763"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litzmanshtadt</span> , so even the Rukoski went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">They were so deceiving, the Nazis, that they were able to convince us that we are going to a better <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Anyhow, that haunts me so very often, because I figured maybe -- then maybe we would been able to -- to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Then, I often see the picture of my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">He became rather -- rather religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> he used to lay the tefillin, which they something you put on your head, and you wrap your arm, and he was extremely handsome. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And, so it’s a great pain that he didn’t survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Then, of course, I often think of my mother, she was an exceptional woman, never complained either. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And -- and w-which other memories? </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Course I remember, yeah, there was -- but that is in my tape, this -- when we were walking with this wooden shoes, and the -- it was the -- ice was growing under our shoes, and they did not permit us to stop and clear it, and I also -- also it was very often on my mind, there was one Mrs. Cohen. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">She was a mother of a girl maybe a little bit younger than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">She was very often whipped and punished, and -- but, going back to the alternative medicine, in connection even with that, and to the yoga, which I practice religiously every day, and I feel that I can stretch better, really, as time progresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I became stronger, emotionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">So, when these memories come, I still could realize that I cannot allow them to take over, because there is still so much I have to do right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And the -- for instance, I learned yoga actually, when I was quite young, from Indra Davy, and she was from <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And then for about 20 years, I couldn’t do it, because I had a pain in my back, lower back, which didn’t nutch -- nothing -- nothing wrong showed up on MRI, but I had this pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Now, when my chiropractor learned to do -- she used to helped me, but it was coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Then she learned a certain method, which is developed by doctor -- Dr. Donald Epstein from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , which was called networking, which 1s actually they just touch certain points, and miraculously, it sounds strange, but Il tell you anyhow about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">One time, short -- maybe two weeks after she was practicing it with me -- on me, my arm started -- started moving in yoga positions. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And the -- since then -- of course, I tried to -- it’s getting better, and better, but I do not have the problem with my back now, and I started doing yoga. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And actually my yoga is improving as I -- I don’t know whether I mentioned it before. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And I can do -- I can stretch better as the time progresses, and it gives me awfully good feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Besides that, there are seven postures, specially the ones which stretch the neck, which have a big, relaxing influence over the emotions. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And I guess also the nutrition which I practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Now, there is s -- something called he -- hemio -- hemiopathy -- homeopathy. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And it was actually discovered in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , about more than 200 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And these remedies are also very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Now, in order to know which vitamin is good for us, which is not, or [indecipherable] food, there is a method used by chiropractors, and also other practitioners of alternative medicine, called muscle testing. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">The people who do it are kinesthiologists. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">That’s how they call themself. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">Now, one chiropractor taught me how to do it, and I w -- I’m trying to teach others, but I don’t know why, I am not successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">I only was able to teach my grandson. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">He just was so impressed, because the idea of this muscle testing is such. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">If we put into our bodies, whether it’s a [indecipherable] vitamin or food, which is good for us, it strengthens our muscles. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And the opposite if it’s not good for us, it weakens our muscles. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">So, the method is, after the certain, let’s say food or vitamin, is put on the body, usually close to the simus, which is on the chest, and one checks the arm by having the arm extended, and trying to push it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">If the remedy is not good for the body, the arm will go down. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">If it’s good for the body, it won’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And the same can be used with the fingers, which I -- which I use, and I’m pretty accurate at 1t. Now this was helping me very much with my husband, because I was able to determine whether things are good for him or not, and it’s a great help to me, because I am able to resist what is not good for me, since I know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Now, I know of a doctor who used to be a doctor of alter -- of emergency medicine, and he -- he is now doing alternative medicine, and he uses -- he has a machine which he uses, but where I went to him one time, and I show him that I can do muscle testing, he says, “You don’t need to come to me any more.” </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And I don’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="804">QUESTION:  So you are still trying to, or you are still growing, all the time? </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Not just stretching, but
ANSWER:  Yes, and so -- that was extremely helpful because it was very important to help my husband in all ways -- I mean, in all possibly ways, so that he could live long. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And the -- [ -- it just -- I spoke to my cousin, he’s in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , I mean, actually his son, he says, do you know -- and that was maybe in °85 or so, “Do you remember -- now he’s doing so well, and do you remember how it was in -- in 1970 when I talked to you, how worried you were about him?” </span><span class="sentence" id="807">So I’m very -- so he’s not here, but he had a good life, and we keeped him healthy, and the -- I don’t want to give myself more credit than I deserve, but I hear from all kinds of <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> , friends, doctors and others, that I was quite helpful in keeping him healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">Now, what would you like me to a -- what would you like to ask me?</span></p>

ANSWER:  There is always -- there is always room to improvement. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">Even to just take care of the family, there are many problems, which you have to overcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">Now, if you have a business, there are many problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">There are different people you have to deal with, whom you have to instruct, or who do better, or do worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Now imagine a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> of the size of the United States of America. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Of course there are problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Of course, but y -- there being wor-worked at. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">I am concerned about education. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">I was -- I wasn’t happy when arts have been taken away from <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , and now it’s a tendency to put them back into <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , which I am very happy about. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">I am concerned about the environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And the -- it’s a fine <span class="DLF">line</span> between business and environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">I am very happy to see what the difference in the -- in the attitude towards tobacco, when in the beginning all the actresses were smoking, and -- to be able, I’ll tell you, it’s such a great achievement, to be able to come to the point now where there is no advertising on television, and all the advertising used to be for tobacco, for cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I think that is enormous achievement. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">There are many enormous achievements. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And even in the race relations. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">So it’s not perfect, but the achievements are absolutely great. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">So I have great hopes that the -- the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> will flourish in all respects, and I think the education will also improve, because they are now. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And if I can help in any way, I’Il be very great to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="872">QUESTION:  That’s a positive outlook again. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Is there -- do you speak often -- do you give interviews or public talks about -- about where you come from often, or is it an -- a rare thing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="874">ANSWER:  On the Bar Mitzvah of my granddaughter, I had to get up and thank people for something, and they told me that I am pretty good public speaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I mean, I didn’t have to say too mu -- and I probably, if I have to get up and talk, I would be able to. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">However, I didn’t do much of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I have a friend, Celine Drack, who goes to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , who speaks, and receives many letters, she is very goo -- letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">She is very good at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">She also went to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and talked to the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And she’s also involved in Anti-Defamation League, and in the club, and so on, and I admire her for it, and it’s a very worthwhile endeavor. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">I was never -- there are many -- she also is the head of a teacher’s group. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">She teaches teachers how to teach Holocaust in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="883">I have a better opinion about myself now than I used to, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And -- and if there would be really a need for me to speak -- I would do some studying, of course, because it’s nice to -- you know, it’s nice to be able to answer many questions which the students have. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">But it’s a very worthwhile endeavor, because if you meet a survivor, and you hear him talk, it has a good influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="886">QUESTION:  You know, I was just about to ask you, h-h-how do you think the impact of survivor testimony has been on -- on -- in understanding of the Holocaust, in general? </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Tell me, do you have any --
ANSWER:  We are very fortunate, very fortunate, that after the hiatus of time, when people didn’t dare -- people didn’t want to know, and there were so many deniers of the Holocaust, that after this time, thanks to the TV, and thanks to the movies, we became -- it became public. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Not everybody s-still knows about it, but many people do, and it’s a big relief for the survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">Anyhow, I feel this way, because you know, in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , was a saying that the worst curse actually in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was mishamime visacrone. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And I didn’t know what it means. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">It means erase from memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">So being erased from memory, even you know, there were no many -- many curses in my <span class="BUILDING">ho-home</span> , where -- with my parents, but even about Hitler, they say -- they say he should be erased from memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">So this points how important it is, that the people who perished should be remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">I mean, it’s mindboggling, it’s -- because if you say six million, you cannot imagine it, but if you talk about a few, like Anne Frank, or others, then you could realize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Now, I very grateful for- for it being now recognized, and taught, that’s why I really commend Dr. S-Sam Goetz for establishing this chair of Holocaust studies, and I hope -- and I have a feeling that the deniers of the ho -- of the Holocaust, are quieting down, cause we don’t hear so much about them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="896">QUESTION:  I’m just curious [indecipherable] are you following sort, of some of the controversies around Holocaust studies? </span><span class="sentence" id="897">I mean some people would say that the discussion there has become very, very academic, and is taking away from the -- from the human experience in that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">Or that too much emphasis is being put on -- on -- on -- on the Holocaust, as over against other aspects of Jewish culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">How do you --
ANSWER:  They say if you forget history, it repeats itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">So, a base of this, it’s very important not to forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">I don’t think it’s too much, I do not think it’s too much, because it’s -- it’s like Wiesel, the -- who got a Nobel prize, says, you have to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">I mean, because otherwise it will repeat itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">It’s not only for the Jewish people, it’s for -- for the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">In order that something like that can happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">So, it didn’t happen overnight, the signs were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">But we have to learn to watch for the signs, and to do ab -- something about it before it becomes a Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">So, it’s not egoistic in any way, to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And there will be different aspect of the Holocaust, but all aspects should be as -- should be talked about it, because we are dying out. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">There will be no -- I mean, I can see among our friends, I looked at the telephone book, and it’s amazing how many people already passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Now, once we passed away, if we don’t leave the legacy, because as much as you talk, you don’t cover everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">It’s impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">So, for the benefit of mankind, not only of the Jewish people, it’s important to study it, and to know what it happen, because I don’t think there were prog -- pogroms, other people were persecuted, but the dimension of this persecution, and the planning of the Final Solution, is actually, in a way unique. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">I wish it isn’t -- 1t wasn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">QUESTION:  Do you think the world is learning from what can be learned from the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="915">ANSWER:  You know, when I think about <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> , this is the first time -- I mean, nothing 1s perfect, but considering what Milosevitch was doing to these people, he was burying them, he was murdering them. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And I -- and it’s fortunate that NATO, with the baking of - backing of the United State, had the guts to do something about it, and I am not qualified to say it, but there is likely a likelihood, that the Holocaust of the -- of the people during World War Two, had some influence of -- of this engagement. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">So we won’t eradicate hatred, but we might work towards eradication of hatred.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="918">QUESTION:  You did say just a -- just about two minutes ago, that Holocaust survivors are passing away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="919">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="920">QUESTION:  That’s true, but on the phone when we talked before I came here, you also said that you -- you referred to a spirit of the survivors, when you go to gatherings --
ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="921">QUESTION:  Maybe you could --
ANSWER:  Meanin -- well, the question is why certain people survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">May -- maybe some of the answer is to see them gathered together. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">We have this 1939 Club, who does a lot of charitable work, but we also gather together, and we combine some worthwhile endeavors with a dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And I actually -- it boggles my mind to see the e-enthusiasm, and the way these people dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Everybody dances. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">People who don’t feel good, dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Everybody dances, and I never saw anything like it, even between much younger people. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">So there is something special about the spirit of the survivors.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="929">QUESTION:  When y-you also said a little earlier that you don’t speak publicly, you’re not the kind to talk publicly very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">But, you -- you thought it was very important to do this interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="931">ANSWER:  Yes, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">I said once that I’m -- I didn’t feel guilty that I survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">But I would feel very guilty if I would not make the video when I had a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">I would feel very guilty if | would not make this interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">So I thought maybe other people have more to say, but even if other people have more to say, what I have to say could be -- it’s also history. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">So, I have the obligation, and I’m going to -- I have some pictures of my family which were saved by somebody who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and I’m going to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust office</span> , which is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="937">I had it all prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And I’m going to get a little bit more involved, too, so that the memory of -- of the people like -- the photos which I have, what I know about it, and maybe I could mention here I appreciate the opportunity about my husband’s brother, because that was something which he was so hurt and sad about. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">He was -- he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , his brother Solomon, and -- in the hope to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , what was happening, it was under the Russian occupation, and then under -- under German occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">Finally, when the Nazis won, they just murdered him. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">I mean, not only him, there was a Mr. Frumkin, who was, I understand, also murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And this Solomon had such potentials. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">He spoke a beautiful English, and there was a English club, and when the speaker didn’t come, he spoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">And there was such a pain for David, my husband, his whole life, that his brother didn’t survive.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="955">QUESTION:  You never wait for [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  You are a very lovely interpre -- interviewer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="956">QUESTION:  Okay, well, thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">I-I’m blushing. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">But let me get -- let me get to the question. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">So the question would be then, when you look back at your life, of -- of 55 years, of the last 55 years, your life here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , what -- how would you t -- how would you speak about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="960">How would you -- how would you describe it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="961">ANSWER:  It’s a very interesting question, and a few days ago I said, you know, since liberation, there’s actually -- 1t was 1945, so are -- 55 years, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="962">So there are 55 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">I have to talk about 55 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And -- but it doesn’t seem so lo -- it wasn’t easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">It was not easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Now, the reason -- one of the reason it wasn’t easy was that my husband so -- he was always active, and had a lot of energy. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">His mind was fantastic, even nearly to the very last minute, so he was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="968">And I am very proud and happy about it, that I kept him at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> til the last minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And I was present at his death, and I could tell that there was a- his body was like a shell, but he still was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And then, since we lived so long in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , I just feel his presence, and I told him about this interview, and I -- believe it or not, I still pray for him, that wherever he 1s, he’s -- he’s at peace, and that everything 1s alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">So there was always a feeling, even when I was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , there was always a feeling of responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And so the life was not easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">However, it helped me -- oh, especially in -- in the later years, it helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Yoga, nutrition, homeopathy, herbs, all these helped me to feel healthy, be healthy, and being able to function in spite of the memories, and in spite of whatever difficulties I have to face. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">However, it wa -- a big aspect -- I was very fortunate with the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">They were good students, they didn’t give me any trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">I don’t -- when I didn’t have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , we used to go with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , everywhere, and I didn’t have any problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">I understand they were fighting very frequently in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but that’s -- that’s normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">Now, for instance, Philip is very bright. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I mentioned, I guess before, that he went to <span class="BUILDING">UCLA</span> while still at <span class="BUILDING">Fairfax High</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="981">And he is the avid reader, he always learns. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">He speaks perfect Hebrew, and perfect Spanish, and he also speaks man -- not speaks, but he knows many computer languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">And he’s also very good at composing software. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">That’s something which is very much sought after, and the -- and he happens to be extremely good at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Now, I was also fortunate 1n -- he just, this year, he was celebrating his 30" weddings anniversary. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">He has a very lovely wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">She has teacher’s credentials. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">She’s extremely talented. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">There is a picture here, I will show it to Regina, which she painted. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">It was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> at -- at <span class="BUILDING">UCLA</span> , <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> of my son, with all his books, and she printed the Hebrew text, which is -- you can see when you look at the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">She also can work with wood, she can do gardening. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">I don’t know whether there is anything this girl cannot do. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And then, in nine -- then, I told you about the birth of Charlie in 1951, and ha -- he has very much my husband’s personality, and when I -- it was -- I’m really grateful, these two boys 1s like a great gift to me, and their wives also. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And Charlie was celebrating his 20" weddings anniversary, and the -- during the Olympics, he was associated with ABC, and he was the directors of systems, and he, with others, devised a systems for the payroll, and other things, and his name was on the credits, on television, after the Olym -- when the credits were shown. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">He -- he also has this personality that people like to work for him, and the people who are working for him- and it was very strenuous work, told him that whenever he wants to, they will always work for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">His wife has also teacher’s credentials, and also, as I mentioned before, she also is interested in alternative medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">I mentioned that, and she is a wonderful mother, and so I have actually two sons, and two very wonderful girls.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="998">QUESTION:  I -- I forgot whether I asked you that before, but in the case I haven’t, I just want to know, what about Jewish tradition, and Jewish faith, is that perpetuated in them, in both families?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="999">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">Charlie, Friday night, there is time to be at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and there are no other arrangements being made, and there is -- there’s Shabbat dinner with the challah, and with candles being lit, and with the prayers, and all the children know the prayers, and they go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , they [indecipherable] they live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sebastapal</span> , in <span class="REGION">northern California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">They used to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> , but they found there a very good <span class="NPIP">place</span> for the children to go to <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> , and they are practicing -- they are definitely practicing Judaism, and the -- Rachel was very anxious to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , she went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in a group called Young Judea, which is under the auspices of the Hadassah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">And so --
