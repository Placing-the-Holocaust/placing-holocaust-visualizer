<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  And can you give the names of your parents and siblings? </span><span class="sentence" id="8">November 1, 2009
ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My father’s name is Hirsch Hollenberg, and I think he was born in — in 1898, because I remember him telling us the stories that he was in the first World War when he was 16 or 17, so that puks — puts him approximately that age. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My mom was Sally Rosenberg, and I was told that she was 10 - 11 or 12 years older — younger than my father, and I’m not totally sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">So that would put her about — her birth date about 1910 or 1912. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I know she was 18 when she got married in 1930, and a year later, or two years later, I was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  And you have — did you have any siblings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  I have two younger brothers, I was the oldest of three. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Actually four. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">But I had a brother that was 15 months younger than I was, and his name was Haskell. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And I had my second younger brother was about four years younger than I was, and his name was Bunion, b — b-u-n-i-o-n, [ think. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And — and when we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , my mom had a tiny baby, and about January of 1943, or February, and he died during one of the pogroms.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Let’s step back before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Can you tell me what your life was like before World War II broke out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Well, I remember my parents as extremely loving. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">My father had a big <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">We had lots of <span class="REGION">land</span> , and we actually were quite well off. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">My mom family lived down the <span class="DLF">street</span> from us, the Rosenstocks(ph) and my grandma had a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant bar</span> kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And her <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was just across from the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So — the November 1, 2009 <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> where they sold horses and cattle, so I remember going there on Thursday and early, very early Thursday morning, my grandma would come — she — to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And I remember her brown buns hair in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And she would say, okay children, it’s time to get dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And she was just the most loving person. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My mom, she was one of six children, I think, maybe five. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">She had a older sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">She had three younger brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I think she was one of six, maybe five. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And — and again I remember one of my mother’s brother, when it was my first day of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> he came by my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I had a white bow on my head, he made — wanted to make sure that I look my best, and — and I was sent off to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">But it was always, you know those memories a-are so vivid, and so important to me, that sort of — but it was sort of secret-like. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">It kept me alive for so long.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  And what was the Jewish life like? </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Was — how was the Jewish community integrated into the general life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , a —
ANSWER:  Well, we — w-we — 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koroléwka</span> , there were <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> a-along <span class="DLF">streets</span> , the <span class="DLF">streets</span> were unpaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was all Jewish, and there were <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">My fa — my family was not very religious, and neither was my mother’s family very religious, although my mom’s father, my grandfather which I never knew, everybody talked of him being as a religious person. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">M-My — my — the Hollenbergs, my — my father’s two sisters were not too religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So we’d go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and I’d go with my father and brother, and my father would take us to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> to keep us November 1, 2009 out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so my mom would have free time. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">But — and — and he loved the studying of Judaism, as a studying, as — as a point of discussion. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And I remember very high falutin’ discussion, and very serious because I remember the voices going up and down. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">But in the sense of devout, on the sense of — we were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">But again, 1-1n the morning, he would say his prayers with the tallis and the — oh, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And so in one sense we were Jewi — because we were Jewish my father said that it was important for all of us to know ar — and understand who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And I remember my younger brother would go to chayder, I didn’t go to chayder, I had a private tutor at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And my father would talk about the stories in the Bible with my brother and I would pipe in and tell the stories before my brother, and — and my father would say, now who am I talking to here? </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So, it w — it was just a very loving family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  And for holidays, did you celebrate with the extended family, and your cousins, and
ANSWER:  Ah, ye — sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">But my mom would start cleaning the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and — and preparing bread on Friday night, and bake it in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was cleaned for Shabbat, thoroughly every week, and on Pesach it was over-cleaned and painted anew an — on the high holidays again. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">So twice a year the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was re-cleaned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  And in terms of social life, did your family socialize mostly with relatives, with other Jewish families, or with Polish neighbors also? </span><span class="sentence" id="57">November 1, 2009
ANSWER:  No, we didn't social — well, we socialized because my mom had brothers and sisters, So we socialized with them, they would come and I remember playing [indecipherable], all that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And my father would spend an awful lot of time at his sister’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and my mom would say, you’re never here. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But, because we had a lot of <span class="REGION">land</span> and a big <span class="DLF">farm</span> , we dealt with the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> more than the Polish people on a daily basis, but 1t was more in terms of labor and work being done than coming to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and having coffee, nobody did that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  Did you help out on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> also, or it was just —
ANSWER:  Well, I helped out if I didn’t bother anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Let’s jump ahead to start of World War II in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I know that this is an <span class="REGION">area</span> that the Soviets occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Can you describe how life changed for you when you realized that the war was entering your own little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  Well, when the Soviets came, the first year went according usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But my father had to report m-more precisely how many — how much grain wi — came in, or how much potatoes, that was important. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And by the summer or spring of next year, my father, I remember him worrying that if we had too much <span class="REGION">land</span> , would they think us being rich, and would we have to be shipped away? </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So I remember already him worrying what will happen if the Soviets would stay — would have stayed, because the imposition and the taxes or the contribution of grain to the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> was quite different than before, and he couldn’t hire the — as many people as he did before. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">November 1, 2009
QUESTION:  And as a young child, did your life change at all under the Soviets?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  No, no, as a matter of fact, 1t was quite nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">You know, I — I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> freer; I was not as fearful. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I don’t know what to be fearful, I couldn’t tell you specifically, but it felt that the police was more on the <span class="REGION">Jewish side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">As a matter of fact, one of my mother’s brutha — brothers, which h-he is in the photograph, he served on the police force as a consultant for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So, that never happened before. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">No Jew would ever s- serve in government or a thing like that before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And one of my cousins — well, that was maybe before the war, he tested so high in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that they were going to send him to a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borschev</span> and that never happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Korolowka</span> before, that a Jewish boy would go to a <span class="BUILDING">Polish high school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  Do you have any memory of whether your family was aware of what was happening on the German side of the <span class="DLF">border</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  I didn’t know how — there was no newspaper in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , or — or radio, although the radio was just coming in, but it would be through a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">loudspeaker</span> , so you never knew what the news were. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">But what happened, the Jewish community would get papers, a month or two months old, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , or sometimes even from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and that’s how they sort of got their news. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">The best news, if anybody got the London paper, or the other English, or other foreign papers, which could have been six months old, I don’t know, but it was old papers, you know, that we got the news. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">But somehow, when — when in May or June, when the schism November 1, 2009 between <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> came about, everybody knew immediately what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And I don’t know how.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  Can you describe those first days when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> fell under German occupation in June 41, were there — did it take awhile before the front actually reached your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , or were you immediately aware?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  Well, we were immediately aware because the soldiers walked through, the German soldiers walked through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And I was watching them walk through, you see, so just marching, and everybody was happy and laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">But everybody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> knew that something terrible was going to happen, because a few months before, there were a lot of people from <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> running to the <span class="DLF">Russian borders</span> , and wa — and that was even before the war, before 1941, and there were some people that stayed with us in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , because any — you have to offer hospitality to any strangers that c-come through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And there were quite a few different couples that — or families that stayed in different <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and I remember them staying in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  And these are Jewish families —
ANSWER:  Jewish families —
QUESTION:  — from <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Yes, who were running away from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So we knew that something terrible was going to ha — is — 1s about to happen, but we didn’t know the extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  And did your life change immediately that day of — November 1, 2009

<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  — when the German soldiers —
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  What were the first changes that you experienced?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Well, the first changes, it was in June, and we were told, my father was told that he cannot hire people to work on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So, my mother went to work on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , on the — on the <span class="REGION">land</span> with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">A-And — in haying and all that stuff, he couldn’t hire laborers any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So I re — the reason I remember, because I was the oldest, I was left in charge of my two younger brother, and I remember washing the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and being so proud that, you know, at seven, eight years, I wa — I — a-an — and — and I remember my mother being prou — but the point is that my mother couldn’t do the daily chores and I was left to do the daily chores, so it was immediate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  And, were there any anti-Jewish restrictions other than the hiring, that were imposed that first summer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  Well, I-I — as a kid I don’t know what they were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  Were you allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> come September?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  No, oh no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">No, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was cut off even before then, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And that was in ’41.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  Now, do you remember the attitude of your neighbors changing? </span><span class="sentence" id="104">You talked before about how they were all laughing when the Germans marched through. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Did they start to react differently to your family after the Germans came? </span><span class="sentence" id="106">November 1, 2009
ANSWER:  No, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">If they did, I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Di — my family didn’t talk to them about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And I don’t remember any Ukraine family, even the people that worked for my father [indecipherable] at least I don’t remember my father talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Now that you mention it, I don’t know, maybe some of those memories will come back, but I don’t remember it as of right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I don’t remember any Ukraine family or Polish family being happy on what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Even as much as they hated the Russians, I don’t remember anyone coming over and saying that they’re happy the Germans are there. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">The only people that I remember being happy is the police force. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">They hired immediately — there was a new police force, and they were happy, a-and they looked — went with their batons quite co — a-around, and everybody was in their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> when the police went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But I don’t remember any — any Ukraines being happy that the Jews were —
QUESTION:  So other than the fact that your father couldn’t hire Ukrainian laborers, for the first war of the occupation, I’m talking before the fall of 1942, during that first year of — end of 1941, beginning of ’42, were there any other changes in your life, or is it basically carrying on as before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Well, it was basically sort of the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We heard the stories getting much worse, and — and all of a sudden there was a Jewish — a Jewish committee set up. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And when the Germans, or whoever it was needed things, they went to the committee and the committee obliged them. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So I remember putting — asking people to give money at first. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">November 1, 2009 That was right after the high holidays of that year. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I don’t know when it was, whether it was before the first pogrom in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koroléwka</span> , or when, but my father’s older sister had three boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And I told you one of the boys was this genius type who was going to go to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> for the first year. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And I think 1t was sometimes before the first pogrom that they asked for young boys as laborers, and they would go to the committee and the committee would provide. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And I think two of my cousins were taken as laborers and I think that they were sent either to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> or to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> , or — I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  Did you have to wear any identifying badge, or —
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I don’t remember when it was put on, whether when — after the first pogrom, I think, when we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we had to — or maybe — maybe before. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I’m not totally sure when we — we — we didn’t wear yellow stars, we wore white stars, white armbands, and the white armband supposed to be pressed and very designating. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And if it wasn’t, you were taken off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , and so people had plastic, white plastic things with elastic, and then the Jewish star, so the — the — the band was very neat and clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And I always wanted to know where they got those plastic bands, and I didn't dare ask anybody, and I still think about it, yeah, 70 years later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  So the first pogrom, that was fall of 1942?</span></p>

QUESTION:  So describe the — your memory of what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">It was the Jewish holiday, you were getting ready for the holiday, and I mean, wha-what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Well, let me tell you before. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Before, my father’s family s — I told you we knew what was happening and my cousins were sent off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And so — so that was before my cousins, I think, were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I’m not sure exactly, but my mo — my father’s two sisters, their families, they had three boys, one had two, one was a <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span> manager, he had his own little hardware and another family on his side dug a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> in my aunt’s — my aunt’s <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And there was a little <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> , and under the <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> we dug — they dug the — the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> that could hold 20 people, or thereabouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So, that summer, before the first pogrom, or that actually was even before the summer, because the earth was soft, so we already knew what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I didn’t know, but them digging a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> for no particular reason how to camouflage, so my father and family knew what was going to happen.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="323">ANSWER:  No, it wa — first of all, it was fear, not just for the baby’s survival, but for the adults’ survival, what would happen with a pogrom, with the killings, that we have to go into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">So we already knew that he might not sur — I mean, we knew that we were all in major danger, so I think, now that you mention it, that was probably one of the reason that we moved from building number one to <span class="BUILDING">building number two</span> , because October 8, 2010 there was a little bit more liberty, or people didn’t say we won’t allow the baby in the — in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Because every <span class="BUILDING">building</span> had a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , and in <span class="BUILDING">building number one</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> was between the two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , so it was a <span class="DLF">wall</span> was walled off, and we’d crawl into a s — into a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> to get into th — this <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And in <span class="BUILDING">building number two</span> , the one that we moved, the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">So when the killing began, everybody went into the — to the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , that was during the Purim massacre, and — and they didn’t allow the baby to come in with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">He was, by then, four or five weeks old, he was still tiny. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And you know — and I know he was tiny in — in the recollection of what he did, he was just lying there, he cou — you know, he couldn’t even smile yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">So he was very tiny. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And so we all went into — into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , and we couldn’t bring the baby, so we left the baby on a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , surrounded with pillows. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And my mom was crying and they kept holding her down. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And we stayed there, I don’t remember how long, but we stayed there til it was almost dark, you know, from the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And when we got upstairs we found the baby dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">But not just this, the baby’s cries were so loud, that the baby jeopardized the people next door, who were hiding in that <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> in between the <span class="DLF">walls</span> , between one <span class="DLF">wall</span> and another. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">So here were the people, here were the two — you know, and the cry from this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> — from this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to the — the police, it — this was not — this massacre wasn’t a German massacre, it was the Ukraine police and the German and the Poles that did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">So it October 8, 2010 wasn’t primarily the German Gestapo like when they cleaned out <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Korolowka</span> , like in the first pogrom. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">So this was a kind of cobr — co-cooperation with everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">QUESTION:  And the people who conducted this, were they, the Ukrainians and the Poles, were they known to the Jewish community from before, or were they brought in from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">ANSWER:  We didn’t know anybody, and I don’t recollect anybody knowing of retur — you know, being friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I knew one of my cousins worked for the Ukraine police, and one time I went to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> and the police caught me, and my cousin came and sort of rescued me in the poli — the Ukraine police let me go because of my cousin.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">QUESTION:  This was during the war, or before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">ANSWER:  That — everything was — that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borschev</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , a — a few weeks after — after the — the massacre. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">But — so, to finish the story with that — with that massacre o- on y — on Purim, after it was over, we went upstairs and we saw the baby dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And the next day, or maybe it was even the same day, there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> with a horse, and would drive by each <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and people would put their dead on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And my mother was so upset and crying that I took the baby, she gave me the baby, or I took the baby — anyways, I took the baby out and put the baby wrapped up in a blanket, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So I don’t even know where the baby was buried.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">QUESTION:  And were these Jews who were doing the burial, or — October 8, 2010
ANSWER:  Yeah, oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Nobody in those situation would — none of the Ukraines or the Poles were just too good, nobody would do any cleaning, everything had to be done by Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And then during Passover a month later, there was the big massacre, where they rounded up hundreds of people and they shot them in the Borschev massacre. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And they lined them up and they shot all the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I— I might be confusing a little bit because of such a long time, whether it was just at the Purim massacre, or the — or the — or — or the one just before Passover, where they lined up hundreds, everybody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borschev</span> and they shot them in the big <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And again, this wasn’t just a German — a German there with the — the — the — the Ukraine police with their shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And that <span class="DLF">grave</span> , it’s still there, but what I recollect, maybe that’s a childhood memory, was that the <span class="DLF">grave</span> itself was very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">It was about — longer than this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which is this — I don’t know how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Well, anyways, it was almost a half a block long. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And when I went to <span class="BUILDING">market</span> pe — the — the peasants were talking about the <span class="DLF">grave</span> , how it was bubbling and the — and the blood was just going up and down, bluh, bluh, bluh. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">So I went to the <span class="DLF">grave</span> , and wanted to see it, to the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> and wanted to see the <span class="DLF">grave</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And sure enough, it wasn’t as strong as the first day, but still, you can see the heave of the <span class="DLF">grave</span> , kind of, just the moving of the <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And — and I let it be, and there — one of the Sturmers(ph) — the people, the wife of Mr. Sturmer(ph), her name was Chana(ph), she said to me, she says, I just want you to remember that I saw you in a blue coat, walking around, and I saw where you were coming from, which means October 8, 2010 the direction of the cemetery. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So, do you know, I always thought that that was just a memory kind of thing that I remembered kind of, and wouldn’t say it til anybody til 50 60 years later, Chana(ph) Sturmer(ph) affirmed my memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">So, I don’t mean I was happy, but it was like the memories were really memories, because I didn’t talk much about the Holocaust or anything like that, 1t was just like 1t was unshared. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">It was something that I knew, and it was mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And to have somebody say, I saw from where — you know, in this blue coat, and all of a sudden, I remember the blue coat, and it was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">But after that big massacre, there were not that many Jews left in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borschev ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">QUESTION:  Let me just stop and ask you two questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So, with the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> — the big massacre, rather, on Passover, where —
ANSWER:  Or thereabouts, I’m not —
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">ANSWER:  — totally sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">QUESTION:  Id like t — explain, where were you and your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="370">How did you and your family survive that massacre? </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And also, could you say, when you went to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> afterwards, and you heard the peasants talking, can you describe the mood of the peasants? </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Were they just talking about this with happiness, wer — with curiosity, with sadness? </span><span class="sentence" id="373">October 8, 2010
ANSWER:  No, they were — they were just talking like it was an [indecipherable] for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">It was an unbelievable situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">None of them were happy, you know, was a happy -— it was a <span class="BUILDING">market</span> where people come on Thursday to do their business, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">So, it wasn’t — I don’t know if it was Thursday; in <span class="BUILDING">Korolowka market</span> day was a Thursday, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borschev</span> [ don’t remember exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">But anyways, it was — it was — people just were talking in wonderment, and si — and really trying to look to scripture for affirmation that those things will happen, and therefore they are happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I mean, that’s what I heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">That’s why the complete amazement of what happened, and how it was actually the — most of the peasants were really scared that such a thing could affect them forever, you know, in terms of the <span class="DLF">crops</span> and — and the growth in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">So there was also a certain amount of wonderment and fear, and it was like, did you see this? </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Tremendous wonderment. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And — and one of the reasons that, all those years later, 68 years, I want, before my time is up, I really wanted the kids to see that <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And it was nothing what I saw, and what I remember a-and felt, and never talked about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">QUESTION:  So how did your family survive the big massacre?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">ANSWER:  The big ma — I don’t — we were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">It was still in the same old <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , in same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but after that was over, there was rumors of sending the Jews to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> after this massacre, and we knew what other <span class="NPIP">places</span> they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">So — so here you have Passover in the spring, and by May and June, we were looking for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">My father October 8, 2010 went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Korolowka</span> to see if we could hide, if we could find somebody to hide us. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And then in May, the end of May or the beginning of June of 1943, we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borschev</span> as a family, and went into hiding in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Korolowka</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">QUESTION:  Can you describe how you were able to escape from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was not closed in, it was not — it was an open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">The — the thing, the Jews lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because there was no other <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">So di — you didn’t need a <span class="DLF">gate</span> or anything to close it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">There was an ordinance that nobody was allowed in or out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> except Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So, being non-Jewish looking and 10 years old, I was the one that would go in and out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with no complication except once. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">So I did the marketing for, you know, people would give me whatever, and I would do the marketing for our family and for people around us. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">So that’s how I-I — I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">There was no — no <span class="DLF">gate</span> or electric stuff or anything like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">QUESTION:  So aft —
ANSWER:  A-And nobody would — no Jew would dare live <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the prescribed <span class="REGION">area</span> anyways, because that meant — so no matter how much you complied, it didn’t make any difference, you died sooner or later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">QUESTION:  So, did you leave in the middle of the night, or in the day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">ANSWER:  No, no, we left about 10 o’clock in the daytime so we’d have enough — because Borschev walking is a long ways, and so we wanted to make sure that we had enough light when we — we didn’t get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Korolowka</span> , we got to some <span class="BUILDING">peasants house</span> , and October 8, 2010 from there they hid 1n the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And — and so w-we were six people, my fam — my mother, father, my two brothers and myself and my aunt, who survived from the big — from the Korolowka killings. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And we went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , and there were two or three other peop — families that we met up for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">We didn’t know, but we met up with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And by, I think August, the — the Ukraine police found out, and they were just two or three police, and they came into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and start shooting indiscriminately. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And somehow my father and I and my brother escaped, and my aunt was shot in the heart [indecipherable]
