<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Please tell me your name and where and when you were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My name is Peter Feigl. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I have Americanized it to Peter Ernst Feigl. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Ernst was my father's middle name. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I was actually born as Klaus Peter Feigl in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in 1929 on the first of March 1929. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">When I was about three years old I didn't like the name Klaus and insisted I be called Peter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Tell me about your parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  My father was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> in 1888 and was an Austrian citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">He served in the Austrian Navy during the first world war. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">He studied engineering and was a mechanical engineer and at the time I was born, he was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> working for a multi-national company that had <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> in a number of <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and that's, as I said, where I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My mother was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in what is today part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and I think it's in <span class="REGION">Silesa</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pomerania</span> and she married my father I believe two or three years before I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I don't have the exact date and according to then existing European convention and laws she became an Austrian citizen the moment that she married my father and I, although born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , automatically acquired the citizenship of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">So, I was Austrian also.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  How did your parents meet? </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Where did they meet and how and under what circumstances?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  That, I'm afraid I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I cannot tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I know that my father had been married before to an Austrian movie actress, I think, and they were divorced; but this was long before my time. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And I think during the period that I knew my parents and lived with them, I was too young for them to discuss these matters with me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  You said your father was a mechanical engineer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  Do you know very much about his family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  My father's mother, in other words, my paternal grandmother, was still alive when I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">She died around 1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">She lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">She had been a widow for many many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">She had two other children, two girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">One of the girls was named Minnie and she married an Austrian agricultural engineer and lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Innsbruck</span> from the time she was married until the time she died at about age 98 about two or three years ago in 1992 or '93 I believe she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">The other sister, Marianne lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and she never married, there is very little known about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">On a trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> last year in 1994, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Community Center</span> there and I found that in their archives they do have a record that she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> until about 1942 and the records show that she was then shipped eastwards and I believe to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> and never heard from again. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">So... I assume she was deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">My father's father as I mentioned died shortly . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I think when my father was six he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">My father's grandfather was a Rabbi I am told.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , yes, and I did find my paternal grandfather's <span class="DLF">grave</span> and my paternal grandmother's <span class="DLF">grave</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> last summer in July when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  Do you know very much about your mother's family and . . . (</span><span class="sentence" id="38">indecipherable)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  My mother's family, my mother's birth mother, real mother died in childbirth in 1904 when my mother was born and her father then re-married and the woman whom he re-married then ultimately came to live with us, that is in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , I guess that's the ttme when I remember her most vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I remember also visiting her occasionally in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> so I know she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> also. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">But then ultimately we fled together with her and my mother from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> later on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Do you know much about your mother's family, what they did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  No, not...
QUESTION:  What kind of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> they lived in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  They were born, my mother was born called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ottmachau</span> which obviously was a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">It's a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I'm planning to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> sometime next year and I'd like to go and see if I can find any records or traces there. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I did obtain a copy of her birth certificate from Polish authorities about two or three years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  And what was her name before she married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  Her name was Bornstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Bornstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">B-O-R-N-S-T-E-I-N and her mother's maiden name, that is the, not her birth mother but her, what I considered my grandmother, the maiden name was Kleczewer. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">The good portion of the Kleczewer family was very active in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> I believe her brother Siegmund Kleczewer was general manager of one of the major automobile companies in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I think is was called Autounion. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">They ultimately wound up in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">They managed to get to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in the late 1930s before the war started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  What are some of your early memories of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  I remember much talk about someone named Hitler at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">There was a lot of. . . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">there was some whispering going on in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">There was I remember one incidence where for a period of five or six weeks it was very difficult for my mother to obtain any milk, eggs and butter in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and Hitler made a speech and promised them butter and eggs and the next morning the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were full and I remember my parents saying that this was manipulation of the people that most likely Hitler had just prevented deliveries from being made in order to get better control and maintain a popularity among the masses. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and my first <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was in a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I don't have any, I can't remember anything unpleasant having happened to me at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I know that there was talk about the Jewish problem and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">My father basically took the position that this doesn't concern him nor his family because we were Austrian. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">This is a German problem not an Austrian problem and so he didn't feel very concerned about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">As a matter of fact, because he represented a number of foreign manufacturers, he was for some time courted by the German authorities to assist them in obtaining materials which they couldn't readily have access to. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">One of the companies that he represented was an American company called Champion Spark Plugs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  What kind of business was your father in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  The company was named Danish and Friedmann. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I don't know whether it was an Austrian company with branches in other <span class="BUILDING">companies</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I don't know where the home base was. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I think it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> but they did have <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> among other <span class="NPIP">places</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , of course, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and my father traveled extensively throughout Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I remember his coming back from trips to <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> and bringing my mother "attar of roses" which was apparently a very expensive perfume at the time, rose extract. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">But he did travel extensively.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  Does he... was it an automotive kind of thing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  It was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobile</span> primarily in the automotive parts and accessory business. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Another company, an American company that he represented, manufactured brake linings, I don’t remember the name of the company and all types of automobile accessories. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">They then later on also got into the business of handling radios, that is for home use and there was also an American radio company called Detrola. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">D-E-T-R-O-L-A. We had several Detrola radios at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that he had brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as samples.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  Your mother stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="81">You were the only child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  I was the only child. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I was an only child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  And you had a nice life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  We were very comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">As far as I can remember at least in 1934 or 1935, I think we had at least two servants in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my father drove a big fat <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">If I had it today, it would be worth a fortune and we lived a very very comfortable life going on summer vacations either to the <span class="DLF">seashore</span> or the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> or travelling to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">We lived well. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">No question about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">We had a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> at first. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Later on we moved into an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> before we left and we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> until about 1936, until about the middle of 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  You mentioned that your father's attitude was that he didn't think that what was happening applied to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Were your parents observant Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I mean there was . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Judaism was not practiced, no religion was practiced. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I remember as a child, I think the only time that I ever set food in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was for the wedding of a friend or a relative of my parents and apparently I scandalized everyone when in the middle of the ceremony I loudly said to my grandmother, "Grandma, look at my beautiful brand new black patent leather shoes." </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I seemed to have interrupted the ceremony but that's about the only thing that I can remember about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We never had a menorah tn the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or mezuzah at the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">This was unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">The only other symbol or connection to Judaism if you will was at Easter time, at Passover time, there was usually matzo at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> which my father used to love. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">He loved to eat and also it was broken up into pieces and put into a bowl and then you poured coffee, milk and sugar on top of it and eat it that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  Did you, as a child, did you know that you were Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Did you think about that at all? </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Did you have Jewish friends or was it just not a concept that was mentioned?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  It didn't mean anything to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">It was not something I was aware of. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I don't recall ever having been harassed 1n <span class="BUILDING">school</span> while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> during the first year. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">The name Feigl is a very common Austrian name and if you look in the Vienna telephone book today, you'll probably find something like 30 or 40 Feigls listed there spelled the way ours was spelled. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">F-E-I-G-L. F-E-I-G-E-L would have been a more Jewish name but G-L was a typical Austrian name, almost as common if you will, as Smith in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  Can you tell me how it was then that you all came to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Do you remember very much of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Yes, about '36, mid-'36, my father was told to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and close down the <span class="BUILDING">branch office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Apparently, this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> didn't do very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">It was not profitable. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So, the entire family moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and the move was totally unrelated to what was going on politically in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time and we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I certainly found myself thrown into a Czech-speaking environment which I apparently picked up within six months, I was speaking Czech in 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I was seven years old and we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> for one year and then went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">When I say back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> to my father's birth place and where what I thought was the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the company and established residence in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and it must have been in early 1937. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">At that point, the problem of Jewish persecution and so forth must have concerned my father because at that time he decided to have me baptized Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Over 95-percent of the Austrian population is Catholic and he thought that as an Austrian being a Catholic certainly couldn't do me any harm and so at the age of nine, I'm sorry, eight and a half, I was baptized by a Cardinal Innitzer. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">He had arranged to have the Cardinal baptize me and I went into <span class="BUILDING">catechism school</span> and basically thought of myself as Catholic at this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  This was the first religious training that you had?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  That's right, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  Did you go to <span class="BUILDING">mass</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  I, well, I went to mass for communion when it was required and for confession and so forth in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Subsequently, I didn't go because my parents didn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Later on in the 1940s when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and various <span class="BUILDING">children's homes</span> and so forth, suddenly being Catholic became useful again and in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> where the children were marched off to go to <span class="BUILDING">mass</span> in the morning, I tagged along and then some <span class="NPIP">places</span> I was even, was alter boy and served mass.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  Were you in a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  Yes, I was in a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and I guess about one year until the Anschluss came in March of 1938 when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> annexed <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and at that point my father actually on the day of the Anschluss was outside the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> on one of his many business trips and my mother was hoping that he would remain abroad so that he could send for us but after struggling for three days, my father managed to appear back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> triumphantly that he had managed to smuggle himself back into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> on a cold <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> , inside a cold <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> , coming out of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and he was all covered with soot and looked like a chimney sweep and there he was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Do you remember him...
ANSWER:  I remember it because it was a big fight between my mother and my father at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">My mother was furious that he had returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">She thought he was an idiot for not having stayed abroad and just calling for us to join him and he on the other hand was trying to defend his actions that he couldn't just leave us and abandon us and there was no guarantee that he could get us out and that's what he gets for struggling and risking his life to come back to get us. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">It was a big argument. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I also remember that on the day of the Anschluss in 1938, so I had just turned nine years old, I left that morning and we lived in the vicinity of the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Vienna Rathaus</span> and I went down there and I saw these tens of thousands of people on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and all the German flags and the music and the band and everything else and I was in there with the mass of the people shouting my head off like everybody else, "Ein volk, ein Reich, ein Fuhrer", one people, one Reich and one leader and I actually saw Hitler on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> up there on the <span class="BUILDING">Rathaus</span> and when I finally got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , my mother was beside herself, she didn't know, "Where have you been? </span><span class="sentence" id="137">You've been gone for six hours you know?" </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And I said, "I saw our Fuhrer." </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Where upon my mother slapped me left and right and said, "Never call that SOB again ‘Our Fuhrer’. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">He is not 'Our Fuhrer'." </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And I guess that's the first time that I came to the realization, wait a minute, some how I don't fit in, we don't fit into the grandiose schemes of this maniac but as I said, at nine I really, I wanted to have a uniform like all the other kids who were going, who were joining the Hitler Jugend. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">You know, and have a little dagger and sand brown belt and march to the music and the drums and all this is fascinating and hypnotizing for a young kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But shortly after that I think within a matter of two weeks, my father managed to get himself transferred to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and we immigrated hurriedly and left most of our property in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and fled to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  Do you remember were there other relatives, what they were thinking at the time? </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Were there discussions among the family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  I was a child and in those days children were told you're here to be seen, not to be heard and I really . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I cannot recollect any discussions about the dangers and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I don't think that this 1s something that dawned on me until we left very hurriedly from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I believe that my father at some time, some where got the German authorities mad at him because he refused to cooperate on importing some materials which they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I think it was aircraft engines to which he had access and I believe that they were trying to get him to import aircraft engines either into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> or into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and then transship from there as <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">agricultural machinery</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I know the Versailles Treaty that ended World War I, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was prohibited from importing any war materials and so forth and he felt at the time that as an Austrian, they couldn't harm him and he more or less told them to go to <span class="NPIP">hell</span> and he then realized that now that the Germans are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , I'm probably on their black list and they'll want to get even which I think was the primary motivating force behind his leaving hurriedly and getting out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  What about your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> during that Spring of that year? </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Did the teachers talk about, do you remember any mood or change? </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Was it obvious to you as a child that something was happening or not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  I can't really say that I remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I mean, yes, all of a sudden there was swastika flags in the <span class="INT_SPACE">school room</span> and Hitler's picture was up on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> but other than that, no, I remember that I wanted to be like the others and I knew that the large majority of my classmates were either joining the Hitler youth or other activities and my parents sent me to the boy scouts and I didn't think that their uniforms were as attractive as the uniforms of the Hitler uniform, so. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">But...
QUESTION:  Did the other children taunt to you in any way for not joining? </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Do you remember that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I know, I think in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> I think, a couple of times I was busted in the nose by some of the kids in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> who called me a Jew and it really upset me because my answer was I'm not a Jew, I'm Catholic but other than that I can't really say that I was aware of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  But they were somehow?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  I guess they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Obviously anti-Semitism was rampant but I also know that at one point my mother was paraded through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> after the Anschluss and they hung a sign around her neck saying that this pig woman bought in a Jewish- owned store and my mother apparently tried to tell them that she was Jewish and they wouldn't believe her. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">They paraded her through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> with a sign around her neck.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  Who did this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  I guess the local Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">It was just a few days after the Anschluss. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I also remember my mother being very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">We had moved into a brand new <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">At that time it was brand new and downstairs on the street level there was a small <span class="BUILDING">grocery shop</span> where you got your essentials, milk, butter, essential food items and so on, a small <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and, of course, my mother when we moved there they immediately recognized that she was German by her accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">She didn't speak like an Austrian like in Viennese and the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> owners always engaged her 1n conversation and were somewhat differential to her and I know that quite often the conversation turned around Hitler, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the shop keeper would always say to my mother, "Well, just let him try to come here into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , we'll show him, we'll throw him out in no time." </span><span class="sentence" id="172">On the morning of the Anschluss, when my mother went downstairs to get her milk and bread in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> , the first thing that the man greeted her with was Heil Hitler, Frau Feigl, and my mother was astonished. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I mean overnight this man suddenly became a Nazi and as she left the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> she looked in the <span class="DLF">window</span> of the <span class="DLF">door</span> and there was a big sign, "From today on the Germans salute is Heil Hitler." </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And the other day prior to that it was always, as the Austrian say, "Gruss Gott", which is little translation is "God be with you" or "God's Greetings" and from one overnight it because Heil Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I also remember that across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from us 1n our <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> and everywhere there were swastika flags that hung from the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> or the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and it reached to within four or five feet of the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I mean, humongus flags. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">This obviously was something that didn't just happen overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I mean, this had been anticipated. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">It had been prepared and so forth but I also remember that the night before the Anschluss, my mother was listening to the radio and apparently the Austrian Chancellor at that time, made a speech and I remember my mother being in tears about it at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">But again, I didn't really understand the political upheaval of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I just knew it was upsetting to her but I didn't know exactly why or what.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  With all these outward physical expressions of the change, the flags and the rally and the shopkeeper must have been impressing to you as a young boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Clearly it made a strong impression upon you that you still remember visually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  Oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">It turned a drab routine life, if you will, into a <span class="DLF">stage</span> , okay, there was a performance going on, something lively and to a young kid attractive and the masses were engaged and you asked yourself, well why can't I be part of this, you know, what's wrong here, why am I being left out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  I want to ask you about the boy scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">What did you do in the boy scouts? </span><span class="sentence" id="188">your parents wanted you to do in the boy scouts and not in the Hitler Jugend?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  I think basically the boy scouts were outings on a Saturday usually, and you played games, sports and you learned a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">You learned to build a , how to build <span class="DLF">rope bridges</span> and how to tie knots and I learned how to sew which later on came in handy, and all the things that boy scouts generally do, singing, camp fires, things of that nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  Did you go for hikes in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  We went on different hikes and so forth, yes, and pitching <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> , camping.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  Were those kinds of things new to you or had you done them with your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  Yes, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">These were totally new. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">They were really not part of our normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">The idea of vacation or what have you was staying at a <span class="BUILDING">luxury hotel</span> somewhere and being waited on and catered upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  Did you like it? </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Did you like the boy scouts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">ANSWER:  No, not much. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">At first I didn't like it at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I think now in retrospect, I realize that I learned many skills and many things that subsequently helped me but at the time I really resented going because that's not the way I wanted to go, I wanted to be elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  What did you want to be doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  I wanted to be with the other kids and the Hitler youth or stay at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Why am I being sent to the boy scouts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  Were the other boy scouts also Jewish boys?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">In fact, the boy scouts in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> were strictly Catholic boy scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">In <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , later on, and in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , boy scouts were broken down into Protestant scouts and Catholic scouts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  Is that what it was called, boy scouts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  Well, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> yes, in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> it was Pfadfinder, okay, "Pathfinders." </span><span class="sentence" id="213">In <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> the Catholic scouts were called "Scoot", in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> they were "Scoot de France." </span><span class="sentence" id="214">The Protestant scouts in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> were called "Eclaireurs de France."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">QUESTION:  What other kinds of things were interesting to you as a young boy? </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Did you read a lot?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">ANSWER:  I read a great deal and I think that also in later years helped me get ahead career wise and otherwise because my schooling was interrupted repeatedly. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I mentioned going to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and from one day to the next, suddenly finding myself in a <span class="BUILDING">Czech speaking school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">When we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> it was back to a <span class="BUILDING">German speaking school</span> and in 1938 when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> from one day to the next, I found myself in a <span class="BUILDING">French speaking school</span> and in the beginning, of course, I didn't speak a word of it so I had to, the first thing I had to do was learn French and Flemish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">QUESTION:  I want to ask you, before we go to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , did you have cousins and other relatives, other children your age that you were close with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I was an only child, a spoiled only child and my wife can confirm that, I'm spoiled but I really had no relatives and in fact, to this very day, I have a great difficulty in understanding what is a cousin and a nephew because I just didn't have any so about the only concept that I understand is an aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">My mother's sister, okay, I knew that she was an aunt but go much beyond that, get into the feel of cousins and nephews and nieces and so forth, it just doesn't convey anything to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">QUESTION:  Were your father's family pretty close with them? </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Did you get together on holidays or birthdays or anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  Well, with my father living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and his mother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and his sister, well one of the sisters, the older sister living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Innsbruck</span> , it wasn't that easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">This was in the days before <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and I do remember very very long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> rides from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and much longer still from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Innsbruck</span> , those were usually overnight trips in a <span class="INT_SPACE">sleeping car compartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">But we did go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Innsbruck</span> at least two or three times that I can remember to visit with my father's sister and there was another aunt, okay, Tante Minnie and Onkel Harry. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Her husband, by the way, was Christian, he was an Arian and he helped her survive the period of the Nazis and Onkel Harry was a big strong strapping guy and I remember his carrying me on his shoulders, hikes in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I remember <span class="DLF">salt mines</span> that we visited once where we went through, yes, we did get family visits in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> of course, usually my other aunt Marianne, his youngest sister, would come and be in his mother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> when we visited. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">But those were major expeditions in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I mean, you didn't just hop on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and in an hour you were there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">QUESTION:  So you were, the three of you together were a family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  You were very close, your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">ANSWER:  Yes, I was very close.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">QUESTION:  What about the decision to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="238">You mentioned a little bit about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Talk about going to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">ANSWER:  Well, as I mentioned I think my father quickly came to the realization that either the illusion that he had created for himself that as an Austrian, the problem of the Jews was not his it was a German problem and now he suddenly found that there are no more Austrians and he was a German Jew at this point and certainly by the definition of the Nazis, which made it a racial definition rather than a question of credence and belief, and then also I think I remember discussions between my mother and my father about, you shouldn't have done that when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and I think that that related to the fact that he more or less reyected some of the inducements or enticements that the Nazis had offered and I think my mother felt that this is going to haunt you some day and now is the time, they are here to haunt you. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">They are going to come and get you and I believe my father, because of that, managed to get a transfer to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and to get his assignment to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and he left first and we followed a few weeks later. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">We followed and we settled into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> at that time and he would commute daily from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I think that <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> at that time had a very high speed mass transit system and you could move from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> in less than an hour and so every morning he would go to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and commute to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">QUESTION:  He went ahead and found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for you to live?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">We moved first into a small <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> , and then later on into a larger <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">The smaller <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> later was occupied by my grandmother, my maternal grandmother, who also came to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> at about that time and she is the one that we subsequently fled with from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and she ultimately made it to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  She had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  She had also been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">QUESTION:  Is she coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">But I don’t know how exactly or when, she obviously went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> directly to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> rather than through <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and it's only speculation on my part, possibly she may have been asked by my mother to come and join them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  Do you have any recollection about the trip from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , passing through customs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">ANSWER:  Only, yes, only that the border crossing was very traumatic to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Everybody had to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , stood in <span class="DLF">line</span> for quite some time, every piece of luggage had to be put up on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> there for control people, inspectors, I don’t remember whether these were customs people or Gestapo people but they went through every piece of clothing 1n the suitcases and checked everything possibly looking for smuggled jewels or money or whatever and it took a long time to get through the inspection and when we were finally allowed back into the railway cards and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> got moving into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , I think there was a big sigh of relief on the part of everyone that they had made it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">QUESTION:  Did you and your mother travel . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  It was just my mother and I at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">QUESTION:  And how much did you have with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="260">What did you have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">ANSWER:  I can't tell you exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">My guess 1s we must have had four or five suitcases or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I know that, of course, when my father left he must have also managed to take along at least one suitcase I know of because he had, which was at the time, a very novel suitcase, it was sort of an expandable thing with expanding hinges and I think he probably mentioned that he, I think he bought it in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and that 1t was an American invention, very fancy leather suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">He had that all the way until we ultimately met again in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So I know he got that suitcase out of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> when he left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  But you all immigrated legally?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  That was a legal immigration out of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and I'm sure that it was made easy by virtue of the fact that my father had a foreign assignment from an Austrian, now German company since <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> overnight disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  Well I'm sure your mother was quite frightened for whatever reason that she may not be able to imagine, she couldn't get back to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  Yes, there was that, although perhaps a word about my mother here. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Between my father and my mother, my mother was by far the stronger of the two persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Both physically stronger. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">She was much taller than my father and my mother had been a gymnastics teacher and I think also as far as inner character, inner convictions are concerned, I think my mother was the stronger of my two parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">My mother was also about 16 years younger than my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So there was quite a considerable age difference which by the way was very common in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">My wife, for instance, [PAGE 19 ENDS HERE -- THEN JUMPS TO PAGE 35. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">PAGES 20 THROUGH 34 ARE MISSING] BEGINNING OF PAGE 34: never had a case like that, go to the prefecture. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">So she goes to the prefecture and goes through the same routine and they send her back to somewhere else and after about four or five times of being sent from one to the other, someone finally said to her, ah Madame, we know exactly how to deal with cases such as yours, there 1s a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , it's called Olorons St. Marie, it's in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">You go there and they know exactly how to deal with cases such as yours. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So with the little money that my mother had left, she buys a railway ticket to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olorons St. Marie</span> for herself, her mother and for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olorons St. Marie</span> and as we arrive at the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is surrounding with French Gendarmes with machine guns and they take us off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and put us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and the next stop was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French concentration camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp De Gurs</span> and we found ourselves in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> was a camp in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees mountains</span> which had been built in the 1930s by the French to house the fleeing Spanish, mostly community people that fled the Spanish revolutionary war and suddenly this camp had been turned into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">holding camp</span> or a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">It was not an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">For all these refugees, now most of these refugees who were in that camp now, aside from the Spaniards that were still there were now Jewish refugees getting German Jews, French Jews, <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , Belgian Jews, Dutch Jews, whoever was able to flee was in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="284">My mother, this is 1940s, so she is about 36 or 38 years old, she was in her prime and as I said she was physically very fit, she was immediately picked to become a barracks chief. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So as barracks chief she had a lot of freedom within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> that is to move from <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> or to move from one I Lot, as they call them, or <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was sort of divided into <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> and she was responsible for going every day to pick up the food that was allotted to our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So, she knew what was going on in the camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">She was well informed about the happenings and so on and we basically were in wooden <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> with just straw on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> , no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> or anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">A lot of people were hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">There was not enough food to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Obviously, the French had not anticipated an influx of that many people and they were totally unprepared for handling the influx of people that suddenly showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">The conditions were miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">The <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> were open trench latrines, there was no hygiene. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">There was no running water. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">A lot of people got sick and, of course, again, a lot of the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> were elderly people and children and women with children and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So, we were in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for I guess it was about almost six weeks or so, close to six weeks and my mother had a run-in with some nuns that were put in charge of the food supply and as <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> chief my mother tried to beg, plead, borrow anything to try to get an extra ration of bread or an extra can of sardines or an extra something in each <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I think each <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> held about sixty to seventy people that she had to feed and one of the nuns lectured her and said, Madame, you do not live to eat, you eat to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Whereupon my mother hauled out and slapped her. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">It did get her an extra supply of rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Anyhow, after about six weeks or so, when the French were about to surrender in late June of 1940, my mother learned that there was a Wehrmacht, a German army inspection group that was expected the next morning at the camp and this is where the passport thing comes in. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">For some reason, my mother's passport had not been stamped witha "J". </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So my mother said, I want to get out of this damn <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="302">We've got to get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">We'll starve to death in here. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">She went to the main <span class="DLF">entrance gate</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in the morning when the Germans were expected and as soon as she saw the head of the German group, she went over to him and yelled, "Heil Hitler Herr Oberst. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I am a German citizen, I demand to be released from this stinking, filthy camp immediately with my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">These damn Frenchmen have kept us locked up here for six weeks." </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And she showed her passport to him and he just looked at it and looked at me and my mother had her mother's passport and opened it up and with her passport on top of it, she was hiding the "J", and the German officer was so taken back, he just turned to the French camp commander who had come in there, then said, "You let Madame out immediately with her mother and her son and you call a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> and you make arrangements with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> that you pay for him and he takes them wherever they want to go." </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Within five minutes, we were out. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">My mother told the driver, "Just take us north and drive as fast as you can." </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And he did and we drove.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">QUESTION:  You witnessed this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I was standing by her. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">She had taken me along and obviously she was all packed and ready to go, she figured it's either going to work or it won't. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">We drove for several hours and came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auch</span> , A-U-C-H, which was a little bit in the area <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> , in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and as we approached the <span class="DLF">city limits</span> and the <span class="DLF">town limits</span> , we were crossing <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> , and all of a sudden a group of people came toward us and waved at us, and said, "Stop, stop, don't go any further, the Germans are on the other side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="316">So, my mother looked around and she saw that there was a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> off there to the left side of the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> and so she took our bags and me and my grandmother and dismissed the cab driver and we walked across the open <span class="DLF">field</span> over to the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and she knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and the nuns took us in and for the next six weeks we lived in this <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Whether the fact that I was Catholic had something to do with it, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I don't know whether my mother played that card or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I really don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">But the nuns did take us in and during the five or six weeks that we spent in the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , the nuns made contact with various, or they were 1n contact with various refugee assistance aid organizations and among them a group of American Quakers who had a food distribution and <span class="BUILDING">refugee assistance office</span> in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So my mother was offered a job with the Quakers to help in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">It was a part-time job but it enabled her to leave the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and find a one-room apartment and moved into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">My mother also earned extra money becoming a cleaning lady and now at this point I don't remember what happened to my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">She somehow left at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I don't know what but she left us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auch</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">QUESTION:  Do you know why’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">ANSWER:  I don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I think that she must have somehow managed to contact her daughter, the other daughter, the younger one who had lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and somehow, at some point, she managed to rejoin her and managed to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Now, I think it had something to do with the fact my aunt's husband, the one she married in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , his name was Joel Bloomberg (ph), he was called Jole Bloomberg (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="330">He was very active in Zionist activities and so forth and he was, I think a Latvian or Lithuanian nationality so he had a passport from one of those <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and at that time those <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> were not yet involved in the war so he was, if you will, a citizen of a neutral <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , my aunt had acquired his nationality when she married him and I think that that helped them to obtain the necessary visas and he had been traveling back and forth on Zionist movement activities to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and to many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> throughout Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I think he was a lecturer also and lectured in many <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">So he had a great deal of mobility, if you will, and I think that's how somehow they managed to get her, my grandmother, to join them and to ultimately come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I think they made it to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> about 1941 or so before Pearl Harbor, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I know they spent a great deal of time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> waiting for both first their visa and then their passage. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">There was limited <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> available on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">QUESTION:  Do you know what organization he was with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">ANSWER:  No, I do not. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">He, as I said, he did make it to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and I remember in conversations, his name had been mentioned on a few occasions and they say, oh, yes, we know Joe Bloomberg (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So, he was quite active in the, I would say in late '30s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  Do you remember when your grandmother left you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">ANSWER:  No, I really don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I just know that all of a sudden I have no memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I know that she was gone and so I know that we lived in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> alone and now my mother's frantic search started to try and find out where is her husband, where is my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">She turned the world upside down through police, Gendarmes, the International Red Cross, the Quakers, anyone who would listen, she would try to find out whatever happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I think it was several months until she finally found out where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">He had been transported from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">They then went to the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> whose name I cannot think of it right now, and from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Cyprien</span> which was on the <span class="REGION">Mediterranean coast</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">So now we knew where he was, we started to get letters, he had apparently taken to quite ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I think they call it here, water in the legs, I think it was a heart related situation and of course, inadequate medical care and so forth and somewhere around 1940 or early 1941 his physical condition had deteriorated to such a point that the French authorities decided to send him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on a convalescent leave, figuring that within the next 30 days he'll die and he might as well die outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> instead of in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and save us the cost of burying him. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I think it was in the Spring of '41. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">It had been a terrible, terrible winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was flooded. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Where my father was, there had been bad floods. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">They had typhoid outbreaks, I believe and a lot of people died during that winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">So, he then came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auch</span> and joined us in a one-bedroom apartment, a one-room apartment, and he then was able to stay with us literally by a month by month basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Each month they wold renew his thirty-day convalescent leave and extend it for another thirty days and sometimes for sixty days and he had to find some means of earning a living and he couldn't accept a job because nobody would employ him. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I mean he was not a French citizen and didn't have the right to work unless he created work for himself so his old experience with Champion Spark Plugs, he found a <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> where they had a spark plug cleaner which 1s basically a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">metal stand</span> with a can full of sand at the bottom and you hook it up to a high pressure air hose and then you take a dirty spark plug and just put it in at the top and the air blows the sand into the spark plug and it cleans it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">So since it was impossible to get spark plugs anyhow at that time, he had a great idea and he started a spark plug cleaning business, a one-man operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And he was able to earn a little bit of money that way doing that sort of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">My mother continued to work with the Quakers and in 1941 in the summer through these connections I was sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake Annecy</span> which was very pleasant for me, the food was good and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">This is obviously something that mother had managed to arrange through these aid organizations that she was working with and the word Quakers kept popping up, the Quakers, the American Friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">In 1942 in the summer, she again arranged for me to go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> during school vacation and this time I was sent to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> about thirty miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auch</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Condon</span> and there was a chateau and there were about thirty some odd kids there at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">QUESTION:  Before we go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , do you remember your father coming back? </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Do you remember when he arrived?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">ANSWER:  Yes, he looked terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I mean he must have lost a good fifty or sixty pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">He was literally skin and bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">In one of my diaries, I have a picture of him, a picture that had been taken in order to apply for a visa so a passport-type photograph and when you compare that with what he looked like, a year and a half before, it was like day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">He was a little bit on the heavier side before then. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">He enjoyed good food and so he was totally emaciated and he seemed to have aged fifteen years or something like that in that time period.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">QUESTION:  How did he get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auch</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I assume either by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or a combination of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">QUESTION:  Did you meet him someplace?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">ANSWER:  I don't remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I think I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when he came back and I ran <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">So, my mother must have met him or I don't know exactly how the reunion took place but I saw him again for the first in a year in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">QUESTION:  You had been separated for a year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  We had been by then separated for almost a year, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  It must have been very nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  Yes, it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">But, I also realize that there were big problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">It was a very small one- room apartment. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">There was no privacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I remember my mother basically sponge bathing in a little basin of water she would stand in and I remember seeing her naked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I mean, there was no other <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">So, to literally you live there, you Slept there, you cooked there and so forth, but my father suddenly became a farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">in the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> there was cages and he raised rabbits in there for food and there were a couple of chickens that provided a few eggs and he planted potatoes and string beans and peas and so forth that he showered a lot of attention and love and so forth on them and tomatoes to provide us with food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="389">QUESTION:  In that couple of years, with the three of you living in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , what was your parents outlook? </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Were they just saying let's just be happy here and stay here or were they...
ANSWER:  No, that's a good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Their reason for going on, for living was only one thing and that is to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and get a visa and go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Especially after they had learned that my grandmother and my mother's sister and my uncle were already in <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> waiting to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">My parents wanted to do the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">My father had approached his business contacts in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , Champion Spark Plug. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">There was another company called Styckgold and Stackgold that they had extensive dealings with. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">It was a company in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">He wrote to Mr. Styckgold and he wrote to Mr. Stackgold and invariably we wish we could help you but... and it was very disturbing for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I still have many of the letters that they wrote to my grandmother after she came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> which my grandmother left to me when she died and it's a very sad story listening to what my parents had to say at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">There were utter frustrations for them, they found themselves in a chicken and egg situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Yes, we will give you a visa to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , if you have a visa for <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> , yes <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> said we will give you a visa to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> provided you have a visa to go on to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Yes, you can have a visa for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> once you get your quota number but we're not going to assign you a number until you can show us that you have booked passage on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">The shipping company said we will not book passes on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> unless you first have a visa to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I mean it was, they were just constantly running up against this kind of a problem or you must come up with so many hundred of dollars which today would be equal to in the tens of thousands of dollars to ensure that you have a priority on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> or to ensure that you get a visa or you get a passage or what have you and they didn't have that money. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">We lived pretty close to the poverty level in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auch</span> so it was hopeless. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">He kept writing to, my father and my mother both kept writing to my relatives in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> at that point and they had just recently arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">They were basically penniless. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">My father would tell my grandmother, you've got to telephone Mr. Styckgold, you've got to telephone Mr. Stackgold. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I've written to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">You've got to get in touch with Champion Spark Plug's management. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">They know me. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">They've dealt with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Talk to Mr. so and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Talk to Mr. so and so and it was just all in vain, nothing but frustration. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">So, those were very very difficult days for them again, they did everything in their power to shield me from this such as sending me off to these <span class="REGION">children's colonies</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camps</span> and so forth and this brings us basically to the 1942 period and it was in 1942 that the Germans in cooperation with the French Vichy government decided on their policy to round up the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">The French thought that well, if we're going to round up Jews, let's first try and round up the foreign Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">That way maybe we can protect the French Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">The French Prime Minister, Laval, when the Germans asked that they round up the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , he only asked for the adults and Laval said, please take the children too. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">You want to keep the families together, don't you? </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And the Germans said, no, we don’t want the children and Laval insisted until finally they said, well alright we'll take the kids too but there was basically something that Laval, Frenchman, was pushing for and at this point, July, let's see, end of June, early July, just before I left for the children's colony, school vacation starts on the fourteenth of July generally in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">So, I know I remember that there were a lot of whispered discussions going on in our one-room apartment. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">There was a lot of worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I would pick up words about raffles, razzigs, they're rounding up people. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">People are being shipped off, nobody knows where. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">So, I was somewhat aware of something was brewing and that there was danger here but then came vacation time and I was sent off and I was with other kids and forgot all about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Sometime in early August, my father came to visit me at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> and he made a very long trip on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , thirty miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">QUESTION:  Do you want to take a break?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER:  No, it's okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">For a man who was sick and he came to visit me and I remember on the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> he had square cookie box and out of the cookie box he produced a small bag that my mother had sewn and it contained my father's pocket watch and he had a black fob with a gold Buddha attached to it and his silver pencil which he was very proud of, he had gotten it in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">It was sort of a four color mechanical pencil and a ring from my mother, a broach, a few other items, a small amount of money and he gave it to me and told me to look after it and at first it didn't register with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Why are they doing this? </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Why is he doing this? </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And after he spent a couple of hours with me, he climbed back on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and headed back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auch</span> and as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> disappeared over the top of the <span class="DLF">hill</span> , the crest of the <span class="DLF">hill</span> , I broke out crying and somehow I had the feeling I would never see him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">It was a few days later, maybe ten days, four days later or so that the director of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a very kind woman, Mrs. Cavaillon, she called me to her <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and she announced to me that she had bad news, she had been informed that my parents had been arrested in Auch the day before and they didn't know where they were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">There was no information and I was obviously very upset and she was a very devoted, very religious woman, a Catholic woman, and I had been going to <span class="BUILDING">mass</span> almost daily. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">She encouraged everyone to go to mass everyday and this was not a camp for Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I think I was probably the only Jewish child there. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">These were all French children from I would say middle or lower middle class families who found a <span class="BUILDING">summer home</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">She also told me that they were going to hold a novena, nine days of prayer and after nine days, my parents would be returned to me and there was nothing to worry about. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">A day or two later I was again called by her and I was told that they are going to have to make me sick because she had a phone call from the police, from the gendarme and they alerted her and told her that they had received orders from Auch to come and pick me up but if they come and they find me ill, so ill that I cannot be transported, then they will leave me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">QUESTION:  That's what they told her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">They told her that. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">So, they induced a fever in me and I'm always asked, how do you do that and they took some French bread and made balls out of it, like meatballs and soaked them in vinegar and I had to swallow about eight or nine of these vinegar soaked bread balls and sure enough within a half an hour or forty-five minutes, I was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with a high fever and when the police came, they took my temperature and they verified and certified that yes, he is not fit to be transported. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">So, that saved me that night or that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">The gendarme came back on two or three other occasions and each time the same thing was played. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">The same act was laid out. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">During that time period...
QUESTION:  Let me ask you a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Do you think that they, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or the Germans called for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">ANSWER:  No, it was the French.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">QUESTION:  The French...
ANSWER:  The round-up was conducted by the French police at the bequest of the Germans, of the German authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION:  When they told her that if you were ill they were informing her how to save you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER:  This was a good Frenchman, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">There were some decent people there and some people who felt that it was not right to round up children. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">This is 1942 so I'm now thirteen, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">They didn't like to do that kind of a dirty job. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Une Sale Corvee, a dirty deal, a dirty job we have to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So, they protected me in that fashion if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">During that time period, Mrs. Cavaillon was in touch again with the Quakers and I'm sure that her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> probably got some support or some money from the Quakers also so that she knew whom to contact and through the Quakers I believe she then learned that's where my parents had been sent to. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">They were first sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vernet</span> , a placed called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp du Vernet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">It was somewhere in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> which was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">assembly camp</span> and then the next postcard, I think a postcard came actually to the summer camp from my parents advising that they were being sent to <span class="REGION">Paris region</span> , to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">The nine days came and went. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">My parents didn't return. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I started to have some doubts about catechism and all other faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I raised a lot of questions and strangely enough the priest told me to go and talk to the archbishop, a thirteen year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">It's only today that I realize that this was most unusual that they would do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Normally, a thirteen year old doesn't go talk to an archbishop and I vented my doubts and frustration and questions and he basically said to me, he said, well there is no answer to these questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">This 1s where faith comes in, you must either believe or you don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">But there is no explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="469">QUESTION:  What were your questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">ANSWER:  I had a lot of questions about how can God, how can Jesus allow these things to happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="471">What have my parents ever done to deserve this? </span><span class="sentence" id="472">What have I done and if I'm being punished, what is the punishment for? </span><span class="sentence" id="473">I also started to ask some fundamental questions, okay, if God created the world, who created God? </span><span class="sentence" id="474">If there was nothing, than he couldn't have been here. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">How is this possible? </span><span class="sentence" id="476">So, basically I turned my back to religion at this point and I haven't come back to it yet, maybe on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">death bed</span> but for the time being, I don't feel the need for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Now came the question, where do we go from here? </span><span class="sentence" id="478">There was one bit of information that was received from Drancy saying that they left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> for a destination unknown and about this time, we were now moving into, this was late August that they were arrested, I think it was August the 24" or 22", somewhere around that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Now we are moving into September and <span class="BUILDING">school</span> starts up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> can't remain open, what to do with young Peter Feigl and Mrs. Cavaillon came back one day and announced to me that the Quakers are organizing a children transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Children that would be going to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and there would be two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> , the first one will leave around the middle of November and the second one about the end of November or early December, 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Ultimately, Mrs. Cavaillon arranged for me to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">In fact, she took me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">In my diaries, there are entries also about a trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">There must have been an <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> or something where I went, I was questioned there and I underwent a physical exam to make sure that I didn't carry TB or whatever to infect <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and there were forms to fill out and sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Ultimately, I wound up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> somewhere around either the end of October or very early in November. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was scheduled to leave, the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> I was told I'd be on the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> and it was supposed to leave somewhere around the 20"" of November. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">On the 10" or 12” of November, the Allies landed in <span class="REGION">North Africa</span> and this gave the Germans the pretext to invade the so-called free zone of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , Vichy zone of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and the <span class="DLF">port</span> was closed and no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> leaves. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So, now the people looking after us scrambled to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to house us and I wound up in a small <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">There must have been about 15 or 20 of us outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Les Caillols</span> and we were more or less prisoners in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">The people who had taken us in obviously, again hadn't been prepared to have us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I, in a typical kids fashion said, I’m going to get something to eat, and I found out that the Germans had established a, there was a Waffen SS detachment that occupied the <span class="DLF">farm</span> across the <span class="DLF">road</span> from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">So, I said, I'll talk German and I'll get some food out of these guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">I'll get chocolate and what have you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">QUESTION:  You know what, we're running out of tape here. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">So, let's hold this story and we'll tell it at the top of the next one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">QUESTION:  (inaudible)
ANSWER:  Fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  Okay, we're back. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">You were going to tell me again the complete story of your stay with the other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">You haven't been allowed to go or to leave from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">ANSWER:  Well, I wound up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or <span class="BUILDING">home</span> which was run by a Belgian man and woman, in fact I think in my diary I noted that they got married while we were there but they were sort of the then mother and father if you will, looking after us. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">The food was very difficult to come by at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I'm sure in part this was due to the fact that they hadn't anticipated taking 15 or 20 kids and with the Germans occupying all of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , what little food there was, was number one the Germans take priority on all food supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">When I found out and noticed that across the <span class="DLF">street</span> there was a <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> there and the detachment of Waffen SS had moved in with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored personnel carriers</span> and so forth, I said, well I speak German fluently, I'm just going to go over there and chat up the Germans and I'm sure I'll get some chocolate or something out of them and I'll be able to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">So, I went across the <span class="DLF">street</span> and sure enough I chatted them up and I guess my first contact they didn't ask me any questions and then I came upon a German captain there and the captain said, what are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="507">What's a German boy doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I don’t know whether this 1s something I had learned from my mother but I said to him, shhh, you mustn't talk to anybody about this, this 1s very secret what I'm doing here. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I mean, here I'm thirteen years old, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">He said, well where are your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I said, oh, my father is 1n the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">He's in the secret police and we came to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> on a so-called business assignment and my father has been spying on the French for several years and I go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">French school</span> which is why I also speak French fluently and my <span class="BUILDING">French school</span> mates don't know that I'm spying on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">So, I wasn't asked any more questions by the German captain after that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">QUESTION:  Did he believe you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">ANSWER:  He believed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Either they believed me or he was scared, what if it's true and my father really is in the Gestapo? </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Maybe they could get into trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I was very well fed and I got to eat spaghetti and I got chocolate. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">No complaints at all until about three or four days later when the director of the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where I was suddenly found out that I had been across the <span class="DLF">street</span> and he then proceeded to ship me out in a hurry because he was wotried that I was endangering the other kids there. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">But again, I was thirteen and I think of number one and I didn't really realize that I could possibly endanger anyone else. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">So, although my protestations, I was shipped to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I think after a number of days, after the lesson had sunk in, then they took me back at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Les Caillols</span> , where I had been before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">QUESTION:  Could you connect for me, what happened with your parents with those soldiers or was it just something separate?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">ANSWER:  They were something completely separate to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I just didn't connect it. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I just didn't connect it. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">At this point, I had been without news from my parents for now a couple of months, two and a half months, and I was being moved around from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">There was a lot of discussion about what to do with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Actually, the first discussions about my going to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the Department of Haute Loire in the massive central had come up already. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Oh, well, I think while I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Condon</span> , before my parents were arrested, there was already some discussion there whether to send me to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Then, now in late November, early December, this became a more pressing question for the people looking after me and the decision was taken, to move me to Le Chambon Sur Lignon, but it was too dangerous to move me at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">The <span class="DLF">roads</span> were being watched by the Germans and by the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">There were all kinds of passes, identity paper controls and so forth and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were being watched so it was decided to move me over the New Years holiday, over Christmas New Years, that there would be a relaxation of surveillance and I think it was on New Years Eve or on New Years Day that I was actually moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> to Le Chambon Sur Lignon. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">According to my diary, I think I got there at about 2 o'clock in the morning or something like that and was met by a man named Daniel Trocme'’. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">He was the cousin, I believe, or the nephew, I'm not sure, as I explained earlier about relations of the pastor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , Andre Trocme'’, and we had a long long walk in a cold night and wound up finally in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , in an old stone <span class="BUILDING">house</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Les Grillons</span> , which was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and breakfast-type <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , okay, a pension, as they call it in French.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">QUESTION:  Now was he at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">ANSWER:  He met me at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Yes, he met me and picked me up at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> but from the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Les Grillons</span> was a good four or five kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I mean, it was a long hike, up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> too, up the <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So, I now find myself in this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> together with about 15 or so kids in this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Daniel Trocme' was our shepherd who looked after us. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">He was a younger man, he was probably in his twenties, mid- to late twenties. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">He looked after us and the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> really is the full detail, as I didn't become aware of until a few years ago, of ten to fifteen years ago, but the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> apparently was a conspiracy to protect people and the people in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> are about 90-percent Protestants, fundamentalist and people who, as they put it, lived the Bible, lived by the Bible and their pastor gave them the needed inspiration on the day that <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> fell and surrendered to the Germans by telling his congregation that it is the responsibility of every Christian to resist the occupier with the weapons of the spirit and that's where subsequently the title of a film about Le Chambon came from, Weapons of the Spirit. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> has a total population of about five thousand people during the period of about three years, actually hid and saved five thousand people, almost on a one-on- one basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">These villagers never asked who you were or whether you were Jewish or not or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">They took you in. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">They fed you. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">You never had a situation of people saying, well, I wish I could help you but we don’t have an empty <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> or no, they opened up their <span class="DLF">doors</span> and they shared what little they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I always liked to, when I tell about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> to Americans, I try to make them understand that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">European farm villages</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">farming community</span> is quite different from the American one in that the people of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> live clustered, very close together, one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> next to the other, there's no big <span class="DLF">yard</span> , no acreage between them. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">The people look across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , a narrow <span class="DLF">street</span> usually, and if they see the lights going out in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , they know perfectly well it is ten past nine and they know that they count in twenty seconds a light will go on on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> on the third <span class="DLF">window</span> from the right and that's the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and the light will be on for three minutes and thirty seconds and then the light will go out so you know exactly what your neighbor is doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">You know his routine. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">You can't escape it. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">During that period, lights went on and <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> where lights were never on at night and lights stayed on in <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> way past the normal times and nobody ever reported this to the police, nobody ever betrayed anybody and that's truly remarkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And you must understand that the people did this, this did so knowing fully well that if the police were to find out, they wouldn't just arrest the person that they were hiding but they were subject to arrest as well as the entire family and their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Confiscation of their property, of their goods and deportation to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camps</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">So, what these people did, they did it at the risk of their own lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">So, I was hidden there for about ten months. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">During that period, they also saw to it that our education was not completely neglected. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">There was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Le College Cevenol</span> , which had been created as a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> before the war and they saw to it that we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> every day and that we get on with our education. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">It usually meant long hikes from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived down to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and on the way back, we usually came back up with supplies in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">It was difficult to get shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">For example, Daniel Trocme' would scrounge worn out old tires and he would cut up the old tires and make soles for sandals out of them and by putting holes into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tires</span> and stringing rope through them, he would make sandals out of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Something that is very fashionable these days, I see a lot of kids walking around with these black sandals. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">It was a rugged <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="564">It was at about an elevation of about three thousand feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">The winters were very very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Lots of snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Most of us had frostbite on the hands, on the fingers and on our toes. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Partly because our clothing wasn't really that adequate but it also had a lot to do with the fact that our food was inadequate. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">There wasn't enough fat content in the food and most of us were deficient in a number of nutrients and so forth but just about everybody was frostbitten fingers or toes. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Durith that period, there was an organization there, individuals who specialized in forging papers and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">QUESTION:  Local citizens?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Some of the local citizens, some of them were part of the group of refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">In other words, either the people that they took in were not just children, they were also adults, some husbands and wives, there was even a German deserter from the German army that they had taken in. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I had befriended him because he spoke German fluently so we would speak German together. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">He was a, I remember as very tall, pale looking, very soft-spoken, gentle type guy who must have been eighteen or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">He deserted them. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">He decided to desert. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Anyhow, in order to make room for other people in need, there was a full underground railroad, if you will, operating and if they could pass somebody as a Frenchman, and send them out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to some other safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> , safe <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , if you will, then they would do so because then they would have more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to take on more new people that might be in need and since I spoke French fluently without the trace of an accent, ultimately I was given some French identity papers, false name, forged ration tickets, coupons that you had to have at the time and so forth and I was sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Figeac</span> in the lot department as a boarding student, 1t was <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> students in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> during that time were quite numerous and common almost in every <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> because you couldn't commute, there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">school buses</span> so anyone who lived let's say five miles or more away from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the parents would just have the child boarded in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at least for the week, if not for the entire semester. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">So, I lived as a boarding student in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Figeac</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="581">QUESTION:  Before we leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> , I would like for you to talk about that ten months that you were there, what was the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but what was your daily life like, with the other people, who were the other young people that were with you, what were you aware of in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , did you have a sense of town mood, people were there from other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , or did you just think it was your group of people, tell me about what it was like to live there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">ANSWER:  They tried to keep us busy first of all. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Now during the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> months, between walking to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , coming back with supplies, doing your homework, by the time you were finished, it was time to go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and get ready for the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Our stay occasionally would be interrupted, our activities would be interrupted by suddenly someone saying, ah, we're going to go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> for a hike and at the time, I didn’t know the reason why and this is something that I found out later on, periodically the police would tip off people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> , and tell them we're coming up there at 10 o'clock to round up or look for Jews or look for people that are hidden up in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , get them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">So, they didn't tell us the reason, they just told us, we're going to go and pick mushrooms in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> or if 1t wasn't mushrooms season or we're going to go for a nature hike, a little walk and sometimes we would stay in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> for six hours, eight hours or something like that and then we would come back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and everything was fine and dandy. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">We didn't know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">During the summer months, there was a lot of hiking, a lot of tug of wars and games that were organized, occasionally, we would be visited by Pastor Trocme', Daniel's relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">The Pastor was the inspiration and leader of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and the groups 1n the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which I was, was a very mixed group, there were boys and there were girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Among them were some Spanish refugees still, children of Spanish parents, of Spanish origin whose parents obviously had fled Franco, <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> during or after the revolution and found themselves in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and were either orphans or were persecuted for one reason or other. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">There were some people from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="591">There were some German Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">There was a young Frenchman who I am sure was not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">He may have been an orphan. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I think he was an orphan. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">He became a very very good friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">He died of TB up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">We were very close friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">So, 1t was a mix of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">There was an Italian woman who was the cook, who cooked for us and she had a daughter there also. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Her daughter was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I really don't know why they were there, what the reason was. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">But, as I said, it was a very mixed group of nationalities. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">I collected a lot of photographs which I kept and practically all of these photographs were passport-type pictures that were taken by the people who were creating these false documents, these forged documents for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">But, they gave us an extra supply of pictures and when we learned that we might have to leave, we would start exchanging photographs and give a souvenir to our best friend by dedicating the photograph to him or her and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I was able to take a lot of these photographs with me which I shouldn't have but we'll talk about that later maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">But day flowed into day, occasionally I would inquire whether anything had been heard from my parents and by now, I think I came to the realization that there was a program afoot in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and so forth to deport Jews, deport them to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or east to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">The name <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I hadn't heard of it yet and so as time went on, let's say that my hopes faded too and I just kept on. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I was of course cut off from any other relatives at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I had no idea whether my grandmother, uncle and aunt had made it to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and if they did, I wouldn't know where or how to contact them. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">I had some relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">I had mentioned Kleczewer earlier who was the managing director of the <span class="BUILDING">German automobile factory</span> there in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">I knew that they had made it to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> but I had no idea where they lived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">So, you just sort of went along from day to day to see what tomorrow brings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">QUESTION:  Were you at that time, that ten months, did you feel safe there, and were you anxious, were you feeling sorry for yourself or did you feel that you and the other people there were all going through the same thing, I mean you were fourteen and you were alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">ANSWER:  It may sound stupid, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">But, I had a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Okay, I mean, there wasn't that much food but we had buddies, friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">We could go out explore things in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , pick mushrooms, pick blueberries, pick wild strawberries, we could run down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">brook</span> and bath in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">brook</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">There were as a matter of fact, there were also some boy scout activities going on and for the life of me I cannot remember but it was brought back to me when someone a few years ago suddenly produced a photograph of a group of Jewish scouts, okay and I'm right in the middle in the front row of them and the moment I saw the picture, I recognized myself, I knew what I was wearing, okay, the clothes and I remember posing for it but to this day, it's blocked out, I don't know exactly how I got there or what the occasion was but I know it was me. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I mean, I know I was in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">So, that's a mystery to me but as I said, I never really felt that I personally was in danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I always went, at the time and to this very day, my wife can tell you that too, it drives her up the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , but maybe those war years taught me to be this but I don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I don't worry about things that I cannot control. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">If somebody is going to come and arrest me, what can I do about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Worrying about it isn't going to make them go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">So, until it happens, I go on with life and I do what I want to do or what needs to be done and that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">As the Italians say, Que. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">sera sera, what will be will be, but don't worry about things that you cannot control and I think that was my attitude even later on as I fled across the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> and we were being shot and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">I mean, I , you get hit you get hit - worry about it then, but until then .. . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">As I said, it may be stupid, but I think that it has helped me a great deal in remaining sane, keeping my sanity and keeping my wits about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I just don't go to pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">QUESTION:  Were you aware of other people who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> other than the people who were with you, did you ever have opportunity to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and mix and...
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I'm not going into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and mixing. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">About the closest that I might come to mixing with others was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I knew that some of these classmates also were Jewish refugees hidden from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or wherever their origins were but I didn't know where they lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">We didn't exchange addresses, if you will and we would meet in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> but there too, they basically kept us busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Okay, they kept our noses to the grind stone and there wasn't that much dialog going on and when it came to any kind of recreational activities and so forth, we pretty much did it within our own group in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">We played with and we stayed together, that group. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">So there wasn't that much contact with other groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">We knew of other <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> or <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and we knew that there were other kids living there but we didn't know who the kids were or what kid lived in what <span class="BUILDING">home</span> so, and there were no organized activities to bring the kids from one <span class="BUILDING">home</span> together with the kids of another <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">QUESTION:  You had occasion to meet Andre Trocme' and his wife also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">ANSWER:  I met Andre Trocme', well first of all Andre Trocme' came and visited at <span class="BUILDING">Les Grillons</span> on several occasions. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">At that time, again, I certainly was not aware of what a splendid individual this man was and he was just one of the older people who were looking after us. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I met Mrs. Trocme' about ten years ago or so after the war when I went to <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span> and so she appears in that movie I mentioned, Weapons of the Spirit, and so, but the Trocme' family is remarkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Daniel Trocme' by the way is one of the very very few people that was arrested by the Germans and sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and killed because the Germans simply could not believe that an Arian, a non-Jew would do what Daniel had done and so he is one of the very few people that was arrested in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> and died. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Andre Trocme' was also arrested together with the principal of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , someone named Theis and they were locked up for thirty days until for some reason the Germans released them after thirty days. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">They came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> and continued their good deeds, their good work. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">It's a fascinating . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> is truly a fascinating story. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">I think it has a lot to do with the fact that the French Protestants of course, had been severely persecuted back in the 15th century and these were descendants of the original French Protestants, the Huguenots they are called. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Many Huguenots fled to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to what later became the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">But the French, basically the French Catholics were out to exterminate them and the ancestors of the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> managed to clamber up on this <span class="DLF">mountainous plateau</span> and it was the beginning of the winter and the pursuing French soldiers probably said, well let him croak up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Nobody can live up there anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">But they survived and in their church services and in their, what do they call it, they have a song that they sing which 1s sort of reminiscing or singing about their origin and their past suffering and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Whenever they get together, they like to sing that song. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">It's like an anthem or a hymn to them, if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">It mentions, it talks about teaching the children about the past, the need to teach them, to let them know what their forefathers went through.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">QUESTION:  Were you aware of any of that at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">QUESTION:  No?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">QUESTION:  You mentioned that you had good friends who became ill and you were fourteen that year. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Did you have any girlfriends while you were there? </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Did you have that. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">ANSWER:  Well, I think I fell in love with a couple of girls but I don't think that I had any, I mean, I never expressed my love and there was no kissing or hand holding or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">I think I was considered much too young at the time and so I never... I just think that this was my first love, you know, but there was never any physical contact or a relationship there. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I think we were all pretty young and pretty square in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">You just didn't do those sort of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="669">QUESTION:  But it was a group of people that pretty much stayed together the whole time you were there, the ten months?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">QUESTION:  So you knew these people pretty well by then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="672">ANSWER:  Yes, but even there, even in a small group like this, the people tended to form clicks, groups and the age range also was quite broad. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I think the youngest one in our group was probably ten or eleven and the oldest must have been sixteen or seventeen so although an age difference of four or five years, let's say may not be much when you're fifty, sixty or seventy. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">When you're a teenager, one year of age difference or two years, that's like a generation apart and so you had on the one hand the older kids that would stick together with the older kids and then you had a further breakdown of people gravitating to one another by language group. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">The Czechs, okay, there were three or four of them that were Czechs. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Well they would get together and speak Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">There were three or four German origin and they would get together and speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">The Spaniards and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">So you had these clans of groups that would form. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I was a loner. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I really didn't click with any group and this French boy, Amede Dutoit was his name, he was even more of a loner than I was than I was and I think that's why the two of us got together and we got along quite famously. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">But he was an orphan and I think he was very sickly and he was probably brought up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> because they thought that the mountain air would be good for him and in those days people with TB were sent to <span class="BUILDING">sanatoria</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and so forth and so that's probably what brought him up there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">QUESTION:  How were you to find out that you were to leave there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">ANSWER:  I think that my being sent away came in conjunction with Daniel Trocme's arrest. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I think when the German's arrested Daniel Trocme'’, a) there was nobody else to take over at that point and they had to disperse the kids and I think b) they also were concerned that since Daniel was in charge of Les Grillons, anyone at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Les Grillons</span> might be easy prey and I think the decisions must have made, I'm assuming here, that we better disperse these kids and close down Les Grillons. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I think Les Grillons supported, if not totally financed, it was supported by the Quakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">The Quakers had very close ties with Pastor Trocme'. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Trocme', before the war, had been a pacifist and draft resistant. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">He refused to serve in the French armed forces and urged other people to refuse to serve in the military and that's one of the reasons why they assigned him to <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span> , which was a forlorn, God-forsaken place up there and they figured he wouldn't get headlines as he was getting in whatever <span class="BUILDING">parish</span> he had before. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">That he was in a larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and the Protestants felt that his vociferous and noisy speeches about draft resisting and so forth are not helping their cause. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">So they assigned him to <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon parish</span> and got him away from the headlines from the journalist and then he became the moral leader of <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">He never told people what they had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">He never told them you must hide people or you must take them in and there were, this 1s another one of the puzzling and remarkable things. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">It wasn't managed where somebody says, okay, we're sending this guy here and that guy there and the next five who come in are going there, no, this was all spontaneous. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">The people just knew what they had to do and did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">In his sermons on Sunday, went back to the old testament to fundamentalist ideas and concepts. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">If someone is sick, you go and visit them. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">If someone is hungry, you give them something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">If someone is homeless, you provide them with a shelter. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">So, that was basically what drove these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">QUESTION:  Do you remember seeing Germans in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">ANSWER:  I remember seeing Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I know that there were some German soldiers who came on convalescent leave so it was sort of a R & R rest and recuperation place and I don’t remember how many but there have been about forty or fifty or so who occupied one or two <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> there and if I remember correctly, they had all been wounded on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> and so forth and they basically just wanted to get well and they didn't want to have trouble with anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">They pretty much kept to themselves and some historians who have looked into the past, into the history of Le Chambon, think that that may also be one of the reasons why there was no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">These soldiers had gone through <span class="NPIP">hell</span> on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="706">They didn't want to start hunting Jews or anybody else, just leave me alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Everyday that I can stay away from duty on the front somewhere, so much the better. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">So, I had no trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="709">QUESTION:  Did you ever go to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they were making all the false documents? </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Did you see the operation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">ANSWER:  Not that I know of. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="713">QUESTION:  They provided you with what you needed to leave there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Basically, the false names, the false identities that they gave us generally were the first name would start with the same letter as your real first name. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">The last name would start with the same letter that your real name was. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Your birth date would remain the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">The place of your birth would be changed so that they would drill into what's your name? </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Okay, and make sure that you don't come up with your real name but that you come up with your new identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">That, however, if your initials or if you were to start writing, you would naturally start writing the first letter of your first name P and hopefully by then you realize that it's not Peter or Pierre but it's Paul, okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">QUESTION:  Who did this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">ANSWER:  Apparently, according, from the film, the Weapons of the Spirit, there was a particular individual was quite adapt at producing and forging documents at creating official stamps and so forth and he apparently was the primary individual who did this. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">But he must have had help, that's true.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">QUESTION:  Do you remember someone coming to you and telling you what your new name was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I remember being given a new identity and the papers and they were making sure that I understood that I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luca</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , okay, the last place of <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> was with my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auch</span> but my birth date was still the 1° of March, 1929, and they took me through this repeatedly and made sure that somebody asked me what my name is, that's what it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">QUESTION:  Did they come to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> you were living and did this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">ANSWER:  Yes, at <span class="BUILDING">Les Grillons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="730">But, again, I mean, some of these things, you know, later on when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Figeac</span> , I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I had to take German, a mandatory course and I was first in class and I was correcting the teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">The teacher's German was atrocious. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Of course, in retrospect, it was stupid of me, okay, but it never occurred to me at time and to this day I still have a copy of my school transcript in my report card and the German teacher wrote down in the comments, very good student but must be careful not to fall asleep on very easily gained laurels or very easily acquired laurels. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">He knew perfectly well that German had to have been my mother's language, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I mean, that must have been obvious to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">So, I was very lucky.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">QUESTION:  You left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> in the winter?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="738">ANSWER:  I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> , I think it must have been in December of 1943 or January of 1944, so I had about ten months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Figeac</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there, the <span class="BUILDING">College Champollion</span> , there were, I think, three or four other kids who had also come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I think two of them I knew from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Two of them was in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> as I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Another one, the other two came from another <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="742">So, again, here you have a situation where undoubtedly the principal or whoever was in charge of that <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> knew perfectly well that he was accepting some students of questionable background but they also protected us. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">The interesting thing about the Figeac episode 1s that I became involved at that point in resistance activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">The Germans used the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">schoolyard</span> as a <span class="DLF">parking lot</span> and at night a couple of other guys and I, we would scrape together whatever sugar we could find in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cafeteria</span> , in the <span class="INT_SPACE">canteen</span> and so on and we would pour it in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gas tanks</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German trucks</span> and the next morning, we just loved to watch them try to get the engines started and started, and if they stayed in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> long enough, and after about fifteen minutes or so of idling, all of sudden the engine stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">The engine was all gummed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">We enjoyed it even more when this happened and then they drove out of the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> right away and we knew that about a half a mile down the <span class="DLF">road</span> , they're going to get stuck. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">We would slash their tires and force them to change wheels and so forth on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Somehow the Germans didn't enjoy this very much and they started to play pretty rough in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and started to round some of the kids up and so forth and some of the teachers must have been in contact with the Maquis of the French underground and I was called out a few times to help them with translation, translating German letters or documents that they found. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">At a certain point also, the Maquis attacked the only major <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which was a <span class="BUILDING">propeller factory</span> making propellers for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German fighter planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="750">The Allies had tried to bomb that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> repeatedly and they could never succeed because it was geographically in a very awkward <span class="NPIP">location</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="751">It was in an elbow of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , a bend of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> on both sides so they couldn't attack it by dive bombing and they could only try to hit it from high altitude and they never could and it was a critical <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> because it was the only <span class="BUILDING">research factory</span> in the world at that time that were producing those kind of variable pitch propellers. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">So, the Maquis was asked to go and blow it up and I tagged along with the group the night that they went into the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and I think it was ten or eleven plastic explosive charges that they planted on the equipment used to make those propellers and destroy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Shortly after that the Germans then came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and rounded up all the male citizens between the ages of sixteen and fifty-four, I believe it was, and shipped them off to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Now, I happen to have learned just last summer that because I went to a commemoration of a round up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Figeac</span> last summer, I found out that the division that came and rounded up everybody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Figeac</span> , it was the same division that two weeks later destroyed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of, I can't think of the name of it, a <span class="DLF">mental block</span> , anyhow it will come back to me, they rounded up all the people, shot them and of the people that survived, they were mostly woman and children and babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">They were bundled off into the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and they then set the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> on fire and then burned them alive and three or four of them tried to escape through the <span class="DLF">window</span> and they were shot as they tried to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">It was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour Sur Olane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Okay, and it was 638 people who were killed and massacred there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">QUESTION:  The same division?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="759">ANSWER:  The same division, the division Das Reich. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Figeac is in the Department du Lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">It's near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhone valley</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="762">I think it's south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> , southwest of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="763">QUESTION:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> is north?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="764">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> is further . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">no, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> is also south. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">It's in what was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">My wife and I drove through it and we suddenly saw that, the road sign, and we stopped in there and visited. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">The French decided to leave it as a <span class="DLF">memorial</span> and didn't touch a thing in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and it was left just the way the German's left it at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">QUESTION:  But they came and they rounded up...
ANSWER:  So they rounded up all the male citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="770">QUESTION:  And you were just below the date?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="771">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">I was just below. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">This was 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I'm now 15 but I wasn't going to take a chance and when they came, I made a <span class="DLF">bee line</span> for the adjoining <span class="BUILDING">church</span> where I had gone before and I had been an alter boy and so forth and I used that as part of my cover.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="775">QUESTION:  Adjoining it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">ANSWER:  It was literally adjoining. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">I mean it was sharing a <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">So I was able to climb on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and from the <span class="DLF">roof</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I was able to slide over onto the <span class="DLF">roof</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and from there I made my way through the beams in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> into the church steeple and I spent the next 24 hours in the <span class="BUILDING">bell tower</span> just waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">I could see from there, the troops and the Germans and I waited until they cleared <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and then I came back down again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="781">QUESTION:  How did you hear about this round-up? </span><span class="sentence" id="782">They were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and the word spread?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">ANSWER:  The word spread immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">The word came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">I mean, everybody immediately was alerted to it and at first they didn't know why but everybody was told to report to the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="786">All the males within 16 and 54 were ordered to report to <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> by 1 o'clock or something like that, but especially some of us Jewish refugees who had heard stories of round-ups and raffles and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">We knew it wasn't to give us medals or hand out checks. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">I wasn't about to take a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Again, selfish but I looked out for number one. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">I disappeared 1n the church rafters and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And fortunately, I knew the layout in there, having been in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> as an alter boy you get to, you have the free run of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and you know the layout and where the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> are and <span class="DLF">ladders</span> that go upstairs and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="792">QUESTION:  Now what happened after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="793">ANSWER:  Well after that, when the dust settled, I came back down and now it becomes a jumble. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">There's an organization named Haias and the UJF, which was a French- Jewish organization, and again the Quakers, there were a number of refugee assistance organizations whose names I kept hearing and someone visited me then in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and told me that I was to get ready, that I may have to leave, they didn't say where yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">Then I think, the departure date was set for me about three or four days later and it was cancelled and then it was postponed to another day. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Ultimately, I was given a railway ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">I was told to pack a backpack and to only carry what I could put into the backpack to sew my birth certificate and the Baptismal certificate in the lining of my jacket that I had and told to go to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> , take a specific <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and get off at a specific <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and that there someone would approach me and they would tell me what to do next and that's what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , got off at a small stop somewhere near the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> , it turned out, right near the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> , was approached by a young man about 25 or 30 years old or something like that who told me to follow him and he was a, what the French call a passeur. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">A boarder passer. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Usually they did it for money. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">Maybe this guy did it out of personal conviction, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Normally the passeur, you hired them to guide you and help you finally spot with little risk of crossing the <span class="DLF">border</span> illegally.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="803">QUESTION:  We'll just break again. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Let's pick up here on the next tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="805">ANSWER:  Fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">End of Tape #3 Tape #4
QUESTION:  ... It has been sent there, you have new papers, you have a new identity -- what's your new name? </span><span class="sentence" id="807">What is your new name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="808">ANSWER:  Under the false name that I had been using? </span><span class="sentence" id="809">It was Fesson, Pierre Fesson. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And it's with, with the identity, with that false identity that I traveled with in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , with my birth certificate, with my real name, and baptismal certificate, which was basically a stamp on the back of my birth certificate, sewn in the lining of my jacket. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And I had been instructed that when I get to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to produce the real papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">So the name of the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">It's in my diary. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">I wrote 1t down. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And last summer, in 1994, my wife and I, in fact went to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to that very same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="816">And the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> 1s still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">It looks still the way it did at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And I retraced the steps leading towards the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Anyhow, at that time in, we are now in May of 1944, about two weeks or so before the Normandy landings, late May, 1944 there were other people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , there were kids on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that I was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And they somehow failed to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> that we were told to get off. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">So problem number one was that I got off, they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">I wasn't going to tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I had no way of knowing whether they were told to get off at the same <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , or another <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">But the first thing that the passeau, after he identified me, said to me, he said, "These stupid kids failed to get off at their <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="825">We have to wait until they get off at the next <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in order that they're brought back here." </span><span class="sentence" id="826">So ultimately, we were rejoined by these other kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">It was a couple of hours or so later. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And there were, we were about ten or eleven all told. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And he marched us first through open <span class="DLF">fields</span> , then through <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="830">It was drizzling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="831">QUESTION:  Did you have, were you taken from the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="832">ANSWER:  From the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , right. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">It was drizzling, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> was wet. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And he explained to us that he was going to walk us to within a couple 100 feet or so of the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> , that once we're there, that <span class="NPIP">spot</span> , that he would designate we are to lie down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and we should wait until the changing of the guards, and the changing of the guards would be, we could tell because we will hear whistles blowing and chances are we will hear some dogs barking and there will be some commands exchanged, but when they change, when the guard change takes place then you go straight from the barbed-wire fence, climb up over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , and when you're on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> you come down and you are not in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , you are in what 1s called the "no man's land", so don't stop, continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">Go across the "no man's land" to the second row of barbed-wire fences, then up that <span class="DLF">fence</span> , and on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">Once you're there, then your safe and you're in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="837">So he disappeared, he left us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And as I said, it was cold, it was wet, it was drizzling, we were just freezing and waiting there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="839">QUESTION:  Were you hiding in the <span class="INT_SPACE">stall</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="840">ANSWER:  We were lying in the, on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> , on the, whatever was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the, on the ground of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , pine needles, brushes, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="841">QUESTION:  There were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="842">ANSWER:  There were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , yes, lots of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> around. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">And we could see the, you could just make out the <span class="DLF">border</span> , the barbed-wire fence. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And periodically we could see soldiers walking in one direction or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And so around 1:00 o'clock, I think, afternoon, activity, the whistles, could hear some dogs barking, we said, that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And we jumped up, and we started to head for the barbed-wire fence. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">I upped first friends into "no man's land". </span><span class="sentence" id="848">Half way through the "no man's land" I hear people screaming, I hear some shots ring out. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">I don't stop, I keep going to the second <span class="DLF">fence</span> , and I go up. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Just about to start the second <span class="DLF">fence</span> , I see this outline, this silhouette of a soldier standing there wearing a <span class="DLF">field</span> , field-green, field-gray uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">My first reaction was, it's a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And then I looked again and I said, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">The, his helmet looked different and he was carrying his rifle in a fashion I had never seen a German carry a rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">This man was cradling the rifle in his arms like a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">So I, up on the second <span class="DLF">fence</span> and over it and he was motionless until I was on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and touched the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="856">Then he just motioned to me and said, "Get behind the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ," in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">There was a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And now I knew I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Well, apparently, what had happened is that some of the other kids, one a girl, got over the first <span class="DLF">fence</span> and she saw the soldier who I had seen, and she thought it was a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">So she thought she had made a wrong turn, or something was wrong, and she began to scream, "The Germans are there, the Germans are there," and she turned around to head back to where she had come. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">She became totally disoriented. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And two other people, equally confused, didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And during that period, the Germans started to open fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">So, I think, out of a group of about 10 people, seven of us, we made it across. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">I have no way of knowing what happened to the other three. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And once we were all safely behind the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , then the Swiss soldier went <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , picked up his telephone, called, and we waited there and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Swiss Army truck</span> came out about a half of an hour later, loaded us onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and took us to a <span class="BUILDING">refugee center</span> first. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">And I remember the drive into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="868">There were <span class="BUILDING">grocery stores</span> and so forth, and they had displays on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> outside the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="869">And I saw things I hadn't seen in four years, things called bananas and oranges and, I mean those, we didn't know, we had forgotten what they were practically because those are grown in <span class="REGION">tropical areas</span> and during the war years they just didn't come into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And so I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlaraffenland</span> , which is what you call it in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">It was, you know, the land of milk and honey all of a sudden. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And we, we were interrogated by the Swiss authorities and they were going to ship us back. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">But during my interrogation, I pointed out that my father had had business friends, business contacts in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and I remembered the name of one family, and I gave the name and told them, "I remember the name of the company in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> ," and I gave them the name of the company. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">So they contacted that firm apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">And the family said, "Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">We know Mr. Feigl." </span><span class="sentence" id="877">So they decided to take me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">So that enabled me to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">So I was given refugee status in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> , stayed with that family, they sent me to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="880">I was undisciplined at the time, created problems in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , was disruptive. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">After a year the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> wanted to get rid of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">With the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> wanting to get rid, get me out, expel me, the family had had enough of me, they didn't want me anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">So I was turned over to the Swiss Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">They placed me in a <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> for about two months until they found another <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">I was sent to another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Ecole D'Humanite'</span> , which was another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that was run by a saintly man who had studied in <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> and was a friend of Rabin Pra Nath Tagore, a famous Indian philosopher. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">He tried to apply some of his learnings, what he had learned in <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Again, I was being rebellious. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">I wouldn't comply with the rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">So after three months I got thrown out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">I was then sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> to a Ort school where they would teach me some mechanical trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">They found a Catholic family to, with whom I could live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="892">And after 60 days they couldn't take me anymore and they begged the Red Cross to get me out of their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and find some other <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I then wound up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">children's camp</span> , there were about 40 of us living in this large <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And I, during that period I was going to the Ort school. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And this 1s also the period during which, I guess when I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> in 1945 probably, or 1944, late 1944, early 1945, I first was able to reestablish contact with my relatives through the International Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">They had been searching for me and for my parents through the International Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And so I think I first heard from my relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , the Kleczewers. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And shortly after that I heard from my relatives in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , from my grandmother, my uncle, and my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And they then told me that they would enable me to get a visa to come and join then in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And ultimately, in 1946, in July of 1946, I did make it to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="901">My uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> insisted that I pay for my own ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">Since I couldn't pay for it, he advanced the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">But I had to sign a promissory note to rermburse him for the cost of the ticket, the voucher and the ship fare, which I repaid. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And I arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in July of 1946 with the same backpack that I had when I crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> and I had seven dollars on me and a change of clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And my English, basically, consisted of "The <span class="DLF">door</span> is open," "The <span class="DLF">window</span> is shut," "John is a boy," "Mary is a girl," with a heavy French accent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="906">QUESTION:  Let me ask you a couple of questions about . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="907">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="908">QUESTION:  You never mentioned being a discipline problem before. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">What was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="910">ANSWER:  I think it was just rebelliousness, it was just that, I'm now free, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="911">And you can't tell me what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">What do you mean I'm not allowed to take a girl into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rowboat</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And I'm not allowed to smoke here? </span><span class="sentence" id="914">You don't know what I've gone through. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">I've been smoking for years, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="916">You're going to tell me not to smoke?. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">Another house rule was you don't drink water during a meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">You only drink after a meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">That was part of the Indian teaching, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="920">You eat your fresh fruit, you start the meal with fresh fruit, when the stomach is empty and absorbs the greatest amount of minerals, and vitamins, and so forth, and extract them from the fresh fruit and, well, that's not for me, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="921">I eat my apple whenever I want to, and I would make a great display of getting up in the middle of the meal and going out into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and coming back with a glass of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And I would take a girl out on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rowboat</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> alone, and smoke a cigarette with her in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="923">So I, he just put up with it for so long. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And then, ultimately, he said, "This is too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Get rid of him." </span><span class="sentence" id="926">That was a very interesting <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">It was <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that was created by this man, Paulus Geheeb. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">He was a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">He started the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the 1920s, a very liberal school, unstructured basically, let the children learn as quickly as they are able to absorb it, let them spend more time on the subjects that are of more interest to them, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And he started the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="931">It was called the <span class="BUILDING">Oden Waldschule</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And when Hitler came to power Geheeb immediately felt that such a <span class="BUILDING">liberal school</span> would not be tolerated in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="933">So he packed up his <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , he was, he was Aryan, he was Christian, packed up his <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and established it in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And many German, many children of German leaders were sent for their education to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And when the war started, Paulus Geheeb decided that 50 percent of his students would be destitute, refugee children who he was going to take in. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And he also further decided that the parents of the other children would have to pay the tuition for the destitute children. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there with the, I think they were the children of the, or the nephews of Field Marshall Von Brachitz, a German general. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">He had two of his sons there. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And they were 1n that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together with Swiss children from wealthy families and other kids like myself, Jewish refugees, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">So we got along quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">It's just that I just wasn't ready to, to settle down at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And there's no question I was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And in some ways, I am still very difficult today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="944">QUESTION:  And what this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Tell me about coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="946">ANSWER:  Well, coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , it was very exciting to see the Statue of Liberty, and coming into the <span class="DLF">port</span> and into the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="947">And my uncle, my aunt, and my grandmother waited at the <span class="DLF">dock</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And they decided to take me on a sight- seeing tour of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> , and they pointed out the <span class="BUILDING">Empire State Building</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">Chrysler Building</span> , and <span class="DLF">Wall Street</span> , and <span class="DLF">Broadway</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Times Square</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And they were, I also disappointed them greatly, because I just said, "Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">Okay." </span><span class="sentence" id="951">I mean, I had seen it in the movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">So what's the big deal, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="953">I mean, I knew what the <span class="BUILDING">Empire State Building</span> looked like. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">So then they decided that what this young, emaciated kid needed was some rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">It was summertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">So they decided to take me into the Catskills. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And they were going to a lovely <span class="DLF">farm</span> there, very nice and quiet, and little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> and fresh air. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">And I wanted no part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">I wanted to get into the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and live it up, the big lights, big <span class="DLF">Broadway</span> , you know, what am I doing up here in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="960">I spent enough time in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="961">So that was another big disappointment for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And they wanted, then they said, well, I have to, I must go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And as far as <span class="REGION">New York State</span> was concerned, they had a board of regents, they evaluated the few school records that I had with me, which weren't many. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">I had one, one report card from my, from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> where I spent one year and I had one left over from Figeac with the false name on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">And the Board of Regents said, well, before we can give him credit for anything that he studied in Europe he must first pass a test of four years of American history and nine years of English. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">It was absolutely out of the question. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">I mean, I knew nothing about American history and my English was atrocious. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">I couldn't have passed a two-year English test at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">So my relatives then wanted me to continue either with the school work or learn a mechanical trade, or any kind of a manual trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">That was part of the refugee baggage, if you can call it that. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">By now, everyone had, everyone had learned that when you arrive in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> they would ask you what your occupation was, what your trade was. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And if you were a tailor, or if you were a sheet metal worker, or a mechanic, they put you to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">If you were an intellectual you went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="974">So they wanted to make sure that for the next time that this happens that I would be prepared and I would be among those who would be selected to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I didn't want that either. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">I, because I wanted to earn money. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">I wanted to have my own money and buy things, meet girls, take them out for a milkshake or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And so against their advice I got my first job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown New York</span> in a dye and tool making place, based on my experience and the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And they hired me as a, as a apprentice machinist. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I objected in my lousy English at the time and said, "I do the same work as the man next to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">Why am I being paid as an apprentice, and he's getting full union wages?". </span><span class="sentence" id="982">And so he promised me araise. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">And I waited for six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">And when the raise didn't come, oh, he, after six weeks he finally decided, okay, here's your raise. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">And it was five cents an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">And I asked him, I said, "Is that my raise?". </span><span class="sentence" id="987">And he said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="988">I said, "Forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">I don't want this job." </span><span class="sentence" id="990">And I took my coveralls off and I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">And again, my relatives were very upset about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And I said, "Oh, don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">I'll find another job." </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And three days later, I had a job at <span class="BUILDING">Montgomery Ward</span> as a mail clerk. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">I was earning 10 cents an hour more than I was getting at <span class="BUILDING">machine tool shop</span> , and it was a white collar job. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">I didn't get my fingers dirty, and I didn't come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with metal filings in my, in my skin, and that launched me on a white collar career. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">And from then on, I waited until I was 18, and on my 18" birthday I decided to join the Air Force. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">And I wanted to be a pilot. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">Remember when they were being attacked and shot at by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German dive bombers</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">I wanted to be a pilot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">So I went into the Air Force and, once I was in, learned belatedly that since I was not a citizen I could not become a pilot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Because to be a pilot you had to be an officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">To be an officer you have to be a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">So I was stuck in the Air Force. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And I was given the opportunity to go to any <span class="BUILDING">Air Force school</span> that I wanted to, except cryptographer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">Because, again, I wasn't a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And to get into cryptography, code breaking or code making, you had to, you had to be a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">So I picked three <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">And after I finished my basic training everybody lined up and received their assignments to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">And I said, "Hey, Sarge, how about me? </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">You didn't call my name." </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">He said, "Oh, you're a lucky bastard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">You don't have to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">So I was sent to Air Technical Intelligence at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base because I spoke French and German fluently, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">So I became a translator. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And that really was the blessing in because I had a lot of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">I spent three years translating or abstracting captured German documents that covered every branch of science you can imagine, from propellants to <span class="BUILDING">oil refineries</span> to aerodynamics, meteorology, and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">And with each new document I had the time to go to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , immerse myself in the vocabulary and the language of the <span class="DLF">field</span> and I learned a lot that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">I mean, a lot of it rubbed off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">And after three years in the Air Force I came out and had a difficult time at first finding a job, this is now 1950, and ultimately got a job with American Express Company as a translator at a ridiculous $35 a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">But I had a policy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">My policy is as soon as you have a job in hand immediately start looking for a better job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">And I no sooner starting working at American Express than I was looking at ten, twelve different other <span class="NPIP">places</span> trying to get another job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">And six weeks after I started with American Express I get a response to one of my job applications to do the same work I was doing in the Air Force for a civilian contractor back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wright Field</span> paying me $75 a week, going from $35 to $75 a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">That was pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">So I moved to, back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dayton</span> , Ohio, in 1950. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">And I did that for about two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">I warned my boss at the time that he wasn't looking after the business properly, that he's going to lose the contract. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">That is exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">And the day it happened, we were driving back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I saw a sign that said, "Your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">City</span> needs policemen." </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">So now, I'll become a cop, and took the Civil Service Test and wound up at the top of the list, and in spite of the fact that I was six pounds underweight they decided that because of my good test scores they will take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">So I became a cop for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">I saw a lot of things that I didn't like there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">First of all, they put me on the Vice Squad because I was unknown and I was a fairly handsome kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">So they thought that they'll use him to entrap people and what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">And I saw a lot of things going on in the Police Department that I didn't like. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">I mean, this was a time, this was in 1952. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">Most of the policemen in those days had a ninth grade education. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">They were dishonest, they were drunkards, a lot of, that was too much for me to stomach. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">And after eleven months I had a run-in with my captain, police captain, and he told me, "You don't make arrests in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you stay out of that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and leave these people alone." </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">I said, "Hey, wait a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">I took an oath to enforce the law equally, no matter who it is." </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">And if I did make an arrest, he would destroy my evidence so I had no case when it came to <span class="BUILDING">Court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">And I finally said, "The hell with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">I don't need this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">I quit." </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">And I became, my next job was as a, what is called an assistant manager for a personal finance corporation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">That's a small loan company. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">The assistant manager really is a collector, people who don't pay their loans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">Well, I did that for about three months and I couldn't stomach waiting for people to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with their paycheck and squeezing five bucks, or two bucks or what have you out of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">So I was looking for something else at the time and managed to get myself a job with Chrysler Aiv-Temp as an assistant engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">And don't ask me how I wound up as an assistant engineer and made now twice what I was making on the Police Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">About this time, the Chief of Police called me and said, won't I please come back? </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">If I read the paper tomorrow, I'll find that captain whatever his name 1s has decided that his health isn't so good, he's going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> to retire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">And I said, "Thank very much, Chief. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">But I'm now making twice what I was making before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">And I'm not working swing shifts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">I'm working on a regular schedule. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">Thank you very much." </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">And then I got together with a fellow who I worked with as a contracted translator. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">And we decided to try to get the contract ourselves, form a company and see if we couldn't get contract, the translation contract. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">So I found an organization, an existing corporation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newark</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , and convinced them that they should back us financially. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">And they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And they established a subsidiary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">And I became the general manager of the subsidiary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">And I was now making $100 a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">And we got the contract. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">The Air Force felt that they had been pressured in giving us the contract, and they killed us with kindness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">After one year the thing collapsed and I went looking for another job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">And I decided that there is no future in the translation business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">I got to get out of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">So finally, I got a job with Curtiss-Wright, which was an aircraft engine manufacturer at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">And I became, what the heck was it, I guess it was a, I know, engineer, engineering, a spare parts engineering liaison department, and it was analyzing engineering change orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">Anyhow, I told them that I was prepared to take a pay cut if they'll give me a chance, watch what I'm doing and if in six months I am performing as expected then I would expect them to raise my money back to my salary, back to what I was earlier earning before, if not I'll leave and forget about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">And four months later, they raised my salary back to the $100 a week and promoted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">So everything was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">I was with them for about four years, meantime looking for another job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1078">QUESTION:  Let me ask you a question here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">Clearly you made rapid success. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1080">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1081">QUESTION:  ... 1n business.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1082">ANSWER:  Can't complain.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1083">QUESTION:  You did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">And I mean, you had confidence...
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1085">QUESTION:  ... sounds like. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">You had your, always had your eye on something better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1087">ANSWER:  Better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1088">QUESTION:  What does that have to do with your experience growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1089">ANSWER:  I think all I can say is that the war years had taught me to stand on my own two legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">And I think my mother probably gave me some inspiration too, stand up for your rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">She used to have a motto, "Wenn man dir gibt, nimm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">Wenn man dir nimmt, schrei," which means, translated it means, if someone is giving you something, take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">If someone tries to take something away from you, holler. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">So, but I think, basically I think I had become self-reliant long before and realized if I don't do it, it’s not going to get done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">And I was very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">I mean, my wife keeps reminding me that luck plays some part 1n it too, possibly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">Looks probably also has something to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">I had more hair in the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">And I was tall, which also helps generally when people hire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">Apparently, subconsciously, they tend to gravitate towards a taller person, projects more authority or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">And so at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Curtiss-Wright</span> I next was offered a job with an aviation export company in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown Manhattan</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">And they needed a technical director, oh in the meantime I had paid, out of my own pocket, I had paid for pilot lessons and I had learned to fly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">I had gotten my pilot's license. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">And the technical director was also supposed to be responsible for aircraft sales and he had to have a pilot's license. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">So they offered me the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">I spoke French, German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">It was all international marketing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">When I told Curtiss-Wright I was leaving, they made, they asked me how much I had been offered by the company in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , I told them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">And they said, we will match it and add $1,000 to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">We want you to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">I went back to the man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and I said, I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">You won't believe this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">But they just matched your offer and added another $1,000 a year to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">And he said, "Look, I want you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">If you promise that you will come to work for me I will match what Curtiss-Wright has offered you and add another $1,000." </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">I said, "You got me." </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">So I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Curtiss-Wright</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">I spent the next four years with Aviquipo, a company in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">And during that time, again, I was looking out for something better to do and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">This, by the way, this job involved a tremendous amount of traveling overseas where I got to use my languages and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">I traveled all over world selling <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and ground support equipment for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jetliners</span> that were then coming onto the scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">And finally I was offered a job as a director of international marketing for, by a helicopter manufacturer up in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">And he offered to pay me 50 percent more than what I was getting in the previous job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">So that didn't take long, and I accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">And fortunately, I had a wife who went along with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And it wasn't easy for her, moving <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">But, so we moved to <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">And I was there for three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">And after three years of traveling all over the world again I came to the conclusion that this manufacturer, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Comman Aircraft</span> (ph), wasn't ever going to sell another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">helicopter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">So I went, I talked to the president of the company and I told Charlie Comman, I said, "I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">But as I see it now I don't think you have a Chinaman's chance of selling another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">helicopter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">You might as well take the money you spend on international marketing and flush it down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">It'll have the same effect." </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">He said, "Well, I appreciate your candor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">But you're telling me I don't need you anymore." </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And I said, "Well, I hope that maybe you can use me on the <span class="REGION">domestic side</span> or something." </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">He said, "Well, I'll keep you on the payroll until you have another job." </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">So I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">Of course, we're selling <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">helicopters</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military helicopters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">There were contacts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">And I called up an Air Force colonel I had been dealing with to find out whether the Air Force had succeeded in, it was <span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span> 's, getting the Iraqis to buy our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">helicopters</span> , and he said, "No." </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">And he said, "What else are you doing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">I said, "Well, to tell you the truth, I'm looking for a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">But I don't know how to go about it." </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">I said, "I figured that with my knowledge of languages and the traveling I've done, there must be something I can do, either in the commerce department as a commercial counselor at an <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> or 1n the State Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">What, how do you go about 1t?". </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">And he said, "Would you consider working for the Defense Department?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">I said, "Defense Department? </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">Doing what?". </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">And he said, "Well, we have a GS15 opening." </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">And I said, "What's a GS15?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">He said, "Oh, that's the equivalent of a full Coronal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">I said, "That still doesn't tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">Money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">How much does it pay?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">He said, "Oh, it's about $14,200." </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">And this is 1963 now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And I said, "Well, that's a little less than what I'm making now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">But I'm at a dead end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">So, yes, I'm interested." </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">So he said, "Well, I'll set up an interview for you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">So the next day I was interviewed by a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">And after an hour of interview he said, 'Welcome aboard." </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">So I went to work for the Defense Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And I stayed there, well until all of my clearances and everything had come through, by the way, I was told, "Welcome aboard," the day before Kennedy was assassinated, and it was on the next day that I was flying back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> when I heard Kennedy was shot and my first thought was oh shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">There goes the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">But no, I was kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">And I, we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , my wife and two daughters in February of 1964.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1169">QUESTION:  Let me ask you a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">This was now almost 20 years .. .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1171">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1172">QUESTION:  ... the past, almost, which 1s less. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">Did you have any way at that time of even knowing what had happened to your parents and where you came from. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1174">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1175">QUESTION:  ... trying to find out all this time...
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">The, through the International Red Cross I had learned back in the, I think it was the late 1940s, that the assumption is that they were transported from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">The German...
QUESTION:  You found that out when you accomplished the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1178">ANSWER:  No, I, yes, I think I was already in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">In the 1950s I applied for, the Germans had a program for restitution. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">And for the restitution program the Germans, or someone had to establish a death date, the date of death for my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">And the German Government arbitrarily declared that they died in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> on May 8th, 1945, which was the last day of the war, the date of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">But I didn't really find out what happened until about three and a half years ago, four years ago, when I was living, when I moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">And we became friends with a French couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">Well, he's French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">His wife is Belgtum. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">And he had been hidden in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> during the war years by a Frenchwoman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">And he had accumulated a lot of information about the war years and what happened to Jews during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">And he showed me a book which the Klarsfelds had put together, which was list of every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> that left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and I went through it and I found my parents' names in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">So I know that they left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> on September 2nd, 1942, and they arrived September 4th at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">And according to the record there of the 1,000 people, I think all but 60-some were immediately gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">So I'm sure that my parents were in one of those that, died on September 4th.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1192">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">It would have been just about a month after you last saw them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1194">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">It would have been a month after, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">So, but that's in the record. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">I mean the Germans are very orderly and they kept detailed lists with every name, place of birth, date of birth and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1198">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">Have you been to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1200">ANSWER:  No, I have not yet been. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">I do want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">And I'd expect I'll be going, probably next year I'd like to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1203">QUESTION:  Do you have children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1204">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">We have two daughters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1206">QUESTION:  And have you told a lot about your experience to them or to other people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1207">ANSWER:  I guess I have told them, and I'm sure my wife has also told them never, I don't think, in a chronological order as we have just done it here during this interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">How much my children have remembered I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">How much they can put together and sort out chronologically I don't know either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">If there is one thing that I've learned, I discovered what is meant by "generation gap." </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">And just as I could not understand what my father was talking about when he was talking to a nine, or a ten, or an eleven-year-old and retelling his exploits on an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Austrian submarine</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> , that when he was in military service and he's Admiral Horthy, what's an Admiral, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">I mean, it didn't mean anything to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">And I would hear the stories time and time again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">And I guess, subconsciously, I was saying to myself, here the old man goes again telling me about his stupid <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarine</span> , okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">So I realized that, you haven't lived it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">It's very, very hard to identify with it, to become involved in it, to get emotionally involved in something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">And the best example I have there is that with all the food shortages and so forth that I've experienced in my life it goes against my grain when I see people leaving food on a plate, which is also why I'm getting fat, because I've got to finish what's on the plate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">And if there is some left in the pot that has to be eaten too because you can't throw it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">And so we used to tell the children, "Eat the food on your plate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">There are people starving in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">There are people hungry in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">There are people hungry here and there." </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">And then one day I realized, how on earth can we expect the children to know what hunger 1s when after every dinner they have a very important decision to make: Do I now eat two scoops of vanilla and one scoop of chocolate ice cream or should it be two scoops of chocolate and one of them vanilla? </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">So it's totally unreasonable to try to expect the other generation to understand this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">Now, perhaps as they get older, our children are now, the oldest one just turned 38 and the younger one is 34. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">They're four years apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">Maybe, as they get older, they might reflect and think back about where their parents were, what they did, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">I did find, last summer, when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> I found the <span class="DLF">grave</span> of my grandmother, my father's mother, and of his father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">And I had it restored. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">So, but that's also something that I wouldn't have given a second thought to 20 years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1231">QUESTION:  Why now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1232">ANSWER:  I guess it's, my days are numbered I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">And if someday our children do want to know where do they, where are their roots, where do they come from, there's something for them to go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">I mean, fortunately, there's nothing for them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1235">QUESTION:  Your grandmother lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1236">ANSWER:  She lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1237">QUESTION:  And your aunt and uncle?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1238">ANSWER:  They also lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">They just lived five blocks apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">And my grandmother, who must have been in her 70s, she had to eke out a living of sorts too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">So she ran a bridge club in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">And everyday people came to play <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">She served tea and cookies and so forth and charged them so much, the setups and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">I had to pay her half of what I was earning for rent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">I lived with her for the first seven, eight months that I was in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> until I went into the Air Force. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">And so I paid her half of what I was earning for <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">And I also had to repay my uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for the fare to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">And I started with nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">But, little by little, especially after I got married, we worked our way up, my wife and I. We first, well, she first started to move into my <span class="INT_SPACE">bachelor apartment</span> which was a one- room studio apartment in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenwich Village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">And I was already living in style at that time because that was expensive real estate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">I mean, and, but it was a furnished place and there was one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">And from there we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newark</span> , closer to where my new business was, the company that I helped set up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">And we lived in a furnished apartment there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">And then we moved into an unfurnished <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> and bought our first stick of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">And then we bought our first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">And little by little, we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">Of course, very often, it was tough, especially tough for my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">Because each time I would uproot her and the kids, if we moved from, we lived outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Princeton</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">I used to commute every day into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">That was a long commute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">But we couldn't afford anything nice nearer <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">So when I then got a job in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> , of course, 1t meant uprooting and moving to <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">When I got a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , first we came down here, lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> in an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">Then we moved closer to the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arlington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">I was putting in very long hours, Saturdays and Sundays. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">And I decided I didn't want to be more than a mile away from the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span> , which was very selfish on my part. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">But the family went ahead and moved again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">And then, subsequently, we did buy a <span class="BUILDING">townhouse</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arlington</span> less than six miles away from the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">And I could shoot down there in 10 minutes time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">So that's, and really, the Washington, D.C. area is the <span class="REGION">area</span> where we lived longer than anywhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">We lived here from 1964 until 1990.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1272">QUESTION:  I think we're coming close to the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">And I would like for you to, I know it's maybe not even a fair question, but 1f you could summarize in some way how your, the first 17 years of life? </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">How you think of it now? </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">How do you, do you still have questions about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">Are you still, do you still analyze it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">Do you still wonder what was happening? </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">Or do you, have you accepted it and moved on beyond it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1279">ANSWER:  I have accepted it and moved on beyond it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">I mean, this goes back to what I told you earlier, that I consider it an act, some people may think it's a curse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">But it's an act that drives my wife up the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">The ability that, for instance, some of these <span class="BUILDING">companies</span> I've worked for, the company stood on the verge of bankruptcy, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">I would leave the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on Friday, 5:30 p.m., and I would kind of switch up there in the brain and it was out of my mind and I wouldn't think about it again until the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">Not while I was driving to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">When I entered the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , then the switch was turned on again and then I started to worry about the problem, what to do next.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1286">QUESTION:  And that's what you've done with the first . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1287">ANSWER:  And that's what I've been able to do, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">I just, unpleasant things, I just shun them aside and that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">It may be good, it may be bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">I haven't discussed it with a psychiatrist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">Every so often my wife says maybe I should go into analysis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">Then I say to her, "Well, if I do, and supposing I discover that I can't live with myself, what do I do then? </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">I'm quite happy now."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1295">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">Here's some stuff that came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">Now what I'd like...
ANSWER:  We're looking at a postcard that was taken probably in the late 1930s of a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which is marked Pension De Famille. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">It was a <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">bed and breakfast</span> , if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">And that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a solid <span class="BUILDING">house</span> built of rocks, the <span class="BUILDING">Les Grillons</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where I lived from the time that I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> in the beginning of 1943, until I left in late 1943, it was called <span class="BUILDING">Les Grillons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">And Daniel Trocme' was the den father, I guess you would call it, who looked after us in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">I've visited that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , by the way, recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">And not much has changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">It looks pretty much the same as it was, including the <span class="DLF">water trough</span> that you see to the far right of the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">Here is a group shot taken in front of Les Grillons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">You can see the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">This is a picture probably of all the kids who were housed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">You can see that there are some very young ones in the front row. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">One of them was the daughter of the cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">And one of them, the little blonde girl in the front with the bow in her hair, she was a sister of the Czech boy who was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">In the picture also, in the back row, in the center, the man with the eye glasses, that is Daniel Trocme'. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">And to the left of Daniel Trocme'’, or to his right, you see another adult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">And that is pastor Theis, who was the assistant Pastor at the <span class="BUILDING">Protestant Church</span> in the Le Chambon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">I am just barely visible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">My face is obscured by the shadows, the shadow cast by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">I'm just to the right of the person on the, the last person on the left there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">You can just barely make out my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">Here is a page from my first diary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">This 1s a diary I'd begun the day I learned my parents had been arrested in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auch</span> , August, 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">The page that you're looking at on the right, it says, in German, Neu Johr, New Year, 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">Since I lived in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , throughout my diary, there are notations in German, which I thought was a language that the French wouldn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">So if I wanted to say something that I didn't want the French to know I would write it down in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">The two photographs are of my mother and my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">They are passport photographs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">I remember where they were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">They were with an amateur camera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">We couldn't afford to go to a photographer at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">And it was taken in our <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auch</span> , where my father kept his rabbits and chickens and a <span class="DLF">vegetable garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">And they just sat in front of the, that <span class="DLF">wall</span> .
