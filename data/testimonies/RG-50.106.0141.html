<p>ANSWER: None</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And where were you born, and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Celle</span> , which is the German pronunciation, spelled c-e- double I-e, near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> in <span class="REGION">northern Germany</span> , on May 16", 1924.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Now let’s talk a little bit about your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">How far back can you trace the generations in this area of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  Well, that’s a very interesting question and I will illustrate it by, well, telling you what happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I—I went to a German school, as a matter of fact I was the only — during Hitler time already, from 1934 to 1938 to Kristallnacht, I was the only Jewish student in a Ss —s — student body of about 280 in a high school that was a [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> , as a matter of fact I was the only — during Hitler time already, from 1934 to 1938 to Kristallnacht, I was the only Jewish student in a Ss —s — student body of about 280 in a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> that was a [indecipherable] gymnasium. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">One of the assignments we had — now thas — this was about 1936, and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> of course was very, a-as we would say, a — a roots — you know, tracing your roots. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">They were interested in genealogy. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">So one of our assignments in social studies was March 16, 2001 to trace our ancestry. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">How was I gonna trace my ancestry? </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My — I — ma — my mother contacted her sister, a maiden sister who lived with my — in my mother’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home village</span> , and contacted my father’s maiden sister, who lived in my father’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home village</span> , and they both yeah, tried to do — trace our history. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And Martha, which was the Roberg side of the family, got as far as great-grandfather, didn’t get very far. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And Aunt Babette(ph) of the Marx family, my mother’s family near — in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Byetahl(ph</span> ) near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> was much more successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">She first traced the history back to 1871, which was written up in the local — what do we call it in German? </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Standes amt, the local village registry. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Prior to that, all births and deaths were, even of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> were inter — entered in the church registry of the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">So she went to the priest and he, as a favor, for 10 mark or so, wrote out our whole genealogy and we were able to trace the f — Marx family back to 1741. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So I drew up a family tree based on this information. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">This took about oh, a couple of months to get that all written out by hand, turning the pages in the book and it became a matter of fascination for the priest himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And I drew a—a family tree, and I turned it in and it turned out that Roberg, the only Jew in the class, could trace his ancestry in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> back further than my 29 Christian stu — fellow students. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And my teacher, who was very s-supportive, and nya — he was not a Nazi by any means, he made a point of it, to — yeah, tell the class that Roberg could trace his ancestry back further than any of the German boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So it’s a longwinded answer to your very brief question. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">March 16, 2001</p>
<p>QUESTION:  But a very interesting answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Tell me your father’s name and his occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  My father’s name was Victor and he was a merchant, a m — well, by — by trade in dry goods, soft goods. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">We owned a little <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , he had learned a trade at age 14, he served an apprenticeship, he learned a business and then he was a — a journeyman, a salesman and then a traveling salesman for a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish firm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">There — he was — Jews at that time were employed by other Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">It was unusual, I guess, to be employed by a <span class="BUILDING">Gentile firm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And</p>
<p>QUESTION:  What was the name of the firm he worked for?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Celle</span> , it was Gebriider Freidberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">That’s Freidberg Brothers, f-r-e-i-d-b-e-r-g, Freidberg Brothers and they owned a department store in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Celle</span> <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> in Celle and he came there, I guess, about 1904 or thereabouts, and he worked there through the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My father was very nearsighted and was unfit for military duty, so — and — and right after World War I, he went into his own business across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from Freidberg’s, set up a cint — competition, and ma — then the inflation came, and he strubbled — struggled, he wasn’t a particularly successful businessman, but — and it was a — it was a struggle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Did your mother work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Yes, my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">My parents got married in 1921 and my mother, of course, came into the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">She had some sort of a dowry, which in those days was expected. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I think it was a marriage that was arranged. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I’m not sure, but I think it was through the newspaper, which was the customary way, rather than shotgun. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And so that was the then modern March 16, 2001 way. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">There was the — a newspaper, Jewish paper called Jiidische Familienblatt, the Jewish Family paper, and there were marriage proposals or whatever and as we have today in some of the better United States papers, started from “The Village Voice” on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  What was her name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  My mother’s name was Selma, but she was called Frieda. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">That’s another story, but I won’t go into that now, and her maiden name was Marx, m-a-r-x.</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did you have any siblings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  Yes, I have a — an older brother, Harry. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">He was Hans, Hans Werner, and I was called Walter. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And he was called Hans and I was called Kurt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  And ha — what’s the difference in age?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  He’s two and a half years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">He was then, and still is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  Did you have a large extended family in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  On my mother’s side there was a large family. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">She was one of six surviving siblings, but none in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">They lived all over me — <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but they were all in close — in close touch with each other, there were weekly letters to everybody, and — including Grandma in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Byetahl(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And so it was a very special — my — on my mother’s side was a close knit family. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">On my father’s side less so, he and his — my father and his brother were not on particularly good terms, and the maiden aunt, sister, which he was a March 16, 2001 —a family of three siblings, she lived in her parents’ <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lemforde</span> , I-e-m-f-o-umlaut-r-d-e near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Osnabriick</span> in <span class="REGION">northern Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  How many Jewish families tell a — out of a total population?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  Ah, it’s a good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">We were a small Jewish congregation, but rather distinct. </span><span class="sentence" id="61"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Celle</span> , as you may or may not know, is of historic significance in that it was a m — the seat of a duke, Herzog, the Duke of Brunswick-Ltineburg — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brunswick-Luneburg</span> , and so it was a white collar community. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Celle</span> was built in 1741 and is today the on — the only surviving <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="REGION">northern Germany</span> that was — well, it was vandalized of course, but that survived, it was not burned or destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">It was destroyed from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , but the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> remains. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">It was during my time, had of course gone past its peak, people had started moving away after World War I. Some families moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> , which was 40 kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">25 miles away was the nearest large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , some moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">The remaining active members in the community were about a dozen families. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">There were some Jewish people who were not active, they didn’t attend services. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">They, I guess were Jews by religion only, or th-they — the Germans so nicely put it, Jewish citizens of a Hebrew faith or persuasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And that was by — by choice, they really didn't want to be identified with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> per se, and that was their choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Give you an illustration, for — we only had services in our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> three times March 16, 2001 a year, on the high holidays, rush — you know, Passover and Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Well, Simchas Torah was observed, and you know, but we had trouble getting a minyan together, of course, and we were, by German standards Conservative, not Orthodox, but the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> of course was built, like m-m-most German synagogues with the women in — in the upper, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> <span class="BUILDING">German synagogues</span> with the women in — in the upper, on the balcony, whatever you call it, and the men downstairs and only men counted for — yeah, for minyan. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">However, if you were 12 years old and you were gonna be Bar Mitzvahed the following year, you could already be counted as a minyan man. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So it was that kind of a thing, or if things got very tough and we were nine, as a last resort they would say — we would send one of the boys, sometimes me, over to one of the non-observing Jews, one of them was Solomon — Solomon and say — ask Solomon if <span class="NPIP">hell</span> come to minyan, you know, and then reluctantly and grumpily would come and di — um, sit in for minyan.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  How many Jewish families were there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="75">How many Jewish families were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  Observing or otherwise, maybe 12 or 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I really haven’t counted them, I can — but I have — I have the records at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I mean, I can make that available if you’re interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  So, your family was observant? </span><span class="sentence" id="79">How would you describe your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  Well, we were traditionally observant. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">My mother came from a observant family, meaning my grandmother kept milchig and fleishig separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">My father came from an Orthodox — well, an observant family. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">My father’s family, it’s a family of butchers, March 16, 2001 kosher butchers, but I guess the scene at the turn of the 20" century was really the — I’m sure I’m not telling you anything new, you know, the German Jewish community had been, well, had the opportunity for the first time to assimil — well, to try and assimilate or at least to practice by choice, and the tendency was away from — from religious observations and to assimilate, to try and assimilate. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So there were many Jews who felt primarily as Germans of Jewish faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And I guess we were — my father ate treyf occasionally, because when he traveled he couldn’t observe all th — so as a — as a boy, as a young man already, he stopped eating kosher as he did at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and my mother the same way when she got out into daily life, modified, and 1t was called new kosher, neu- kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">New kosher meaning you would eat milk and meat mixed but no pork, and —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Did you observe the Sabbath, Shabbat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  We were aware of Shabbat, but we were allowed to ride our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , while on Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, we were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So Shabbat was — it was a work day for us, we couldn’t afford to keep the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> closed and I guess that sort of set the pattern.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  Were your parents Zionists?\</p>
<p>ANSWER:  We were sympathetic — well, Zionism for us started in 1933 or ’34. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">We — the community, our congregation was too small to have a rabbi, but we did have a cantor who was a retired schoolteacher and had a pension and he was the cantor and also our, well, Hebrew teacher and he would officiate at all services, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And that was — but you know, we — we didn’t — we didn’t have a — a rabbi, per se. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">March 16, 2001</p>
<p>QUESTION:  What language did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  German, what else? </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I mean, well, again, as you probably know, German Jews tried to ma — be very low key, be as un-Jewish in appearance, not that we were ashamed or — you know, of being Jews, we were conscious Jews, but we were Jews in religious observance, not, you know, it was not an ethnic group other than by designation by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I mean, we were — we were aware of being Jews, and we wanted to be Jews, but I guess we had no choice anyway, so —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did you feel very German as a young child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  N-No, that’s a tough — I wa — we never really thought about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">We knew we — we — we knew we were nem — you know, German, we knew we were Jews, and of course, well, consciously, wh-when Hitler came to power, it was in 1933, I was nine years old, I remember distinctly when I came to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in 1930. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Before that I went a year to <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> , I was four years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And we were taught from small child on not to make any, as it was known as rishiss(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Are you familiar with the — with the term rishiss(ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  No, could you explain it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Rishass(ph) I think is a Hebrew word. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">It — it is to draw attention to — yeah, don’t make wave, don’t make rishiss(ph) means don’t — you know, don’t draw attention to your Jewishness. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">If — so if you did anything that would be disturbing to the Christian community, if you flaunted your Jewishness, you would say that makes rishiss(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="108">March 16, 2001 Rishass(ph) is, I think — I don’t know what it is in Hebrew, but I — anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So we were — we were taught not to make waves, to conform, not to draw attention to ourselves by being obnoxious or obviously Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Do the things that were ascribed by the Gentile community as being typically Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  Such as?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Be loud, be boisterous and you know, I mean, if you would see somebody with — with — with — with — with payos, obviously they’re — and that — that was a Jewish trait. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Or to walk straight, to be — Jews were thought of as being non-athletic. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">My mother was very proud that we excelled in sports, my brother and I, and it was part of our — well, that we belonged, we were as good as they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And well, it was odd that even my brother and I, during you know, Hitler times in high school, were allowed to participate in sporting events which in many other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , were allowed to participate in sporting events which in many other cities, Jews were no longer allowed to participate. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And I remember Harry, my brother, Hans got a gold oak leaf and — with some event we — we had — from — from our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we had the sports event and I got a bronze even — oak leaf. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Now, I must also tell you that on crystal — the night — yeah, Crystal Night, or the day — the morning after Crystal Night, when we found out, you know, what had happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was not searched or destroyed or what, but we expected that maybe the Gestapo or city police would come and search the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And we got rid of — my mother got rid of anything that would be intimidating, like foreign currency wi — my mother had a few British pounds, Palestinian pounds th — that her sister had brought back March 16, 2001 from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in 1934, and the oak leaves that Harry and I had earned, because if they would come in and say — see that we had oak leaves, maybe the feeling was, what are you trying to prove, you Jew bastards? </span><span class="sentence" id="119">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So she got rid of it, not to antagonize the police should they come, and should they find this and question it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  So you were athletic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  Did you enjoy the athletics? </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Is it something you enjoyed doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Of course I did, to this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  What sports did you take part in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  Well, I — swimming, but I was best in gymnastics, you know, which was the high bar, parallel bars, rings, that sort of thing, and I always got an A. I got an A in the fall, and — and a B plus in the summer because we are — <span class="DLF">field</span> and track, I didn't care for that too much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  How would you describe yourself? </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Were you a very independent young child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I wasn’t in — I mean, I was lucky that I had a playmate, my brother Harry and I, we had German friends in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , a group, really sort of next door neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But after 1933 — well, ’34, they started pulling back and also we did not want them to be embarrassed by associating with us because it — you know, some — a third party might — might say the — you know, there was one, his name was Willie Wrobleski(ph), I f— and they were very poor working family. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">The father was unemployed during the depression, I March 16, 2001 remember, but they were really decent people and we played with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">We had a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> in the back where they had like a little <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> in the back where the boys [indecipherable] there were four of us that really sort of stuck together. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">But then my mother thought that maybe they would feel uncomfortable associating — having their kid associate with us, so we eased back and —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  What did that mean to you as a young child? </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Were you aware of the ramifications of that, of what it meant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  Oh yes, of course we were aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">We were aware of the sensitivities, you know, of other people, of — now, I must say that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Celle</span> was considered, not only by us who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Celle</span> , but ba — of course we were aware of what happened in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> where kids were beaten up on the way to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and — and all that —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  How — how were you aware of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  You heard, you know, you — you — y-you heard from other Jewish families o — in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hessen</span> , in he — yeah, where — where a lot of Jewish families lived in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and where there was a lot of anti-Semitism, either for business reason or just to go and beat up a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Were — the kids were intimidated on the way to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they were called Jew — Jew bastard, Jude itsich(ph), you know —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  What does that mean to an eight year old or nine year old Jewish child?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="227">QUESTION:  And when were you aware of Hitler himself for the first time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">ANSWER:  Oh, before — before 1933 already. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I mean, I was seven, eight years old, I knew Hitler was in the limelight and I remember very distinctly the — about the putsch, the March 16, 2001 Reichstagsbrand, the torching of the Reichstag right after he was elected and acor — of — of course the power grab on January 30", 1933, everybody was aware of that.</span></p>

<p>ANSWER:  [indecipherable] No, I didn’t, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">The - November 10" was my last day in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">After that there was no — no more <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for me or anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">I mean, it was a miracle that I went to a non-Jewish school. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">See, the law by then had already changed, that wherever there were Jewish schools, that the Jews were no longer allowed to go to Christian schools, but there was nothing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Celle</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> , that the Jews were no longer allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">Christian schools</span> , but there was nothing in Celle and I was the only Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Now the Wolf children, Herbert was already — he was goi — he was, I think in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> or somewhere, they had put him into a Jewish school in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> in Hamburg. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">So their children were already out of their <span class="BUILDING">local schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I was really the only Jew in the German school system there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">QUESTION:  You were talking about six weeks to get to be able to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">ANSWER:  No, my father — my father — this is, I think, significant. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">On December 17", my father came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">We didn't know, we had no word that I know of, until he walked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I don’t know, I don’t remember whether he phoned or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I doubt it. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">We weren’t a telephone oriented and we couldn’t trust the telephone. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">My father was released on December 16" from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienburg</span> together with Hans Solomon, who was this — the younger man, the family that we were friendly with. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Of course, all the German — th-the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Celle</span> were sent to the same camp, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienburg</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> Oranienburg. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And I think <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lotheim</span> had already been released a week earlier, but I couldn’t be sure, because he was — he was in his 70’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Hans and my father came out, as I say, on the 16". </span><span class="sentence" id="628">They were just discharged and Hans was a — in his early 30’s then, he was very inventive, he’s a sharp guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And my father, you know, was nearly blind, so they took the old — the hat that — that they were March 16, 2001 getting in — giving — all their clothes had been disinfected and just rolled in a ball, they were crumpled and smelled from this disinfectant, I can smell it today. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And they — he went to the railroad station and took his hat and went begging, you know, with a blind man, you know, here’s a blind man, please give the blind — and they got enough money together from Germans to go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienburg</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and Hans’s sister-in-law lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and took his hat and went begging, you know, with a blind man, you know, here’s a blind man, please give the blind — and they got enough money together from Germans to go from Oranienburg to Berlin, and Hans’s sister-in-law lived in Berlin. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">They went to the sister-in-law, her husband had of course also been taken but she was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and he bought enough money for the railroad fair for the two of them to come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Celle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And then they walked in and I remember my father coming in, his — well, he didn’t have much hair, but the head was completely shaved and this horrible smell of the disinfectant. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And his body smelled from — you know, the only food that they got was — apparently the Germans took whale blubber and cooked that into a stew and that’s what they got to eat, that and some potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And most people couldn’t eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Hans ate it, and whoever didn’t want to, couldn’t stomach this stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">It smelled fa — and my father e-exuded this smell of whale blubber oil type. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I mean, incred — I —I—I can smell it just thinking about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And Hans was the only guy in the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienburg camp</span> who gained weight, because he ate everybody el — what everybody else could — he was that kind of a guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And then my father sat down and he cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I had never seen my father cry, and he related the tortures that they had gone through. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">They had to stand at attention, now this was December, to stand at attention for six hours and if somebody dropped they weren’t allowed to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And just, you know, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , that was March 16, 2001 where they slept over there, wer — where they — and how they were well, humiliated and somebody broke an infraction, everybody — everybody out to witness how they were put aufbuch(ph) that was — it was a— a wooden whatever, gadget, where they were strung up, I

wiesen(ph) is what the Germans — what you consider either cash or anything that is of international value that can be translated into money afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And of course, jewelry was already — I think there was also in August ’38 that Jews had to turn 1n all their gold, they weren’t allowed to have any jewelry other than their wedding rings. </span><span

<p>ANSWER:  Well, I really don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Tearful, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And my parents took me to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I don’t even remember if my father went along, because he wasn’t good for anything, he was just [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I — I think only my mother went with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">I think I said goodbye to my father at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my mother took me to the train station, and I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> and at the <span class="DLF">border</span> <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , and I got on the train to Rotterdam and at the border, the, you know, came, pass(ph) kontrolle, you know, koffer auf machen. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And I said ma — it had the — the suitcase has already been inspected and sealed. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">They looked at the seal, okay, can put it back up, and that was it, and inside I was laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And — well, then as I rolled through the Dutch countryside, it looked awfully good, seeing the cows and you know, the — came — arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> <span class="REGION">Dutch countryside</span> , it looked awfully good, seeing the cows and you know, the — came — arrived in Rotterdam. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Of course, my uncle met me at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and it was a whole new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">So now I was safe in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and my mother, in the meantime — now, my father had been released from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="704">He had to sign a waiver that — yeah, he had to sign a paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">Germans were great at that, I’m sure you know that, that he was not mistreated in any way and that he would leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> within 90 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">At that point, of course, they only wanted to get rid of the Germans — oh, of the Jews, and you could even at that point still take your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> with you, anything that was personal belongings, so my — my mother had to do everything, she did everything, arranged for a — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> , which was the other <span class="DLF">port</span> , besides <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , to have a — well, today we would call it a container, was a liftbahn(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="707">There was a huge box, <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> size was built and your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> were put into it and everything was packed, so she prepared for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And by March, March 15" they March 16, 2001 had to leave because my father’s 90 days were up, and my uncle managed to get them into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holland</span> because we had the American visa applications, he could prove to the Dutch government that we were only in transit and that he would — he had to guarantee of course, that he — he would vou — that we wouldn’t be a financial burden to the Dutch government. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">The Dutch did a lot, more than most, but — they took children, but a-adults? </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Nobody wanted the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">So in — you know, in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transit</span> we could stay then, and we — my parents rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to live in and we ate at my uncles, and it was a— I went to s — of course started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , went to a <span class="BUILDING">trade school</span> and learned a trade and on — then the American visa came up and my parents ni — the decision, the family decision was to take — we had three numbers that my mother had gotten for my father, my mother and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Harry was already in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="713">But the decision was made, since he was the older one, he had already completed <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , he was already, you know, an apprentice at a electri — electrician’s job, to take him along to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> because my father was unfit to work, he was emotionally, physically broken, he really never regained his health. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">The <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> was very kind and looked the other way and — and I mean, they could be tough too, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">As a matter of fact, the — when they were called — we were called to the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> for the examination, had to be a physical examination interview before you got your American visa stamped into your passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And we went already a couple of weeks before and we listened in the — in the <span class="INT_SPACE">anteroom</span> as people were reading the eye chart. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">First <span class="DLF">line</span> , A, E, F, G, K. Line two, etcetera, and we wrote it down March 16, 2001 and my father memorized it. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And came time for him to examine, sat there and he started reciting it. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I’m sure, yeah, the examiner looked at his glasses, he must have known, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Now, read this <span class="DLF">line</span> again, my father — yeah, and he would point at the bottom line, and you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Anyway, he passed and they left with my brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">QUESTION:  Wa — why didn't your mother get four visas? </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Why did she just get three?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">ANSWER:  Because she was thinking Harry is safe in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="725">That’s why. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">But we could have — the American consul in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> said to my mother, why don’t you take your s — take Kurt with you also? </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Said well, we want him to finish <span class="BUILDING">school</span> here, and Uncle Wilhelm, who was in an international business, he was 1n contact with people all over the world, he was a grain merchant and he was convinced that <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> would remain neutral. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I mean, don’t forget, in the meantime the war had started, the Sitzkrieg as it was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I don’t know, you familiar with that term? </span><span class="sentence" id="730">The sitting war, where French and Germans were staring at each other across their fortification, the <span class="DLF">Maginot line</span> and the <span class="DLF">Siegfried line</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="731">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">ANSWER:  And, I mean, the war had started in August ’39.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">ANSWER:  And so we were aware of what was going on, you know, but my uncle was convinced that — that <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> would remain neutral, that the Germans would need <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> as a <span class="DLF">window</span> to the world, just as they did during World War I and so he convinced my March 16, 2001 mother to let me stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and finish <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And it made business sense, you come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I was still of school age, my father couldn’t work, who is gonna support us, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">QUESTION:  What were your thoughts about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">ANSWER:  Didn’t matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">My thought — I mean, whatever the — whatever the decision was, children weren’t asked in those days and I was — I was happy to stay with my uncle and finish <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and all. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I thought it was best for me to finish <span class="BUILDING">school</span> rather than starting to — you know, and I studied English, I was learning English, and to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> as prepared as I could be rather than coming in there having no trade, not knowing your language, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">So it was — was a rational decision and we were — we were convinced that <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> would stay neutral. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">So anyway — so there was the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">So they left on April 5“, 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">While they were at <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , on April 10,1940, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> and overran <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , and my mother was in panic. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">End of Tape Two, Side B March 16, 2001 Beginning Tape Three, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Kurt Roberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">This is tape number three, side A. And your parents and brother are on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="746">ANSWER:  Yes, it is April 5", 1940, they — my parents have — and Harry have left for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and I guess it’s April 10" now and they have found out about the invasion of — by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and my mother is panicked and up in arms and of course she wrote a letter on board which was posted in New York, air mail, via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> to americ — to — to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and reached us, I guess, just before the invasion of the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , air mail, via Lisbon to americ — to — to Holland and reached us, I guess, just before the invasion of the Netherlands by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And of course on May 10", 1940, six o’clock in the morning, we woke up and I heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , and having lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Celle</span> , where we had two <span class="BUILDING">air bases</span> nearby, I knew by sound all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> , and I woke up and I heard and I said to my uncle, Uncle Wilhelm, I said, those sound like Ju-52. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">That’s the Junkers 52 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport plane</span> that was used for parachute jumps. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">He says, you’re crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Ah, I was right, and he wasn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">For once he was not right. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And well, the invasion came. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">The Dutch, who thought that if they inundated the — you know, th-the — the <span class="REGION">land</span> and they could stop the Germans, but the Germans came by parachute. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">They — we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> , they came down and — and the Dutch Marines held the Maas bridges for three days, didn’t surrender them to the Germans, and I as a German citizen, having a German passport, which incidentally was on the — in the — at the American consulate in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> , we — I was — March 16, 2001 the Dutch police came, since I was registered as a German citizen living with my uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> <span class="DLF">Maas bridges</span> for three days, didn’t surrender them to the Germans, and I as a German citizen, having a German passport, which incidentally was on the — in the — at the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> in Rotterdam, we — I was — March 16, 2001 the Dutch police came, since I was registered as a German citizen living with my uncle in Holland. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">The fact that you are Jewish, well, didn’t mean anything to the Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">You were German or you were Dutch or you were whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And politically it didn’t make any difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I mean, the individual policeman could have been sympathetic and knew what a — that the German Jews were not — you know, in — were not sympathetic to the German government, but there were also a lot of other Germans living in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> who might have been, and there was a fifth column in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , wa — a Nazi party run by Mussert. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And the Mussert Nazis in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> were a force and the — so we were interned and my uncle, of course, you can imagine how he felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">He had convinced my mother to let me stay and, you know, go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and I was being interned, and now we didn't know what was gonna happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">So they took us to all the other — I knew some of the German refugees, Jewish refugees in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and we were all taken to a large <span class="BUILDING">meeting hall</span> , which was right next to the <span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span> and we were kept there. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">They brought in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> , they put them down on the big dance floor in the <span class="BUILDING">dance hall</span> and that was our temporary lodgings. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And we were there for four days and then on May 14" at noon — we were kept informed of what was happening, now there was — already there were rumors that the Dutch — the — that the Germans had poisoned the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">This was all — the fifth column spread these rumors to force the Dutch to surrender, and there were all sorts of rumors spreading and anyway, th — by one o’clock the Germans start — 1:30 the Germans started bombing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> had been declared an March 16, 2001 open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> as of noon on Tuesday because the Dutch were ready to surrender and they didn’t want the t-town — it’s not a military target to — to be bombed, but the Germans bombed it anyway, claiming that the order came too late and they couldn’t stop the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">t-town</span> — it’s not a military target to — to be bombed, but the Germans bombed it anyway, claiming that the order came too late and they couldn’t stop the bombers that were on the way, like they had no radio, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And they bombed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> and of course as soon as the bombs started falling and our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was bombed too, the man standing next to me was hit by a shrapnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">I had learned in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> — as part of our preparation for the war, when I was still going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we had air raid drills. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Oh, there was a systematic preparation of the German population for war. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">That if there’s an air raid and you’re in a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , stand in a <span class="DLF">doorway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="770">That’s what I did, and that’s what saved me. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">So —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So you were in this big <span class="BUILDING">dance hall</span> when this bombing started?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="772">ANSWER:  We were — yes, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">But of course the Dutch guards who were assigned to guard us, they said look, you know, we’re being bombed, run, save yourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">They let us go. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">They knew it was over, and you know, there was no sense in keeping us. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">So I ran <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">QUESTION:  Were you with your uncle at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">ANSWER:  No, no, my uncle — I was — I was the — he was a Dutch citizen, he wasn’t touched. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">I as a 15 year old was interned by the Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">He was a Dutch citizen, he wasn’t touched. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">So he didn't know what happened to me and he tried to find out and they said well, we are safe and we are being well fed, which we were, and — but we were retained. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And they March 16, 2001 couldn’t put us in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , they didn’t have enough <span class="INT_SPACE">jail space</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="783">So they interned us 1n this <span class="BUILDING">dance hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">So I ran <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did you have any communication with him while you were in — interned?</span></p>

<p>ANSWER:  I managed, I managed, there’s — there wasn’t — there wasn’t a problem, I — I was self sufficient. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">You — when you grew up in Nazi Germany, at age 14 I was self sufficient, certainly at age 15, yeah, just was a year later. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">So I had no — I had no problems with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">I—I could fend for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">And I ran <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I went into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I had the keys. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And my uncle’s <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> wasn’t there and a couple of his personal things were gone, so I knew that he had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I took my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , took a few things into my rucksack and took my stamp collection that I had saved once, put them the back on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> and took off with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> and out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Now, we only had — we had relatives who lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hillerhausberg(ph</span> ), and I decided to go there, but to go there I had to well, go through a railroad — go through a railroad underpass and of course the <span class="DLF">road</span> was jammed with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , but I was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , there were a few other people on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> is a — <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> is a means of transportation and there weren’t that many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> <span class="DLF">railroad underpass</span> and of course the road was jammed with cars, but I was on a bicycle, there were a few other people on bicycles, you know, Holland is a — bicycle is a means of transportation and there weren’t that many cars in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">But I got through this traffic jam with my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> faster than the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and I went to March 16, 2001 Hillerhausberg(ph) and when I got there I saw my uncle’s <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> standing in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that I was visiting, of course he was very happy to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">He didn’t know what had hap — what would happen to me, whether I was alive, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And so we had a happy reunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Then that night and then the following night we saw <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> burn. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">The Germans had thrown a lot of incendiary bombs and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> went up in smoke, the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And then eventually, after I guess about four or five days after the fires were out we returned back to our address on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauritsweg</span> , and we found that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was well, burned, the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was the second <span class="BUILDING">house</span> left standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Next to us — these are very much like the brownstones in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="805">They are one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> wide and foos — three stories high, but they’re with a stoop. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Our neighbor’s next to us was standing and that was the m — consul of <span class="COUNTRY">Monaco</span> lived there and the flag was still flying. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And I came into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , nothing was touched. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">There was no pilfering, there was no looting, not a <span class="DLF">window</span> was broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">It was, yeah, really everything was untouched. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Well, we moved back in, but now the — the Germans of course came — came in that very afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">I saw Germans everywhere and we really felt we were — well, we were occupied.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="813">QUESTION:  What was it like for you to see the Germans again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="814">ANSWER:  Terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">It was really, I mean like — like a 10 ton weight was put on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Before I had felt free, that freedom I felt when I left the <span class="DLF">German border</span> behind me, this, you know, breathing free, and no — now I don’t have to watch any more what I am saying, I don’t March 16, 2001 have to be on my guard constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">You don’t have to look over your shoulder or try and anticipate what the people around you do, how they act and react and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">All that was gone, and — but at least I knew what to expect and what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Now the Germans, at that point they came in and they really tried to befriend, or have the Dutch befriend them. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">They were — they did not act as occupiers or so, at least their, well, PR relations, as we would say today, they — they really tried to win the Dutch over to them by, you know, propaganda articles, radio broadcasts. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Of course everything was taken over, we are not here, we — we — this was a tactical move, we had to do that to prevent the British from invading you. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And we are, you know, you — or you are Aryan just as we are, and try to, you know, take that tack to win the Dutch over. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">But in the meantime, of course, the Dutch knew what the Germans were like, most Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And that were there to grab the food and they were exba — sending all the produce — <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was known for cream and cheese and butter and all the, you know, good things in life that — that was being sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and of course that was the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">So —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Speaking about Aryan, did you — was your coloring very dark? </span><span class="sentence" id="826">What did you look like, physically?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="827">ANSWER:  My — no, I — as — as they used to say in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I could pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I didn’t look Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">There’s a little anecdote I can tell you that happened in 1936 while I was still in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and Harry, my brother was still in class. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">Of course the edict had come down, the instructions that race theory had to be taught in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And that — our biology teacher March 16, 2001 ha — also happened to be my brother’s homeroom teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">So one day 1-1n class, says well, today we will talk about the Aryan race. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">We know of course that the characteristics of the Aryan race are a long — you know, oval face, high forehead, blue eyes, straight nose, blon — blonde hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And he looked around the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> and he said, like Roberg, for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And he did that very deliberately, to make a point. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I don’t know on — how many got the point that he made in the class, but he did it because he felt good about tt. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">It turned out — I found out after — I visited this teacher, Dr. Riegerberg(ph) after the war when I came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and I visited with him, and I found out then that he had a Jewish grandmother that some of his colleagues knew about, but nobody would tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And they protected him until 1944 when the director of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> thought it was best if he would take early retirement, just to protect him. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">So those were the games people played, okay, and that was — so you asked me whether I looked Jewish, that’s my answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="840">QUESTION:  Okay, we’re back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="841">ANSWER:  We’re back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="842">My uncle sold his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="843">I taught him how to ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , he hadn’t ridden a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> since he was a boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And we — well, we pared down. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">His business, of course, was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">He was a well-to-do man, but you know, there was no more international grain trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And my — I had no papers at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">My passport had been at the American consulate, which went up in flames with the rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> , which went up in flames with the rest of the city. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">So first I had to get anew German passport, and that took about three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">By —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Were you ever in fear for your life during any of this time? </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Direct fear of your life? </span><span class="sentence" id="852">March 16, 2001</p>
<p>ANSWER:  From the Germans, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">During the bombing, mm, I ran pretty fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">But not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">I can’t say that I was ever afraid because — I think because I was prepared, I was — you know, as a child I think the air raid drills, that’s something to — really that has served me well throughout my life is I believe in preparation because I learned nearly in life that preparation and knowing what your alternatives are, making several choices, having a plan A, B and C is good planning and gets you set, you know, for various eventualities. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">So maybe I can, you know, look at that as a positive thing that came out of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">Anyway, by about July, August, the Germans were, of course, pre-preparing for the invasion of Great Britain. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And whatever was afloat, they requisitioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">They were requisitioning every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barge</span> , every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , every whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">But is also showed to us and the Dutch that they really hadn’t prepared — I think the war went so well for them, both in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , you know, they wiped out the allies and came to — to the North Sea and the <span class="DLF">channel</span> , and really weren't prepared to invade — to invade <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> and the channel, and really weren't prepared to invade — to invade England when the time was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Had they prepared a — an invasion fleet to follow up on the ground victory, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> would have been mincemeat. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">So then they — the — well, the Battle of <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> and the air war started and we followed that, of course, from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and we would listen to BBC. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">The mul — the Dutch channel, the Orange channel broadcast every night at nine o’clock and all Dutch would listen to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And of course you risked whatever, your freedom, your life, if the Germans found out that you listened to — to — March 16, 2001 and they could arrest you, arrest you, but you took the chance and you did it discreetly, and —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Were you permitted to have a radio?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="865">ANSWER:  At that point in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , yes, they couldn't control it. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , of course, Jews weren’t allowed to have radios any more since 1936, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">But yes, you were allowed to have radio because the — also they, at that point still wanted to look like the good Germans so they didn’t come out with the edicts of no radios, or no this or that. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Of course, it was known that — that you weren't allowed to listen to the enemy, but who cared?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="869">QUESTION:  To — to back up a little bit, do you remember your 16" birthday in May 1940?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="870">ANSWER:  That’s a good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I remember my 16" birthday, yes, and we celebrated it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hillerhausberg(ph</span> ) and my uncle was — and I was exceedingly glad to be able to celebrate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I don’t know how we celebrated it, but I guess we found a little cake. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">You know, the Dutch are very good at finding sweets somewhere, so I’m sure that we did it the right way. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">I don’t remember the details, but yes, yeah, it’s — it’s interesting for you to note that it was right there in the thick of it, while <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">By about August then, when the invasion plans of the Germans became more prominent, all German born Jews were ordered to leave the coastal zone of, I think 25 kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">So I had to move from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> and an aunt and uncle of mine, who were the parents of a cousin, ma — that’s my uncle’s older sister and her husband, they had also come to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> because March 16, 2001 her daughter lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And we then had to move out of the Rotterdam area, further inland and we went to How-da, which to Americans in pronounced <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gouda</span> <span class="REGION">Rotterdam area</span> , further inland and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">How-</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">How-da</span> , which to Americans in pronounced Gouda, where the cheese comes from. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">And I con — we rented a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> and Aunt Lena kept <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for her husband and me and I went to trade school. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">I resigned from the Rotterdam trade school that I went to and went to the trade school, continued in trade school in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gouda</span> <span class="BUILDING">trade school</span> , continued in <span class="BUILDING">trade school</span> <span class="BUILDING">Rotterdam trade school</span> that I went to and went to the trade school, continued in trade school in Gouda.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="880">QUESTION:  Stu — studying what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="881">ANSWER:  Oh, I was studying auto mechanics. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">But in order to become an auto mechanic the first year we had to work on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , the second year on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> and the third year on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="883">So I was up to working on an old Nash engine. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And while we were there, my uncle, in the meantime or — yeah, I — I had to get a new passport which eventually I — I got from the Germans, of course, you know, with the new photo and a big J stamped into it again, J for Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="885">QUESTION:  Was the name <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="886">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Kurt — Kurt Walter Israel. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">I still have the passport, so I can check that. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And well, went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and we heard from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="890">Of course, <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> heard from us via <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I still have the card, the first card that we sent to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , a postcard. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">You were only allowed to send postcards, no letters, because it was easier for the Germans to censor them. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">Read a postcard easier than opening up a letter and closing it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">Where we — March 16, 2001</p>
<p>QUESTION:  What — what kind of things did you say on the postcard?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="895">ANSWER:  Very interesting that you — I have the postcard. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">We wrote it, of course, in Dutch, even though my parents didn’t understand Dutch, but Harry was there to translate it, and I wouldn’t have written in German for all the tea in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="897">QUESTION:  Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="898">ANSWER:  Because we hated the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">I felt like a — like a Dutch person, I wanted to have nothing to do with — with Germans and I sort of denied that I — you know, that I certainly would not let them know, or give them the satisfaction or make it easy for them to read my mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">So this was — this is the only way we could get back. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">But there was that, you know, resentment — well, resentment, you’re gonna make it as tough for them as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="902">QUESTION:  Were you still speaking in German though, to your uncle?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">ANSWER:  No, we spoke Dutch only. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Oh no, we — we — at that point we wouldn’t have spoken German for anything, either in public or even in private. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">With my uncle and aunt, I mean, Aunt Lena of course, I had to speak German because they didn’t understand any Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">But I was fluent in Dutch and of course, you know, in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="907">So — no, but we wouldn't have spoken German for anything, so my corresponding was in — but I wrote everything in — well, we had a—acode. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">This interesting point that you make. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">This is something that we had already developed while living in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="910">When — when we wrote from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , let’s say to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> or to relatives, we would write it in such a way that they understood what we were talking about but nobody else could. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">For instance, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Celle</span> , the March 16, 2001 — the captain of the volunteer fire brigade, his name was Schnell, which happens to be quick, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="912">Schnell. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">So I wrote on this postcard, we are well. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">Our old neighbor Herr Schnell had plenty of work for at least a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">So they knew how to interpret that, the censor didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">So this is how we got the information across without, you know — anyway, it worked for us and I think all families had that. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">Or we would — we would refer to family members who were already somewhere else, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">If — if we had a relative, let’s say, in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , we would say Uncle S-Simon, you know, we were able to get in touch with Uncle Simon and send him something. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">Meaning we were able to send something to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="920">So that’s how we disguised information. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">I think that was pretty common. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">You just had to adapt to conditions, and you did. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">And it became actually, a sport to try to outwit the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">That was our mentality and it was also, that’s what kept us going. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Chronologically now I want to move on to — my uncle, of course, was trying desperately at that point to try and get me to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Don’t forget, <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was still neutral. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Then he found out in oh, about in October, November must have been, sometime in the fall of 1940 that someone in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> tried to organize a children’s transport to save or to reunite children who were left behind in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> with parents who were already in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . [ </span><span class="sentence" id="928">only found out about 10 years ago when I was in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">war museum</span> and archives, who this woman was. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And that was Mrs. Wijsmuller. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">She was — and my uncle found out about it because her husband was a shipping magnate. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">He — he owned <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And my uncle was, you know, dealt with March 16, 2001 steamship companies, being in the grain business. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And Mrs. vice — Mefrau Wijsmuller, they were not Jewish, of course, had very good relations with the Germans, German officers, in particular. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  — volunteer collection interview with Kurt Roberg, this is tape number three, side B. And you were talking about Frau Wijsmuller.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="935">ANSWER:  Mefrau Wijsmuller, spelled w-i-j-s-m-u-l-l-e-r.

<p>ANSWER:  Well, there was one man —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  — have conversation with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="983">ANSWER:  — thi — well, not at large. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">There was a man who was assigned to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">He was — he was the contact, so we didn’t just — you know, he was the contact, and we also in the group, the oldest person — oh, there were two, there was one woman, Judith, she was 17, and there was a fellow with whom I became very friendly, Jerry Cohen(ph) was 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">They were the — the senior people and they sort of, you know, took everybody’s passport so that — there had to be an organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">They were in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">Anyway, the first day, of March 16, 2001 course, within 24 hours, within <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , certainly within Europe, when you move, you know, you have to register. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">When you leave <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , whe-when I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gouda</span> , I had to go to the city hall and say, I’m leaving, I’m going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I will be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> and say, I’m leaving, I’m going to Berlin, I will be in Berlin, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="990">And then when I — when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> we had to say, we are now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , we come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gouda</span> , etcetera, records, you know, transfer every — and everything with stamps and so we had to go to the city police in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and s-state that we were there for one week, we were staying at Grosse Hamburger Strasse and we were going — after one week we would go — you know, continue on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> , we were in transit. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">Fine, got permission to stay for seven days, no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">But after seven days we did not have our transit visas for <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="993">We needed transit visas for — well, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> wasn’t a problem, that was an occupied country. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">It’s — the Germans were in charge, but <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">And our passports were taken to — were taken to the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish consulate</span> and they said oh, we will be glad to give you the visa, as soon as you have the Portuguese visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">What’s the sense of giving you a Spanish, you don’t even have the Portuguese? </span><span class="sentence" id="997">And unless we can be assured that you have the Portuguese so that you don’t get stuck in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , we will give it to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">Went to the Portuguese. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">Of course we will give you Portuguese visa, as soon as you have the Spanish visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">What’s the sense of giving you a Portuguese, you don’t even have the Spanish?

</span><span class="sentence" id="1011">You would never get your exit permit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">So they gave us another one week extension. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">Now within that week we still did not have the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">Now they said well, the — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> is not responsible for these papers, the American visa was issued in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">The — these people came from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , they should have gotten their Portuguese and Spanish transit visas in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">So they took our passports and sent them back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">Now we were without identification. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">We got, I guess, a temporary, you know, bu — I —I.D. card, whatever from the — from the — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">Now we did not dare to, you know, go out or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">If we — if we would be caught without that — you know, you have to — you have to expl — well, we did go out, but only — things were very controlled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> already at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">The British would fly over and bomb occasionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">It was not — but they would come across, so there were air raids at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">The food was rationed, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">And Jews had special ration coupons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">Everything was by coupons and the Jewish coupons were stamped with a red J. Jews were only allowed to buy after four p.m. There was nothing left by four p.m. You go into a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> , you took whatever — if they had anything left you March 16, 2001 took what, you know, didn’t say well, I want a rye bread, you took whatever they had, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">Those were the conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">Anyway, the Jewish congregation — and I’m going to try and find out how they did that, had a — had a gimmick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">They protected us from being assigned to the workforce, and it worked as follows. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">We were assigned as a workforce in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin Wannsee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">Now, I don’t know whether you know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wannsee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1031"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wannsee</span> was there was a large <span class="REGION">estate</span> which was — course had been Jewish, that was confiscated and had been made as a R and R retreat for the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">They were still in the process of fixing that up and the Jewish congregation apparently had somehow managed to arrange that they will supply X number of workers every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">Let’s say 50 workers for doing ground keeping etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">So now we were assigned twice a week to go out and work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wannsee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">The Gestapo out there didn’t care who came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">Now we were — we were briefed, we were told, you will see people in striped suits that are guarded by soldiers with guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">Don’t even look at them, make no eye contact with anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">Don’t talk to anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Don’t talk among each other other than necessary, even the people that you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">Do your work, keep your head down, mind your own business, don’t make waves, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">So, with those instructions we took the S-<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Bahn</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> , the elevated out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wannsee</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">-Bahn</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">S-Bahn</span> , the subway, the elevated out to Wannsee and we went to work, raking, cleaning up, whatever they told us to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">And now we had to go back after two weeks to the city police. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">What are you doing, you have been here — are you — what — we are working for Gestapo Wannsee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">That’s all they had to hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">We got our stamp. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">You can stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">We had the extension. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">And that’s how they rotated people who March 16, 2001 were about to leave to protect them from being entered into the labor force. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">And I’m going to try and find out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> when I am there this spring if they know how they managed to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">In the meantime, political things march on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">Things in the Balkan weren’t going too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">We were watching, of course the political or the — how the war developed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">So far, for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> everything went right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054"><span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> started to invade <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albany</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albany</span> couldn’t be invaded.</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="1301">I didn’t say that, but I— we were taught to be humble, even in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">So, well, we docked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoboken</span> , as was customary in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">American export line docked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoboken</span> , not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> <span class="DLF">American export line</span> docked in Hoboken, not in New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">And of course my mother knew — oh, I had — I had borrowed three dollars from a German speaking steward on board, to send a telegram from aboard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to my mother that I was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">She hadn’t heard from me since I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">I didn’t write because every week we were supposed to leave and I was going to be there before the letters, right?

</span><span class="sentence" id="1309">Anyway, so she was down on the <span class="DLF">pier</span> and I was up on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">board</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">All the passengers were leaving the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> except me and one other woman, we stayed on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">board</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">Do you think they would have let my mother up, or me down? </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">No, not in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">We waved, she cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">I guess I was teary- eyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">And I remember I s — I called to my mother, Mother, are you wearing lipstick? </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">She says, yes, in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> we — in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> we wear lipstick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">Because in Europe women — March 16, 2001 hussies wore lipstick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">My mother wearing lipstick, can you believe that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">I said, before you know it you probably will — will paint your nails red, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">So those were the little — and that — that sort of stuck in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">Now anyway, my mother was told that I could not come down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">We hollered up and down, you know, across the — and they told me that I'd have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> for a hearing, just a formality. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">And my mother, of course, went the next day just for this formality and there was a hearing before a judge, and he looked at my papers and decided that well, they couldn’t let me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">Now they — the visa was definitely expired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">As a matter of fact, there was something wrong with the visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">The visa was issued on January 31°, it should have only gone to May 30". </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">They gave you an extra day, why? </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">Oh, this will have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , the State Department will have to handle that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">And so it happened that Kurt Roberg stayed on Ellis Island for four weeks while they debated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> for four weeks while they debated in Washington whether they could take a risk, the risk of letting me in, or whether they would send me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">And I guess lawyers came cheap in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">American export lines had their lawyers working on it, because they would have had to pay another 210 dollars to take me back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> <span class="DLF">American export lines</span> had their lawyers working on it, because they would have had to pay another 210 dollars to take me back to Lisbon and obviously lawyers were paid a lot less than that in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">So after four weeks they finally re — relented and — and they said, you can stay.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1641">ANSWER:  No, I think it’s been a m — it has been a good — I—I can only see it as a good affect, whether everybody agrees with me, I m— m — some people think that I’m too — well, I’m a — I’m a product of the 1930’s environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1642">I think we have the same thing in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , you know, people are products of the ba — depression era. </span><span class="sentence" id="1643">We are oriented toward practicality, economy, frugality, etcetera, and of course my German background m — of 105March 16, 2001 certainly m-me — German Jewish background, the emphasis in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> is, I think everywhere in Jewish circles was education, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1644">The saying was always, especially if you move around, as the Jews have for hundreds of years, you — what you c — what you carry in your — you don’t carry heavy in what’s 1n your head, however that translates, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1645">And so we were always oriented toward learning and well, I think that is probably the basis of my [indecipherable] and planning ahead, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1646">Planning, having a structured life rather than living out into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">w-wild</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1647">But I think that’s a matter of personality, I don’t know whether that is any background. </span><span class="sentence" id="1648">By the same token my wife, who grew up in <span class="REGION">wartime Germany</span> , and she was five years younger, so she had to leave <span class="REGION">eastern Germany</span> when the Russians came, as a small child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1649">Her father by that time had disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1650">Mother was left with two children, and the stories of, you know, the Russians coming, raping, killing, burning, whatever, they, you know, they took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1651">They left with the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1652">They were able to save themselves, they lost everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1653">And she, since childhood really never wanted to own anything because she didn’t want to go through what her mother had gone, having to leave everything behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1654">So Connie was really very much oriented toward enjoying things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1655">She said, I don’t have to own paintings, P’Il be very happy to see them in a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">I don’t want to own anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">I don’t want to — you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1658">So the different people are affected differently by the same set of circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="1659">And so, if we put the finger on what causes certain developments, or developmental trends, I think you can read a lot into conditions that you want to read into 106March 16, 2001 it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1660">And you know, psychologists are so busy trying to come up with formulas of what happens why. </span><span class="sentence" id="1661">I’m not a great believer in that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1664">QUESTION:  Any other sounds or smells or sights that remind you of those previous years? </span><span class="sentence" id="1665">Any other ones.?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1666">ANSWER:  Well, I think that we associate certain things, pleasant or unpleasant with first time experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">I think that’s a common human thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1668">Whether this is sounds, noises, music we hear under certain circumstances for the first time, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1669">A — a song that we — that we hear for the first time under romantic conditi — it sticks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">So I think that’s just a human phenomena that ham —mi — I mean, they — the smell, yes, it was — 1t was very vivid, but I think that is like the question you asked, do you know where you were on Pearl Harbor day or on the day Kennedy was assassinated, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1671">So the day my father came back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and the smell, and the way he looked is a landmark impression, whether I was a child at the time, or whether it was when Kennedy was assassinated and I was a man, you know, we were — I don’t — I don’t think we should separate that into either childhood or adulthood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1672">I think it happens and it’s lasting, or it isn’t, So —</p>

<p>QUESTION:  Wh-When your children were the age that you were, for instance when herb — Hitler first came into power in the rest of the 1930’s and early 40’s, did that make you think of your childhood, when they were that age that you were at the time, you know, nine, 10 - 11 - 12 - 13, did that remind you of what you were doing at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1707">ANSWER:  Not directly, but I will say that, you know, I’m into sports and I — I played with my children in a very active way, which my father never did with us, but he was older. </span><span class="sentence" id="1708">My father was 38 when he married and plus that he was physically handicapped in a — by his sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1709">And other than that, I— you know, I — when — I think I always knew how a child feels, whether the child is five years old, or eight, or 14, because I’ve been there, and I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1710">I remember what a child’s emotions are, feelings, and I could identify with my children at the various levels, my son more than with my daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1711">I never had a — you know, I never had a sister, so that’s — was a little touchier, but certainly with my son — and — but I never, I n — you know, I never did them, when I was your age, or you know, bit, the —</p>

<p>QUESTION:  — you know, as a — did th — did that — did you think about that, at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1715">I mean, you had to leave one <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , go to the next, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1716">ANSWER:  Well, no, I mean, that was — those were the facts, that was, you know, that doesn’t — I don’t think that it influenced me or affected my — my life or my character or my — scarred me in — in any way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1717">Of course, you know, people of my generation who went through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , who saw unspeakable, you know, brutality, etcetera, that they had to react and that it left scars, is beyond question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1718">I was lucky 1n that the things that, well, I was exposed to were not, by and large, not traumatic enough, or I was able to deal with it because I, at the time, certainly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , all the things we saw, that I knew it was temporary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1719">I have a way out, I have a ticket to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1720">I have a way out, even though that was very questionable, I always felt that I wasn't trapped over there.</span></p>

Because you saw people deprived of their civil rights in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the 30’s, do you think that makes you more sensitive, or did it make you more sensitive to the Civil Rights movement here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1739">ANSWER:  More sensitive —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Cause you actually saw it with your own eyes in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1740">112 March 16, 2001</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, I — well, I-I’m certainly more aware of it, but I’m also aware of the abuses and of the limitations and it’s interesting that I’ve gone back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> many times and the change I see in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> today, the change toward democracy is really remarkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1741">I had a very interesting experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1742">As a matter of fact I [indecipherable] I went back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Celle</span> on the anniversary of Crystal Night in ’98, 50" anniversary and participated in a — well, I really instigated a memorial service at the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Celle</span> , and I went over there for that and I was the keynote speaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="1743">And I'll be glad to send you a copy of that speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="1744">It was held in German, but I made a fairly accurate English translation for my congregation and for my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1745">So Ill send you that, and you can put it into the records. </span><span class="sentence" id="1746">But 1— I really — and I met with some of my former classmates for whom I would vouch that they were not Nazis then or now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1747">And it was a very interesting experience and I think sort of telling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1748">The — yeah, what went on under Hitler, how a lot of Germans who were, let’s say scared into following the party line. </span><span class="sentence" id="1749">Of course there was a meal ticket too, that they didn’t dare to go across the — against the party line because it meant their livelihood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1750">And I think there is really a lot of true democracy, especially in the young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1751">We — we read about the skinheads, the anti-Semitism, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1752">But just like here, the good people don’t make news, it’s the bad people that make the news, and I think in our society too, you hear about the killings of — you know, the teenagers that are shooting up our <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and all that, but you don’t read about the good kids or the kids that are scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1753">I met a little girl in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> , she’s 11 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1754">There was a — well, talk 113March 16, 2001 about a — an incident in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and she was scared and she asked her mother, I don’t want to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> today because there’s gonna be trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1755">You know, there are — so what I’m saying 1s there’s good and bad everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1756">We don’t — we don’t hear about the good kids, we only hear about the bad kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1757">And I think you as a — as an educator, know that that is so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1758">To condemn a whole generation or sector of the population because of a few, is unfair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1759">Any time you generalize, it’s unfair, or even inaccurate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1760">What’s his name, Goldhagen? </span><span class="sentence" id="1761">Every German is guilty? </span><span class="sentence" id="1762">I haven’t read his book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1763">I read the synopsis in the “New York Times” book review and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1764">I don’t want to read his book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1765">He can come with statistics, but I don’t think that every German down — deep down in his heart, felt anti-Semitic or was part — part-participated or wanted to participate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1766">So he has a formula; that formula too, is not accurate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1767">I think you have to take people as individuals and that’s what I try to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1768">They’re good and they’re not so good and they’ re outright bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1769">And n — that has been — I mean, I made my peace with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 19 — in the 1950’s, when I went back the first time on business with Hans Solomon(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1770">We went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to try and do business in 1952. </span><span class="sentence" id="1771">We went to the photo show in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and we spent two weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Celle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1772">Now he, being 15 years older than I, was there as an adult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1773">He remem — knew a lot more people, and we looked up a lot of them and talked to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1774">Of course, in the 50’s, nobody would know or admit that they knew anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1775">But we talked to people who said yes, we knew that Bergen-Belsen, which was 15 miles away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Celle</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , which was 15 miles away from Celle, that 1t was there, but we didn’t know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1776">We — the man who was — 114 March 16, 2001 who supplied meat there, he went in there every couple of weeks, driving a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> in there, sure he saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="1777">But he was told these are foreign Zwangsarbeiter, forced labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1778">But that they were systematically starved to death, or whatever, worked to death, he didn’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1779">Nobody — nobody knew that other than the guards and the guards didn’t tell, because it was self-incriminating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1780">He supplied meats, he supplied food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1781">Hey, we’re taking food in there every week, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1782">Whether — that this was only for the guards or whatever, nobody knew, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1783">So what I am — what I am saying is that we did talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1784">Ther- There was a death march where people were marched from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> 15 miles to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1785">And yes, some of the people saw it and even taunted the prisoners and whatever, you know, on the death — that came out later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1786">Yes, but those people aren’t going to talk about it or advertise it or admit it, even. </span><span class="sentence" id="1787">They are the ones that say, we don’t want to talk about the past any more, we want to lo — but the young Germans, who now — I mean — I mean the new, young generation, whose grandparents were the perpetrators, participants or silent participants, they are now asking, why did you keep quiet? </span><span class="sentence" id="1788">How could you k- keep quiet? </span><span class="sentence" id="1789">They don’t understand how they could have — how their parents and grandparents could have kept quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1790">And it’s very hard in the 1990’s, or 2000, to understand what the mentality was 50 years ago unless, you know the zeitgeist of the era, what the fears were, what the attitudes were and why people kept quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1791">Why people didn’t speak out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1792">They were scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1793">The man I told you about who lived below us, the people who helped us on Crystal Night, he was a high official at the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , the Supreme 115 March 16, <span class="BUILDING">2001 Court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1794">And he had the key for the ar — in — in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and up on — on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> was a flag — you know, f — a —a flagstaff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1795">And when the Nazis took over, they went up there to pull down the red, white and blue flag to hoist the Nazi flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="1796">And who has the key? </span><span class="sentence" id="1797">Rusterfeld(ph) has the key, get Rusterfeld(ph), and they said, we want the key. </span><span class="sentence" id="1798">I don’t have the key. </span><span class="sentence" id="1799">Well, give us the key or we’ll break down the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1800">So he rummaged and he found the key. </span><span class="sentence" id="1801">And as they stormed up there and up there, he was heard to mumble under his breath, I hope they break their neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1802">Somebody heard it and he was indicted and — that he made this remark. </span><span class="sentence" id="1803">He had enough friends in the court system that witnesses came up and said oh no, you heard it wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1804">He said, I hope they don’t break their neck, because it was so dangerous to climb up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1805">They gave him the benefit of the doubt and he was permitted to retire earl — take early retirement, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1806">Now, there were people like that, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1807">And he was watched from there on and he couldn’t afford to make a wrong move, but he didn't permit his daughters to ever join the Nazi party, for the girl they have the JungmAadel or whatever, the Hitler youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1808">He could have redeemed himself to prove that he was not against them by saying I want you to join, even if it’s only pro forma. </span><span class="sentence" id="1809">No, he stuck to his principles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1810">There were people like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1811">So who’s to say who is good and who’s bad?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1812">QUESTION:  Do you get reparations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1813">ANSWER:  I don’t, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1814">My mother did, I don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1815">I got — yeah, I got a one time lump sum pre — reparations because I was deprived of my education, which was, I think 5,000 116 March 16, 2001 deutschmark at the time, in 19 — in the early 50’s, I think, under Adenauer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1816">Nothing else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1817">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you wanted to —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  — talk about that we haven’t, or any final comments that you’d like to say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1818">ANSWER:  No, I really hadn’t thought about any final comments, I just wanted to really put on record a firsthand, you know, witness account of how I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and why I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and what the circumstances were because things are, when they are retold by people who have heard the story, it’s often distorted, not intentionally, but just by repeating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1819">And I would like it to go on record. </span><span class="sentence" id="1820">I hope I have created a feeling of what the spirit was, both in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , what the mentality was of the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Celle</span> , certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1821">Why they did what th — why we did what we did, and you know, like some of them said, why do you stay so long? </span><span class="sentence" id="1822">Why — you know, why didn't you leave earlier? </span><span class="sentence" id="1823">I’ve also, when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , had people ask, you German Jews, why didn’t you fight back? </span><span class="sentence" id="1824">Why k — you know, you should have fought the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1825">It shows a total — comments like that at the time showed a total ignorance of what Nazi Germany was all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1826">How they operated, how they functioned and I mean, there were — there were people who fought back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1827">They were hauled off to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> or shot on the spot, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1828">Known as 6fter(ph) flucht es schussen(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1829">Shot while — you know, shot while trying to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1830">Okay, so there — there was no th — they were gangsters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1831">They 117 March 16, 2001 were — they didn’t play by gentlemen’s rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="1832">I mean, if you see what — what — what — what — what Hitler did to his own — to his own people whom he saw as threats, as rivals, as — you know, th-the Wurm(ph) affair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1833">Anybody that — that was no longer convenient was eliminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1834">How? </span><span class="sentence" id="1835">How does the Mafia eliminate people, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1836">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1837">So, people who say why didn't you fight back, there were people who fought back, but there was no way of beating a system where the government is the — where there is no government protection, where there is no police that you can go to, where there’s no one to — to — you can appeal to for justice, for the right thing, for protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="1838">No way of fighting that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1839">QUESTION:  Do you feel more connection to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> than you do to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ”</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, I feel — I feel very comfortable with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1840">People ask me — American Jews ask me, how can you go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after all you — ve made my peace with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1841">They’ve paid the price. </span><span class="sentence" id="1842">They’ve tried very hard to make up for — they recognize today very much what they have done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1843">They are, you know, I feel that what we know today about the way the American government acted, the Roosevelt administration acted, of ignoring not only the Saint Louis affair, but the — you know, many other — look how close did I come of being — not being accepted in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1844">You know, I’d like to find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1845">But it wasn’t all peaches and cream and not everything that was pretended, that the Jews were a political pawn, that it was inconvenient to the American and British government to admit the to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , that they wanted to s — you know, send them to <span class="COUNTRY">Madagascar</span> in transit, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1846">The Jewish state of <span class="COUNTRY">Madagascar</span> and other faraway <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they 118 March 16, 2001 would be out of the way and not in the way of the Arab situation, the oil situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1847">So when you see all of that, it’s not that one guy wears the black hat and the other guy wears the white hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1848">Everybody wears a gray hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1849">Anyway.</span></p>
