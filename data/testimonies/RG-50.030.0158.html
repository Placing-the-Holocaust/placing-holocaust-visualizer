<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Could you tell me your name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Frank Meissner, M-E-I-S-S-N-E-R.
QUESTION:  Where were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  In uh a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trest</span> , T- R-E -S - T. In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , it's called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">And it was a uh Jewish community that has been around for something like two or three hundred years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  In what <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  In <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> is exactly half way between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And it used to be a very important Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">The way it was in uh <span class="REGION">Central Europe</span> that uh Jews were mostly in the <span class="REGION">rural areas</span> , and as the industrialization of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , of <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> , took place uh more and more opportunities uh started uh (cough) bringing about uh opportunities outside the <span class="REGION">rural areas</span> and so gradually uh the real people with the guts would, leaved the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and go to bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Some of them even would go abroad or to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  Let's talk about Frank Meissner though, and Frank Meissner's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  Well, this was my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Tell us about uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trest</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Tell us about your family first.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  Well, in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was, has had a population of five thousand for years and years and years and it still does. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And uh the community from its highest uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> has dwindled gradually from something like four hundred to about uh seventy hundred (ph) in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And our family has always been one of the important families in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and has almost looked like uh generation after generation; and the Meissners would be uh presidents of the congregation. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Three or four generations that I know of - it's almost as 1f uh some couldn't avoid this opportunity and uh my dad was a uh industrialist that uh had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> for making uh shoes, wooden shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And then when uh leather shoes became uh the thing to do he had to close down the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and became in uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So uh my mother and father worked full time in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and I had a whatever you called it, German uh lady that would take care of me, and my brother-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I had a brother-in-law that was three years older by the name of Leo. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So uh this lady uh took care of me till uh 1929.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  How old were you in 1929?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Well, I was born in 1923. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I was six. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I was just about ready to go to grade, uh to <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> and uh the <span class="BUILDING">furniture factory</span> went bust during the financial troubles. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So uh we could no longer have uh anybody take care of me, and both my father and mother worked together. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">My mother worked as a uh secretary, working for my, for her brother that had a <span class="BUILDING">machine factory</span> , and Dad couldn't uh get himself a new job, and so he became what is now-a-days called a uh househusband, I presume. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Which was at that time very unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And uh because of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was uh small we didn't have a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , so when I was uh ten or eleven I had to go to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which had a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I would uh stay with a family during the weekend and come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , uh during the week, and come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> during the weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And I wasn't a very good student. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I was in fact a lousy student. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I had problems all time and uh...with teachers and low grades and my father had to go to talk to the teachers to see what they could do and I never flunked completely...and just barely going from grade to grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And at one point in 1930 ... '37, the decision was to be made whether I was going to go on to <span class="BUILDING">senior high school</span> and the decision was that I would said Dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And I said and I wouldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So he said you have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So I said uh, I'll show you. </span><span class="sentence" id="38"><span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> at that time uh if one went or flunked one subject in the curriculum, you had to go a whole year around and so I said I'll show you and within two or three months I flunked out of Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And that was in 1937. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And at that time I uh, it has already has become fashionable to uh let smart kids, teenagers to learn something with their hands because chances were that one would leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So I went to work as an apprentice in my uncle's uh <span class="BUILDING">machine factory</span> and uh then this uh possibility came about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Can we hold it for a minute? </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Because this is a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> , I think, to ask about what it was like as a Jew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">What was it like growing up as a Jew, particularly since your family was as prominent as it was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Obviously in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> like this uh you uh couldn't uh get away from being Jew, because everybody knew everybody else, whereas in bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> you could uh go pass by. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So obviously in uh <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> I got beaten up and had all sorts of problems because I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And uh we uh lived across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> and by that time uh the congregation was so small that we had to have uh mobilized everybody forthe _ group every morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So uh I was mobilized and of course getting up at six o'clock in the morning was not exactly what particularly I was interested in. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But my grandfather, my mother's father, used to live with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">He was a widower, a guy with lots of uh sense of humor and so he made it easier for me to make it easier to go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">But five crowns (ph) a week kind of on the side - that was at that time quite a bit of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Uh...
QUESTION:  Was your family very religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  Well, I mean at that time <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> had mostly religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">There was nothing in these uh little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">There was nothing except uh highly kosher and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Uh and obviously being a kid of my father who was the congregation president, we had to at least show that we behaved properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And uh the congregation was very small and very together. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And uh since most of the people from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> already had been the first generation that have left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and for instance in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , there was a it is called, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trest</span> which had at that time more Jews, two hundred, than the city of the origin. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Just like uh the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> has more Irish than Irish has in its uh state. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And so people were always very loyal to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they came from and in my, since my dad was president of the congregation, all of them would come and visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And he also would be uh paying out uh I don't know what it is called - uh there was a great deal of loyalty to the uh young and old poor people that came from the <span class="REGION">eastern provinces</span> and my dad had to help them, so we uh had quite a bit of both the western and eastern uh Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">By uh by our standards we were already the western Jews and there was always quite a bit of looking down on the eastern - the same thing that happened between the German in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and the Russian - I mean every major congregation in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> had these frictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So that's uh basically the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So as a young man then, you decided that <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> was not for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">You flunked Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Uh and you became an apprentice. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Tell us about being an apprentice with and what was it like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Well, in - I was an apprentice in the lathe, uh metal lathe uh proposition and ...
QUESTION:  I don't understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Lathe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  Oh, a lathe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  And uh at that time the apprentices of course were taking care of everybody else and with coffee and what have you and cleaning the uh <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> on Saturday afternoons. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So one didn't learn a hell of a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">But there was one week in uh uh when one went to a uh <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that by law one has to go and he taught all sorts of uh drafting and kind of a uh vocational proposition so that was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">On Thursdays one could be away from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and uh learn something. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Uh the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> had uh produced manufacture of equipment for uh bakeries and uh meat proposition - that was a very specialized <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> still exists. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">No longer in this machinery but now they make agriculture machinery. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And last time we were there in Christmas it was a terrible mess. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">But, one at least saw that it existed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So you were an apprentice, and what did you do next? </span><span class="sentence" id="83">What did you decide to do at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Well, then this uh opportunity came up with the so I went off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> for a little . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  Back up. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Tell us what a HaSharah (ph) was in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and how it worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  There was no, there was no HaSharah in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> but uh we were put together in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> to uh uh be uh prepared for going abroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So we went for three or four months a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , a little <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  How did you become interested in this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Because I was always a uh Youth Aliyah, a Zionist, youth Zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Uh that was the only thing that I was interested in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Was there a large group of young Zionists in this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Well there were maybe thirty or forty of them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  Can you describe what you did as a group, ..... Zionists ...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  Well it was just like uh like uh a youth group would. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And uh would go out on Saturdays and Sundays, and going out in to <span class="ENV_FEATURES">nature</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And uh I learned uh Hebrew and knew about <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">My dad was a very uh important Zionist, so it came natural. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Except uh I was the only one that did something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">My uh uh mother had uh, we had several opportunities to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> but my mother just couldn't to get away uh from the the whole family and in uh - well, it was this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I mean it was a major decision just like any other decision that uh American Jews that came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> - some of them took and some of them didn't take an opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And my mother has uh always going to the uh going to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And when it came down to the uh major decision it was always she couldn't get away from the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And my brother-in-law (ph) was a electric engineer and in 1938 he was a real good boy, always a good boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">That was one of my problems that I, my dad always said why can't you be uh like your brother-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I told him very simple, because I am not my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">But he was, uh he got a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anssuan_</span> in electricity in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> under the English and uh he could have gotten a good job and good uh salary and mother would never had anything with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I mean they just said impossible to be that way, that long away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And my brother-in-law was the good boy so he stayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  This is your brother-in-law?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  My brother, my brother, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">He was three years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And so he didn't take the opportunity uh opportunity and uh eventually went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with the whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So there were always opportunities to get away 1n time which was not taken, opportunity was not utilized. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I was the only one because I was the bad boy and uh I couldn't care less what my parents said.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  So you went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> for three or four months and then they uh uh helped us to develop a little bit uh kind of a uh farm proposition, learn some Hebrew and the basic idea was to go eventually to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> for several months, learn agriculture on uh <span class="DLF">farms</span> , on individual <span class="DLF">farms</span> , and then uh whenever the opportunity came to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So I lived on uh several <span class="DLF">agricultural farms</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> .. .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Before we get to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , uh can you describe what it was like for you in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="122">What was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> like and what year are we talking about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  Well, I was staying with my uncle for six months, and we were just, there was sort of a uh <span class="BUILDING">vocational school</span> basically and uh there were about uh fifty, sixty of us and all of them were then became part of the possible uh Alyah because there were always some people that had to be made uh prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">In my case it was relatively easy because I used to work on my grandfather's <span class="DLF">farm</span> but uh for most other kids that came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> uh it was a little difficult because during the summer we were we were put out on the <span class="DLF">farms</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Just uh the same thing that we did in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Let's talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Uh you're in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">When did you decide, when did you go to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and what was ...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  It's wasn't my decision. (</span><span class="sentence" id="131">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Tell me what happened?) </span><span class="sentence" id="133">By the time I was in this uh in this uh group of uh kids, it was just a question of when we could uh be uh exported to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">By that time it was not uh my decision any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I could of course have said in the last minute that I don't want to go but uh in October 1939, you just uh obviously you would immediately grab the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  What was October 1939 like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">By that time the World War II just started about two weeks I think it was, in September something. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And things were, on the surface things were relatively normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Of course uh the Jews were running around wondering how they could get out of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">By that time of course uh for many of them it was too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So the opportunity when grabbed. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I mean it has never even occurred to me that I uh, that there was any alternative because that was uh areal opportunity to get away from my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And since they were Zionists but didn't do much about it, I was the only one that did. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">As it turned out, I never eventually went to visit them (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So it's October 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">What did your group do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Well they just put us together on the on, put us together, about thirty of us and uh we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weinemunde</span> on the on the <span class="REGION">German coast</span> and went up to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">It took about twenty-four hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And of course we didn't have a clue where we would end up. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">We were taken care of for two days of this group of uh the International League for whatever you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And uh then they distributed us to different <span class="DLF">farms</span> , both in un Zealand (ph) and the main <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> and on other parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  Who was in the group? </span><span class="sentence" id="155">You talk about distributing ...
ANSWER:  Just people like me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  From all over Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  No, this was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I mean uh actually ours was basically of young people from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and this happened to be a group that on October 10 or something like this went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And then there were other groups from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , for all together about six hundred of these kids what uh over several years - we were the last ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">They were uh the Hehalutz people, that the older ones that already started ...to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> in about middle 1930". </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And we were basicaly the last one and the kids were very young kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I was 16, I was the oldest, they were kids like from 14 to 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  So you landed in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> where did you go, where you have take...
ANSWER:  I went to a little <span class="NPIP">place</span> then on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> in a uh very small uh <span class="DLF">Danish farm</span> , very uh very uh missionaries...
QUESTION:  I'm sorry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Missionaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And it was a small <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and I didn't understand anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">They didn't understand anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">It was cold and I had to uh go into the <span class="DLF">fields</span> in October and uh harvest sugar beets and things like that and for the first week it was pretty tough because still Sunday uh when they took me to the uh see the Danish minister, a Lutheran minister which spoke uh German, I really didn't have any way of uh communicate with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">But there were about uh ten or fifteen people that were in that <span class="REGION">region</span> , with a bicycle get together, and we had a uh, a teacher who would go around and keep us together, so we had about one day a week to get together. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So...
QUESTION:  Did the people on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , uh the owners of the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , uh did they know you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I mean that was the whole proposition. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And uh I on the second <span class="DLF">farm</span> that I went to I really became part of the family and uh and the boy and the girl really became my brothers and sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  Tell me about that <span class="DLF">farm</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="174">What were the people's names? </span><span class="sentence" id="175">What was the family like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Well, of course uh being Danes their name was Nielsen (ph) though you couldn't tell from anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And it was uh, for me it was a uh small <span class="DLF">farm</span> , with very diversified agriculture mostly uh dairy farming and pigs. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">This used to be uh the Danish export of cheese and uh butter and bacon. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And uh in the good old days before World War II, they were bringing in feed from abroad, mostly from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and by that time it was cut off, so then the question was how to survive during World War II because most of the Danes were not very enthusiastic about about switching exports from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> which was now impossible, to feed the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So was difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  The family's were, was named Nielsen (ph) and you said you were very close to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">What kind of things did you do with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  Well, everything that they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I mean uh working, whatever needed to be done on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and of course they had small uh groups at that time uh - ten miles was a long ways and so there would be a community get-together around the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and they would have uh invite uh neighbors for dinner, things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And I was always part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">As any kid, part of the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  Were you, can you - were you on this <span class="DLF">farm</span> when the Germans invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  Can you describe the invasion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">ANSWER:  Very easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">They had a uh, one had uh very primitive uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> actually above uh the manure behind the, in the cows and I was sitting there in the morning and, and all of a sudden I hear all those, all those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> wondering what the hell was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">That's how the Germans invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And the question was what do we do, and the answer from our group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> that took care of us said uh just uh leave alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Just uh don't uh...
QUESTION:  Let's hold and stop the tape please. (</span><span class="sentence" id="195">Technical conversation. ) </span><span class="sentence" id="196">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  Can you describe the effect of the invasion on a <span class="DLF">Denmark farm</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">ANSWER:  I even never saw a German soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">In '41, I went to a <span class="BUILDING">vocational school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">They had uh four or five months uh during the off-season when they would put, they would put together teach young kids about vocational agriculture during uh when the snow was on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and they could uh utilize their time in going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were very small, about sixty, seventy sch... uh seventy youngsters and I got scholarship and uh then had to uh work after the six months working on the uh <span class="BUILDING">agriculture school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">They had that <span class="BUILDING">agriculture school</span> , they had that <span class="BUILDING">agriculture school</span> they had a <span class="DLF">farm</span> and so I became the guy to take care of uh the hogs and the cows. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">It was of the few jobs in my life which I hated because uh IJ had to do it because I had to pay off for my uh <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and there was no way of getting away from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">It was lots of work so in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Demmark</span> at that time one had to have a <span class="BUILDING">vocational school</span> of this sort as a uh resident for turning up for the <span class="BUILDING">agriculture school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">It was part of the uh requirement so I had to have this <span class="BUILDING">vocational school</span> and uh the director of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had to give me a uh a uh a good uh (pause) well, he had to certify that I was at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , that I made OK and he just had me because I just had this uh, had to have this certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">So that was in uh '42, late '42, early '43 and in uh the middle of 1943 I finally ended up starting in <span class="BUILDING">Agriculture College</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Copenhagen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I three years B.S. in Agronomy and uh it was in October, September, October '43 when uh I uh was a uh freshman and one day I got a call, not I but the President of the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> got a call in the morning telling me that he should tell me that the Gestapo was uh on my tail and uh my landlady said I should never come back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">That was at the time when uh the Germans have gotten after the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Uh the Germans did it differently from what they have done in <span class="REGION">Central Europe</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where they uh got the Jews together in the center, in the center and then they would put the Jews together before they were to export them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Uh in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , they couldn't get away with it because the Danes would object to it so the trick that the Germans did is uh picked the people at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> so that one wouldn't see anything in front of the rest of the uh population. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">It just so happened that uh there was a German naval attache at the uh German uh ambassador, <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> and he was friendly, knowing what uh was happening and let the Danish uh Prime Minister know what the Germans had in mind and that was on uh Yom Kippur and uh the Prime Minister let the Danish chief rabbi tell the people at Yom Kippur that go and tell them then to disappear because if they will be at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the Germans will pick them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">So most of the people, the seven million, seven thousand people, the Danish uh Jews, were disappeared and the underground got them to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I think only about five hundred or so got uh went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , most of them from our group because our group, uh we went, they distribute ____ the Danish congregation so we really didn't know what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And uh so then I got this uh this uh uh the uh my lady where I used to stay called <span class="BUILDING">Copenhagen agriculture school</span> and asked the President to let me know that I shouldn't get back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again because the Gestapo pick me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So that was a chemistry class of a uh ... and the big plays where all the first-year students were taking Chemistry I, in this big <span class="BUILDING">theatre</span> and all of a sudden the janitor comes to the President of the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> who happened to be a teacher of chemistry and tell him something and the President called me by name and I came from this <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , took about a half a minute uh wondering what the hell did I do now. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And so he said your landlady called, and don't come ever back again. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So I happened to, about two or three blocks from the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> where a uh Danish uh uh Lutheran reverend whose uh whose uh young boy was a very close friend of mine, and so I went to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and said what do I do now. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So he uh made a couple phone calls and said uh everything is fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Take your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , drive uh south of uh a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">fishing village</span> south of the international headquarters of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> and a lady will take care of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And uh by that evening I was in uh <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">QUESTION:  Where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  In <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">That's how easy it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">QUESTION:  Describe that trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">You were on your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  Well, I left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> with the lady and she took me uh at night uh to the little fishing uh <span class="DLF">port</span> and there was a tiny little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> for thirteen, there were thirteen people of us and they just took us over to uh to uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malmo</span> and took about an hour and a half and it was October - very rought seas. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">It was lots of people left there <span class="NPIP">outside</span> out, because the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> was very rough, and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">So by that time the Swedes already had uh uh prepared uh the need for putting the people together to uh take care of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  What, as you were on your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> going to to meet this lady, what were you thinking? </span><span class="sentence" id="230">What were you ...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">ANSWER:  Not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">All I did is took my chemistry books - that's the only thing that I had and I didn't have a clue what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And on the several days and months and years after I have found out what really was happening, that the Danes have taken care of their Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And that I was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And uh I still don't understand many of the things that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Everybody has his own stories, uh explanations, interpretation, and so uh by that time the Swedes already had their organization for uh taking care of the Danes and uh taking uh underground has taken about two or three months to get all the Jews across to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and I was one of the earlier ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">QUESTION:  What happened to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="238">What did you do when you landed in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">ANSWER:  Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">There was a old <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> where they put the people up and uh I went to see, the same evening I went to see uh uh "Gone With The Wind.” </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And then I have read that book and was fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And then a couple days after (cough) came some recruiter from some uh <span class="BUILDING">sugar factories</span> that needed people to harvest uh sugar beets and seemed like uh the work was pretty tough but they paid well so with a buddy of mine we went and signed or signed up and uh worked for about three weeks and then my buddy had a brillant idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Said look, since we, since we are uh students from the <span class="BUILDING">Agriculture College</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> why don't we offer our services to the <span class="BUILDING">Agriculture College</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Upsala</span> (ph) in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> where the agri... <span class="BUILDING">agi school</span> was uh located. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I thought it was a idiotic idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Who needed us? </span><span class="sentence" id="246">But I thought OK, it was worth ten cents and low and behold they said come on over. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So that's how we looked or came eventually back to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Upsala</span> and that I thought was really a good luck.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  What did you do there? </span><span class="sentence" id="249">What was your job?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">ANSWER:  Oh, I was uh working in a uh in a uh <span class="BUILDING">lab</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="251">Pause - technical conversation.) </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So I was uh working in a uh feed (ph) lab. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">But that's OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Was and at that time 1t was much easier to send uh uh food packages to my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">By that time they already were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Let's pause here. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">You're talking about your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Had you been hearing from them all these years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">ANSWER:  Yes, every week I had a letter about what they were doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  Tell us what was happening to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  Well, obviously uh the seven uh Jewish people in the in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trest</span> gradually uh had their jobs uh they couldn't continue them. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Finally they uh took them and concentrated them from fifteen or so <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> into little groups where the family would be able only to have uh two or three uh hou... <span class="NPIP">places</span> to get together. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And every week or month there would be additional squeezing and uh people would have to give their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> away and uh uh gradually would uh have to go to uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> and take a couple of thirty (ph) uh kilos (ph) that they could take along with them, and then they would be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> for uh about a year and that in October or September 1944 I would, I found out that they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and that's the last I ever heard from my entire family. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">My uh grandfather and my uh mother's brother, my brother and his uh new uh he got married - the whole family just disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">That was about uh October '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So after (cough) from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , uh from uh <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> I eventually ended up in the Czech exile government uh Army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  How did that ? </span><span class="sentence" id="269">How did that happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="270">This is October '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">You're...
ANSWER:  It was uh, I was uh, the exile government said uh look, if you want a Czech uh passport, you have to volunteer for the government uh exile army in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So I thought, well, how will they ever get me there, and it just so happened that they tried out at that time a possibility of uh getting some of the volunteers from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , with some uh BOAC, uh British Overseas Airline, and so uh they tried and tried and tried, thirteen times after a uh getting to the un <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> and never, never, never was there an opportunity to try this uh trick, and so I used to leave my luggage in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copen</span> ... uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> because I never believed they would take us over. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">The thirteenth time they finally did. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">That's how I got to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in 19 uh September I guess 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">QUESTION:  What did you do when you landed in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  Oh they uh went into some <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I didn't ever know where it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So they debriefed us and then I went to the Czech Army and...
QUESTION:  Where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">ANSWER:  Pardon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">QUESTION:  Where did they have the Czech army training?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">ANSWER:  They had it uh near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">South end on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And then after a little while they wanted uh uh the Royal Air Force needed some people that could speak English and Czech so I volunteered for that and for about uh over a year or year and a half I was in the Royal Air Force, in the Czech uh part of the Royal Air Force and I since I didn't, already at that time I had problems with my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">The only thing I was good enough for was weather forecasting and they put someplace up in <span class="REGION">northern Scotland</span> , about thirty or forty miles north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Inverness</span> , and at that time by sheer chance and uh a captain that uh was in charge of uh education on the (cough) on the base made it possible for me to finish my my uh <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> by writing or doing it by uh writing...
QUESTION:  I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I don't understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">ANSWER:  The Czech uh <span class="BUILDING">school</span> would uh, or the Czech exile government had a uh <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> for the kids uh that uh belonged to the uh Czech uh ministers of the government, and uh so the captain arranged for me to uh do uh my communication long-distance and uh so eventually I got my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So uh that made it possible for me after World War II to to go back to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So then uh when the war was over in <span class="REGION">Central Europe</span> in May 1945 I uh went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> looking for my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">By that time I thought maybe it would have been long enough time to, for them to come back, but they were not and uh a lady that was in uh in uh the <span class="INT_SPACE">mail room</span> in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was a friend of our family's and she wrote to me and says, your folks have not come back and we have very small chances that they might be. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So that was in uh May or June 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So that's the end of the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  What did you do at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">ANSWER:  Well, I was uh, at that time I was 1n the Air Force, and uh decided there was no purpose for me to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So I required to get to be uh taken (technical conversation), so I was demobilized in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> instead of in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , and so I was through in January '46 and immediately started going back to the University of uh agriculture, the <span class="BUILDING">University of Copenhagen</span> and then the Danes of course took care of me just as if I were a Dane, and I got uh scholarship and all sorts of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And then uh in part uh during the undergraduate work I uh worked as a uh uh a foreign correspondent to some Czech newspapers and did some work for the Ministry of Agriculture in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Enough to make a little extra. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And so I went back in 1948 when I graduated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> and the Communists came in.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> and then eventually came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">QUESTION:  Mr. Meissner, thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">We appreciate your coming.</span></p>
