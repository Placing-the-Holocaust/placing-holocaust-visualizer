<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Yes, it was a modern <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> is a — as it grew, during the time after the first World War, this was under the Tsarist Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  But then, when Pilsudski came to power in 1918, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> regained her independence, after 123 years of nonexistence, so to speak, of — <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> only existed only as partitions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> <span class="COUNTRY"> Poland</span> was divided actually into three segments, and this was Prussian, Russian, and Austro-Hungary. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So actually, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was part of the Tsarist domain. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">January 27, 2015</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So, when <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> became independent again, and the three parts became united, 123 years is still quite a while, because it 1s more than living memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Several generations are comprised in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Had people changed very much? </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Could you understand one another — I mean psychologically?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  Well, there were different, let’s say, frames that the Poles grew, that say, Germans were very anti-Polish, and Hakatay(ph) was the organization that even forbade the Polish language to be used at <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  Russians were also trying to bring their influence to the point. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And then, the most tolerant part was the au — aus — aus — aus —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Austro-Hungarian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  Aust-Austro-Hungarian part. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Yeah, so that was was a — a little better for schooling, secondary schooling and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And let’s say Poles from <span class="REGION">Galicia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  You know, they were a little different in character than let’s say, Poles that were slightly Germanized under the ger — the Prussian operation, and the Poles living under the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So, this process of fusing us together was actually a great, let’s say, accomplishment of the Catholic church, because they mostly — the Poles were of Catholic faith, and that was — the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was actually the strongest party that January 27, 2015 existed in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> , because they mostly — the Poles were of Catholic faith, and that was — the church was actually the strongest party that January 27, 2015 existed in — in Poland. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But then when Pilsudski became the Marshall of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> — this was in 1914, and officially <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> regained her independence in the *18, he was assigned a task of, let’s say, fusing th-the different characters of people that grew in different segments of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  So what were some of the — I mean, just curiosity — you say the Galicianas are different than those who were — and <span class="REGION">Galicia</span> was under Austro-Hungarian rule?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  What kind of character did the one have in comparison to the other two, and so on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  Let’s say the — the — let’s say the Germans, Poles, from the <span class="REGION">German part</span> , from the <span class="REGION">Prussian part</span> were, let’s say, a little bit more like Germans, very orderly, let’s say the work that they accomplished was more thorough than let’s say the group of Poles in the east, under the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And let’s say the Galicians were also a little bit closer to — to — to — to German influence. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">But all together, united by the faith, you know, we were very quickly re — reburn(ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Reborn.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="575">QUESTION:  Well, here’s a question that’s a bit provocative, and I know in advance that it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">But there is the image, that when the war started, and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , they were met by cavalry officers on horses and swords.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="587">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">January 27, 2015</p>
<p>ANSWER:  We had our own design, let’s say WSK Kalisz and that PZL-11. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">These <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> were not large in numbers, because this was a developing industry in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , the aircraft industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , they were not built in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> vic — Vickers tanks from — imported from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Vickers tanks</span> from — imported from England. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And we had the motorized units. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">We had the motorized brigade that actually later on, became the first armored division in the west, under General Maczek, af you — if you heard.</span></p>

<p>ANSWER:  And at that time also <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> joined the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">So we had some — part of the invasion of ch — Slovaks into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , the German armies, and then armies from the <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span> that was coming in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="606">QUESTION:  And that was all September 1“, 1939?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">ANSWER:  Yes, September 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">So, wi— most of our defenses were directed against the Germans coming from the west. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">We did not expect the Russians will stab us in the back on the 17" of September. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">They attacked to come and free their people that were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kresy</span> , which was the <span class="RIVER">Volhynia</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polesie</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Podole</span> , and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nowogrdodek</span> , closer to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , as we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">So <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kresy</span> were liberated, quotation marks, by the — by the Russians.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  Uh-huh, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">ANSWER:  — going on, I don’t know if you see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">I didn’t see it, but I would like to see it, because there was a great contribution to the victory of the allied effort during the second World War, by giving the — giving the English and French the secrets of enigma. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">What was started was the getting in, was the <span class="BUILDING">mathematical school</span> that the Poles attended in 1932. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And the connections that the <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had with <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span> was via the enigma. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">They were sending codes, and all different secret January 27, 2015 information. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">So the Poles started getting interest in it, and Zygalski, Rafski(ph), and there was a third name that I forgot, but the — these were the three codebreakers, later on that they work for the Polish secret service. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And this was in July 1939, when from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> signed the agreement to be defended by <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , in case that we get attacked by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">But anyway, going back to that point that the British paid a visit to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pery(ph</span> ) was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the suburb of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Poles had copied two machines that were intercepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">When they send this to East Prussia, it went via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span> , it went via Warsaw. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So the secret service took the machines, dismembered them, photographed them, do everything possible to reproduce the machines. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And some of the copies were so identical that the Germans wouldn’t be able to recognize which is the original, which is the copy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">QUESTION:  Oh, so then you started fueling disinformation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">ANSWER:  Yeah, so when they came over, the British, Knox and Denniston, I think, they were two gentlemen, and the Frenchman, Bernard, Colonel Bernard came over, and they were actually exchanging their accomplishment that field of cryptology, with the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And they were very surprised when the Poles simply showed them that, we have two gifts from you. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">One machine for the British, M — M — MI-6, I believe, and the French secret — military secret to Colonel Bernard.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="648">ANSWER:  I'd say, speaking of government, Polish government, when <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was attacked, escaped, with a lot of trained personnel; most of the Polish airmen went through <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> — <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> was ally of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> — and most of them escaped through <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> to the west.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
