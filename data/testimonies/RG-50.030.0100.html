<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you tell me your name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I'm Ernest James.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Where were your born and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ord</span> , <span class="REGION">Nebraska</span> , on April 23, 1920.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Would you tell me something about your childhood and family, growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Well, I came from rather a large family. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">There's nine of us, and incidentally they're, all but one are still living and we get together a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Uh, uh, I was the next to the youngest of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">We were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">farming community</span> in uh, <span class="REGION">central Nebraska</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Uh, I had a very uh, good childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Uh, uh, graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in 1938, and immediately thereafter uh, in fact the day I graduated I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and left for <span class="REGION">California</span> , where I worked in uh, the U.S. Forest Service. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Uh, I worked there until about 19 uh, oh 40. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And then with the war coming along uh, I decided that rather than be drafted I would uh, join the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I joined the California National Guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Uh, uh, we were called into active service at uh, in March of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I was in the infantry and had uh, basic training and rose uh, by uh, the time the war started I was a sergeant. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Uh, we were uh, uh, right after Pearl Harbor we were called in to uh, be the defensive troops along the the <span class="DLF">coast</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> and I had a lot of experiences in uh, running patrols, uh, trying to uh, set it up so that if the Japanese came, why we could uh, keep them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I uh, uh, was uh, I applied for officer's candidate school in the engineers in uh, June of 1942 and was accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Uh, went through training in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Belvoir</span> and uh, uh, was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Uh, I went up to <span class="BUILDING">Platsburg Barracks</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> where I had uh, I was assigned to a com...engineer combat battalion and we trained our troops up there uh, uh, from about 19 uh, 19...through 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">We then went uh, uh, overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Went down to <span class="REGION">North Africa</span> about the time of the uh, that uh, Roosevelt was at the Yalta Conference, and uh, at that conference they decided to uh, that they're going to invade Europe so rather than go to the <span class="REGION">Far East</span> , we went up to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> where we prepared for the invasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Uh, after uh, uh, going for about several months in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> training for the invasion, we were ready and in uh, June we uh, uh, got on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> and our trip, our troops were some of the first that landed on D-Day uh, uh, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Uh, we uh, were involved in virtually all of the uh, combat operations of the 1st Army in 7th Corps. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Uh, captured <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherbourg</span> and and the uh, uh, Battles of St. Lowe (ph) and uh, uh, moving on through over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> uh, we turned north and went up to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , through uh, uh, through <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aucken</span> (ph) we were uh,...one of the things that I remember was uh, how wonderful the people were in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , but the minute we hit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aucken</span> uh, people were somber. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">They resented us and uh, uh, it was there we first started uh, getting the feeling that uh, uh, the Germans were more...uh, were worst than just a uh, enemy, that uh, we started hearing stories about uh, uh, the uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Uh, I might go back to a couple of recollections that I do have of uh, uh, the uh,...what was happening over in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Back in 1938 uh,...well, maybe it was earlier than that, '36...
QUESTION:  We really would like to stick with your story and what you experienced.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Well, this 1s what I experienced. (</span><span class="sentence" id="29">Oh, OK.) </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Uh, uh, I discussed uh, the World War I with some uh, with a gentleman that had uh, been in that, and he told me that uh, he felt that we weren't finished with the Germans, that the Nazi uh, the Nazi uh, that were coming in uh, in power, uh, that there was going to be a war, and he impressed on uh, on me this. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Then uh, in 1939 I met my first, I had my first contact and inkling that there was uh, something happening over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I was with a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> group and they sponsored a Jewish uh, family that came over, and I remember this this family...very brilliant people, and uh, wonderful people and they uh, they were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">This was a <span class="BUILDING">Congregational Church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Well, they came in and uh, we got acquainted with them, and I remember talking to uh, the daughter and she was telling me about how they were taking the Jewish people and putting them into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and this was in 1938 or '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And uh, we couldn't, we couldn't comprehend that that type of thing was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">However, the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> did sponsor several Jewish people coming uh,...Jewish families coming over and uh, wouldn't it have been wonderful if we had of known then what actually was happening, but that my...the first inkling that I had that anything such as this happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Now, getting back to uh, uh, getting back to uh, going into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I had several uh, instances where we we found uh, people who were uh, displaced people from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and other uh, <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and uh, but not a not a lot of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Apparently, as we moved on through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , these people were uh, were uh, carried back behind the <span class="DLF">German lines</span> and as a consequence, only those that may have hidden someplace uh, uh, were the ones that we saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Uh, I do remember one time...uh, it was uh, not too long before uh, we hit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nordhausen</span> that uh, we went into a large uh, oh <span class="DLF">German farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">It was a...there was a baron that was that had an <span class="REGION">estate</span> and uh, he had virtually a <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> , a small <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Uh, we went into into this <span class="REGION">area</span> and uh, uh, there were a lot of uh, well, slave labors. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Uh, uh, they were probably uh,...they were Polish, uh, possibly some Russians and there were some Italians there. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Why there were Italians I don't know, but uh, uh, the baron uh, came out and asked me if I could do something about these horrible people that were uh, stealing all his food and we uh.....I I was a platoon commander at the time, and uh, so he invited me in for some wine, and so I uh, went over to my uh, sergeant and asked him to get uh, two of our people. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">One was of Polish uh, extraction and could speak Polish and German. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">The other was Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">His name of Pecares (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Well uh, they went over and talked to these people while I went in to talk to the baron. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Well, I went in there and he had these beau...these beautiful uh, arms, guns and uh, medieval type armament on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and then uh, he had apparently been a big game hunter. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Uh, the uh, baron told me how horrible these people were and uh, uh, how the Germans were uh, being uh, victimized by them. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Well, in talking to this man...he had uh, he had been an editor of a newspaper uh, somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and uh, in asking him about the Nazis, why of course he didn't know that all these things were happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Uh, uh, and he pointed out that he had opened up his, part of his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">He had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">They were all uh, either wounded Germans or wounded civilians uh, that were in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Uh, after uh, I had my glass of wine with him, I went back to talk to the uh, to the Polish and the Italian men. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Well their story was quite interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">These people were kept in virtual slavery in this in this <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and uh, they uh, uh, they weren't allowed to have religious services. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">They weren't allowed to marry. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And one of the interesting things was uh, one of them told how they uh, if one, if a man and a woman wanted to get together...1ncidentally they all lived in in communal uh, uh, <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in effect...a man and woman wanted to get together and become man and wife, why they uh, stood and told each other that they uh, were were man and wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">There's of course no religious services, but to them that was a marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Uh, but uh, uh, these these people were hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">They had nothing to eat, and the only food was what the baron had and so we told the baron that he was going to have to feed them and that we could do nothing about uh, them stealing, uh, well actually taking food, that uh, we were going to leave and that uh, uh, we we gave instructions to the people to be reasonable and fair and whatever happened after that I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But this was one incident that we ran into uh, rather often in uh, to one degree or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Uh, uh, it was amusing that uh, the baron was uh,...of course, he knew nothing about what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Uh, the same as uh, another <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there's a man that was an umbrella manufacturer, and he knew nothing...uh, we took over his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to stay...he knew nothing about the what the Nazis were doing, and he wasn't a Nazi, but in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we found him in a Nazi uniform uh, as a local official, and we even found a picture with he and Hitler. (</span><span class="sentence" id="66">Laughter) But it was uh,...I relate these to show the the people over there almost universally in quotes did not know what the Nazis were doing, and they were not Nazis, yet we found most of them did know. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Now getting over uh, towards the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , uh, uh, in uh, one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , uh, very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nordhausen</span> ...it couldn't have been more than oh thirty or forty miles away, up in the Hartz (ph) Mountains, we came across this almost bucolic scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">A beautiful uh, landscaped uh, uh, <span class="REGION">estate</span> and <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> around uh, and walking around were girls pushing uh, baby carriages and uh, uh, young pregnant women. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Well, we found out later that these women had become pregnant with uh, uh, German soldiers and the children were uh, taken after they had reached a few years old and put into a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , taken away from their mothers and put into a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and later on as they grew up, there was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Now the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military camp</span> ...these kids were actually put into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and trained uh, as soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Uh, it was kind of interesting that when we came upon the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> uh, we had uh, we had a little fire from uh, uh, back uh, behind some <span class="DLF">barricades</span> , and we found out that they were they were kids fourteen and fifteen years of age, but we talked them into stopping it, and these were actual children that were uh, uh, that were out of this this little <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> I don't know, but it was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Hartz Mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I relate this to show that three or four days later we came across <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nordhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Uh, a diametric uh, scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Uh, we were uh, our troops, the 238th Engineer Combat Battalion uh, was a uh, attached to the 7th Corps and we normally were then attached to any division that needed combat engineer uh, needed more combat engineer troops, primarily if they had uh, if they had <span class="DLF">bridges</span> to build or <span class="DLF">roads</span> or any type of engineering work, but we were assigned uh, uh, in this <span class="REGION">area</span> to the uh, uh, the Ist Division, the 104th Division and or the 3rd Armored. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Uh, these troops, the infantry and armored, would move ahead of us and we'd come in and uh, repair the <span class="DLF">roads</span> so that the uh, the support troops could come up or we would go ahead and build <span class="DLF">bridges</span> so they could move across them. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Uh, the 104th uh, Infantry uh, uh, and I believe the 3rd Armored went through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nordhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Uh, when they arrived there they found the most horrible situation that uh, a person can ever explain. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Uh, I came in probably a day or two days later. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">It 1t couldn't have been more than a day later. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Uh, my first recollection was moving in with my uh, with my platoon into a uh, <span class="DLF">railroad yards</span> , and German civilians were uh, well looting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">They would break open the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> and take any food out and of course they hadn't had any food and uh, so they'd uh, go get anything they could in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Well, there over on a <span class="DLF">siding</span> there was this one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that uh, nobody had broken into and we went over there and uh, the smell incidentally was horrible, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">The closer we got to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> uh, the worse the smell got. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">When I got over there I saw fluids dripping out of the the uh, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We opened one up and uh, uh, all I can compare it to is a group of fish slithering out of a net. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">These people were packed in uh, and they were dead and they had started into deteriorate. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">The uh, the body fluids were dripping out and we...uh, well, many of us got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Uh, other uh, groups of our battalion were in uh, other parts of the uh, of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">What uh, we did uh, was to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...after we'd found all this, we went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and uh, ordered all the able-bodied people to...men, to come out and help bury. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Uh, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> uh, uh, as I've heard since...there was actually two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> but I I have no recollection of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I...it all melds into one...uh, uh, I didn't know it at the time but one was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Dora</span> and the other was uh, was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nordhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Well, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Dora</span> was uh, I believe near a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> and uh, uh, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> uh, you could be in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and look into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Well the people all swore they knew nothing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Uh, each of them must have been blind because we could see into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and see the dead bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Uh, I remember a couple of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I remember opening a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span> and seeing partially burned bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I remember the bodies in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , uh, some alive, some dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Uh, in some instances there were people who were alive but barely alive that were laying right next to people that were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">The uh, we got uh, all the able-bodied men that we could and we dug rough <span class="DLF">trenches</span> with our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulldozers</span> and then we made the Germans and the German civilians uh, shovel uh, the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> and make them perfect. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">They were beautiful <span class="DLF">trenches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Uh, straight up and down, across, up and very clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">The dirt was piled uh, up above the <span class="DLF">trench</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">They...we allowed them to have masks over their face, but we didn't allow them any kind of gloves. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">They had to handle the dead bodies with their bare hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">We felt uh, rather strongly about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Today I don't know whether I'd do the same thing but uh, at that time uh, there was a a hatred, if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We uh, made them carry uh, each individual body uh, they, on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretchers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Now they made <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretchers</span> out of oh <span class="DLF">doors</span> , uh, they'd take two poles and put uh, a coat in between, or take real <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretchers</span> ...any type of makeshift stretcher, but one person on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> , four people carrying them. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">They took them over. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">They laid them out neatly. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We made them lay them out neatly and where they could put their hands over them, and then carry them and lay them in <span class="DLF">line</span> in the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> uh, and then I don't know how they were buried because we left because the uh, before they were uh, covered up. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">But we tried to stick them with detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Uh, I'll never forget seeing partially burned bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I saw a few little children. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Uh, uh, everybody was emaciated. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Uh, these people apparently had been, well obviously were workers in a <span class="BUILDING">V-2 factory</span> , in a Mescherschmidt (ph) factory that they had there. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Uh, the <span class="BUILDING">Mescherschmidt's factory</span> was uh, uh, in I believe three <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> and uh, I won't go into detail about the about the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , but needless to say we went into uh, we went into these and uh, they were the the ultimate of German precision, but all of the work was done by slave labor and the slave labor was uh, worked until they got sick and then they were and then they either died or they were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Uh, there apparently was no medical attention or any other type of attention and there was no food any <span class="NPIP">place</span> around. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Possibly the Germans had taken what there was but there definitely was not any in the uh, <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">The <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> themselves that the that the uh, that the uh, uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or where these people were housed were large uh,...I don't recall whether they were brick or wood buildings...but uh, filthy, uh, dirty, and it was just...the entire the entire uh, experience was something that even though we had seen uh, some of the things such as the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camps</span> out on the <span class="DLF">farms</span> , where the people weren't treated quite as bad...uh, this was...we just never even conceived of this type of thing happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Uh, we did not know at the...I didn't even think about it, whether these were uh, were Jews or displaced people from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or uh, where they were from. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> out on the <span class="DLF">farms</span> , they mostly were displaced people, but in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dora</span> , I think that the last of the Jewish people were uh, were in there in addition to others uh, but it...I just can't remember uh, uh, any of the stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">The the picture was so horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Uh, to this day uh, I'm normally a uh, person that's rather complacent, and I do not get into controversial discussions, but the one <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I get angry, and obviously angry, is when I hear people question that this existed, and I've had this happen several times and my answer uh, with expletives 1s that yes, it did exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I saw it and I smelled it and I've got pictures of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Our battalion photographer took uh, uh, oh twelve or fourteen photographs of which I've uh, given to the uh, <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> and uh, uh, it's kind of interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We had two photographers. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Uh, one one's name was Garfinkel. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">He was a Jewish fellow, and Garfinkel could speak Yiddish and German and uh, we used to uh, have Garfinkel come over and interview German prisoners and he delighted in speaking Yiddish to them and uh, of course they could do nothing, nothing about it, but we we never controlled that type of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">He uh, he usually interviewed them and and got what we wanted out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Garfinkel may or may not have been the one that took these. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">We had two photographers, and I think we have it on record uh, of who did. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Uh, the photographs were taken by the 238th Engineers and they are uh, the original photographs. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I know that they were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">They were sent...they're probably in the uh, in the archives, because we sent uh, the copies of them through channels as we did any document we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Uh...
QUESTION:  Did you...did you through an interpreter perhaps uh, speak with any of the survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  Uh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Uh, the reason was that the survivors were uh,...they couldn't speak, the ones that were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">They were, they were almost dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Uh, and uh, what we what we did, we took care of burying...we took care of seeing that they were buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Uh, apparently there were troops that came in after us that took care of the medical...uh, gave them any medical uh, uh, treatment that they needed, but we didn't we didn't have contact with uh, any of the ones that were left alive uh, as far as I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Many of these things fade back and I I really can't remember.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  Well, uh, this this was kind of interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Uh, we ran across many people that were starved and uh, uh, I remember in in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> shortly after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nordhausen</span> , we we came onto a uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camp</span> where the people were very hungry, and in this they had uh, uh, Russian prisoners of war as well as Polish and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I don't think there was any Jewish people in uh, in this, but uh, they immediately of course asked us for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And uh, uh, we started feeding them. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Our doctor came over and blew his stack. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">He said you do not feed those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">You will kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And this actually happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I am told that it actually happened that if you fed them, they'd die and uh, in one in one uh, case we met uh, we came across an American prisoner of war camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Actually we came up to it, and it had already been liberated and the American prisoners of war were coming out of it, and of course we immediately, we'd give them anything we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Again our doctor uh, uh, put out orders that nobody was to feed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We were to take them, put them in a compound and that the medical people would come in and feed them uh, to bring them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Uh, some who were uh, given food immediately got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Uh, I uh, only recall a couple of times where we did give them food. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I remember one time when when some uh, some of those people found some meat that uh, was that uh, had worms in it, maggots in it, and they took it and brushed it out and started eating it and we had to forcefully take 1t away from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Because they would have almost certainly died. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Those were uh,...I do uh,...uh, I wrote my wife, who...she was my girlfriend then...I I wrote her quite a few letters and uh, we couldn't discuss many of these things in the letters, however I do have uh, uh, I have one uh, uh, little piece that I I wrote. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I'd like to read if if you would. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Uh, this is April 23rd, 1945, and this is about ten days after we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nordhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">My wife's name was Faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I said: Faith, I'm one year older today. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Twenty-five. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">At least I think it's the 23rd of April. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">You loose track of those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">No gray hairs yet but if this work keeps on uh, there will be. (</span><span class="sentence" id="170">Cough) Uh, this 1s...today is one of those cold dreary days that would be best spent by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">That kind of life is far away, especially when everyone is hating each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">These last few weeks I've seen what the Germans are really like. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">You see the people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> themselves, and you wonder if the master race is really human. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">What is in congruous, the civilians complain to us that the forced laborers are looting their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> of food and uh, moving in on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Uh, the very same thing the Nazis did to their enemies. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">They have such an innocent manner. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">All I can say to them without losing my temper is, you brought them here. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">What a far cry from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Now we couldn't write details uh, of the of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp, and</span> so I never put it down in writing, but this does, behind the <span class="DLF">lines</span> you can see what I was thinking uh, after that experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Any other things that you might uh,...?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="257">ANSWER:  Well, this...no...I've tried, I've tried to uh, to bring that back but I can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Uh, uh, I do remember the large <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and I do remember uh, uh, opening an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> , but what...where that was in relation to other things, I I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">There were so many things happening and and frankly we were so tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Uh, we had, we were moving sometimes uh, fifty or sixty miles a day and working day and night and uh, we were just uh, uh, we were just dead on our feet, and uh, one of the problems that we had in relation to this type of recollection is that uh, we were numb. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Uh, we were emotionally numb. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And so uh, many of those details are are difficult, uh, difficult to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Uh, some of my memories are stimulated by the photos that I have, but I can't tell whether it's a it's a remembering or whether it's looking at the photo and that is impressed as a memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Uh, uh, I do know that uh, you can see into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">That 1s definite. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Uh, I couldn't figure how in the how the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> didn't know what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I had heard uh, others say that they had been, that people had been shot right out or killed right out in broad daylight there. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I didn't see it but that's uh, uh, that does tell how how open uh, it apparently was. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Uh, additionally I'm not sure whether those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that we saw were coming in or going out. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Uh, uh, I would assume that they were coming in, however I've heard later that the Germans were moving them back, but we were getting awfully close to the __ <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River</span> so they didn't have very uh, very many other <span class="NPIP">places</span> to move them, and whether they had come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> or not, uh, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I assume that some of them had come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  When you left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , could you just tell us briefly where you went?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  Well, we uh, uh, in about uh, June or it must have been July because the 4th of July I spent in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Uh, uh, the civil government came in and took over and we moved back to uh, back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> where as engineers we became the ones that maintained <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">redeployment camps</span> and uh, we uh, kept oh the water supply and <span class="DLF">roads</span> and everything such as that, and we kept that up until October. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Then I finally uh, got my orders to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and uh, I couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I got the Queen Elizabeth. (</span><span class="sentence" id="277">Laughter) And I'll never forget the difference between all the deprivations we had and then getting on the Queen Elizabeth where we had waiters for our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> and uh, we could go to the <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> and get scotch and soda and uh, oh that was <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="278">Laughter) And then when I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the first thing that I remember is the Red Cross being on the <span class="DLF">docks</span> with great big uh, uh, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> loaded with milk, and they gave us all the milk we wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">See we hadn't had milk for oh two years, fresh milk, and that was the thing that we that we liked the most. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">But after that I I landed about the 13th of October and I called my girlfriend up and told her I was coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and she asked when and I told her and I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> on the 17th. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Met her the 17th and the 18th we were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And she's still with me, after forty-five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Is there anything else that I, that we might...I can't I can't think of anything else...well, I I can add uh, there are uh, quite a few people who are in my uh, uh, in the 238th Engineer Combat Battalion Association. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">We still meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">We've had forty-four meetings, every year since then. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">It's a small group - five hundred people originally in it and we still have two hundred that are active. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Many of those do remember uh, uh, the incidents. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">I've made several tapes which I've given to the uh, to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> and uh, I'm having, we're having a meeting next week and at that time why uh, uh, we've invited a member of the Holocaust Museum to come over and we'll talk in detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">One of the things that that I have noticed uh, (cough), excuse me...uh, over the years uh, uh, why we didn't talk about this, about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nordhausen</span> , I don't know, but it was years before uh, we had any discussion upon it. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I never recall discussing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nordhausen</span> in to any degree in any of our meetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Now it wasn't because we wanted to put it out of our mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">It uh,...I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Uh, it was only after uh, we had uh, uh, found the photographs...uh, the commanding officer had the photographs along with several hundred others of the battalion and we got to discussing that and then I believe that uh, early in the 1980's that there was a trend towards uh, publicizing the fact that all this happened, probably because of what I'd experienced...people denying that it existed, and uh, even today I find that people in that unit are uh, rather reluctant to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Now why this is I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">It may be because their memories have uh, have slipped. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Uh, I could only find four or five who would uh, uh, say that they recalled this. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I've tried to get them to talk about it and uh, I can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">They'll say well, yes, I remember that but they won't go in to detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I'm wondering if possibly they may have uh, unconsciously put it out of their minds. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">It was so horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Uh, I can't I cannot believe uh, in my own mind that people are are capable of that, and in my own mind I think I do separate the actual accident or actual incident uh, with the uh, with how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Do you get what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="303">The uh, uh, the fact that people did that versus the physical dead bodies is is to a degree separated in my own mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I can't uh, I guess subconsciously I can't believe that it uh, that it could have been done, yet uh, uh, the odor is still firmly impressed in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Uh, if I smell a dead body of any kind I immediately think about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So uh, it did happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Uh, I I am pleased that the uh, the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> and that others are uh, uh, trying to uh, document all of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I I believe in my own mind that if uh, if it isn't documented, more and more people are going to come by and say, did it really happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I can say it happened because I saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">But those of us that saw it are probably within ten or fifteen years of not being here, and there'll be nobody that saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And uh, these documentaries like this are the only thing that will be existing uh, and so uh, I, every opportunity I get now I talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I don't want to hold back anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">The sordid details are very important uh, because they they tend to emphasize that man's inhumanity to man 1s is there and one other thing that I can say...uh, uh, a little incident happened to me that uh, is unrelated to the Holocaust but it's related to the, to what can happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">We were crossing...we were building a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine River</span> just before _ fell, and I was in charge of of preparing the the uh, <span class="REGION">enemy shore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">We had crossed __, come up and had a slit of land north. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">This was near . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">We were cleaning out all of the uh, civilians that were in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">We didn't want any German in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , so we just vacated their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , kicked them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Uh, they could have gone over and thrown a bomb on our <span class="DLF">bridge</span> and knocked it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Anyhow uh, each officer took an enlisted man and uh, we went up one <span class="DLF">street</span> and down the other, knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , uh, told the people they had to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">They had ten minutes to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Where are they going to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="323">You go that way, and you'll be directed, and that was...that way was back away from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine River</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I went up to this one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and uh, as the person that was in there opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , this young corporal from a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="REGION">Kansas</span> uh, was there with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">He snapped to, clicked his heels together, put his gun up like this, and all I could think was my God, a Nazi storm trooper. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I have never forgotten that incident, because here was young Mr. <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">This is the all American boy, and we're in a position of power and he turned to a Nazi like...man...I corrected him but I've never forgotten that. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Given the right circumstances, it can still happen.</span></p>
