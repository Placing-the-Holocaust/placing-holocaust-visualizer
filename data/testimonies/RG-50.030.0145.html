We put you all to work and...uh...you're gonna work. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And then it was the 28th of October in 1942, they had...uh...sent out some...uh...fliers that next day all the people should...should get together and they should assemble themselves in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called the <span class="BUILDING">Democracy place</span> . </span><span

class="sentence" id="109">Right and left. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We didn't have at that time an idea what's all about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But we felt that something 1s wrong because all the older people and the sick ones were going on side and the one who could...could still work was going on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">When it came to us, we were standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> together, my father, my mother and myself and my grandmother and my aunt, they were elderly. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And because of them, he put us all in the bad <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">We...my mother got very scared and she told

class="sentence" id="119">Maybe you can...uh...you save our lives.” </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And ...uh...the Lithuanians just pulled us away and with a...with the guns, they beat us up and they throw us in the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">You could call a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> which was all fenced up. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">In the evening there were accumulated about 10,000 people in that...uh...small compound...small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">What our <span class="NPIP">destination</span> we still didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">We...we thought that maybe they're gonna give us other work. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We never thought they're gonna kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">After all 10,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But the Germans had their own plans already. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">They had all prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">They had taken out the Jewish and Russian prisoners to <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> and they dig...dug <span class="DLF">trenches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And then...uh...they...uh...put machine guns and then they're going...there they they're gonna kill us and...and bury us. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">As we were accumulated...as we got assembled in that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> (sigh) we didn't know...we were https://collections.ushmm.org confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We didn't know what happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">The people were crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">They were separating children from old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">We didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">My father wasn't here. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I was just my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">For some reason, a instinct we should keep on moving further away and not to stay in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">All through the night...we shouldn't run away there...the LIthuanians were shooting in the <span class="DLF">sky</span> with...with guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">It was like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">battle zone</span> in order for us...to keep us scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Now in the middle of the night without our knowledge....we didn't know that, they start pulling out people already, and putting them in..in <span

class="sentence" id="887">So I'm thinking to myself:..the funny part was I never said I'm going...I never thought I'm going to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">All 3 years, I never thought
