QUESTION:  Tell me about your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Tell me about your parents and...
ANSWER:  Well, the parents were just hard-working people, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">They did...they are not...they were not doing very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">After war, uh, nobody really was doing well in in those small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I remember from my childhood, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> , when the mother would go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> to...to uh, to get uh soup which was which was uh distributed by the committee, Hoover Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So I remember vaguely this, this thing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">So uh, as I say, they were just...just hard-working people; and uh...and uh...uh really not excitement, not much excitement about what's...what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">But you know I was living close to the nature; and from the very, very beginning, I...I learned to love the nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I used to go with my sister out to pick up flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Early in the spring, to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> ; but always alone, with her, as a small kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And they was...they would let us go, and we would go very far. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And maybe this was a, this escapades were very important in my life; because later on when I became alone, when I lived alone, when I had to make a decisions, I was ready to make any kind of a decision, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Which I think I contributed to my survival a little bit, because you know I would, uh, be able to, to, uh, to move around very, uh, freely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Let's come back to you as a child a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Um, what kind of a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did you go to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  I went to a <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">This was uh this was boys and girls together, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Uh, big <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ...and uh, I only finished four classes; because from the fourth class I went to the <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span> , which was the, the...the...there were, you know, the Polish uh...uh <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were organized at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And I then attended eight classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Eight years of...eight years of the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32"><span class="BUILDING">High school</span> was a little bit different. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">It is, uh...<span class="BUILDING">high school</span> plus two years of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , uh--that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">When you graduate from that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you go straight to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And I did go the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , Jagie _onidw [Jagiellonian] University in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , where I, uh, studied, uh, history of art. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And this made me, you know, got interested in the art itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So I joined...so I enrolled into the <span class="BUILDING">art school</span> , Academy of Fine Arts, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> ; and I finished that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in 1939, just in time before the, uh, war broke out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  What was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> like in those years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="40"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> was a, uh, a very beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live in, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">In those days, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Surrounded with so many landmarks and beautiful <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43"><span class="BUILDING">Jewish synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">We used to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We had a...in, in, in uh, uh...I had to, I had to attend also the classes, you know, in the art...the <span class="BUILDING">art school</span> , the history of art classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Now the professor was Franz Klein. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">He's a Jew, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">There were a lot of Jewish professors, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And he was, uh, very fond of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , and knew everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="50"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , it's a old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">In order to appreciate that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , you have to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> ; because in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> you see the whole history, how it developed. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">You see all the styles that, uh, are not visible <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So we went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">There is a...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , there is one <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> which was, uh, in...looks like a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , fourteenth-century <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">It's in gothic. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And it was donated to the Jewish community by the King Kazimierz Wielki, who brought the Jews to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , and settled down...uh, settled this community in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , uh, called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kazimierz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So, uh, uh...they had, you know, very much a part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> history; and they lived there 'til '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Now, I don't know what's happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">You know, I haven't been there. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">But I understand, you know, there are no Jews, not many left. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So, so apparently this uh whole section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> have changed, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  Did...as the war approached, did you have Jewish friends as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  Oh, in my class, in our <span class="BUILDING">art school</span> , I had...you know, there were several Jews, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I might even later on remember names, uh....
QUESTION:  That's OK.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  This is...this was international, I would say, group of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">There was a woman, she was Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">There was a uh...a Russian emigrée, a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">There were Ukrainians. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">There were Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">There were Jews; and there was even a French uh...uh, a French uh fellow, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So they're uh international in a group of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  As...what happened to this life when war broke out? </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Can you tell us what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  Completely changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Immediate changement. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">When I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , uh before the Germans occupied it, and I went ...uh, I traveled through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> eastwards ...uh, ahead of Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Because this was the order by the Polish military. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We hope that we'll be drafted, sooner or later, to the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And, of course, this never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So when I went too far--I went almost to the <span class="DLF">eastern border</span> --and I found out that it is the Russians who are now marching westwards, occupying that part; so I have to, you know, make quick decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And I chose rather to stay on the <span class="REGION">German side</span> , so I moved back and joined the Germans, you know (laughter). </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I crossed that <span class="REGION">territory</span> into...into the <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">But this was, this was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> looked completely different. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">First of all, the whole government of Generalgouvernement, moved into the...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> became this uh...capital of that uh province, uh so there were so many Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">The Germans uh were everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And then of course the persecutions started immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">All the professors at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> were arrested, and they were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">People in my age, again, were being arrested all the time and sent as forc...forced labor to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So I had to leave that uh...that uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and go back to uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> , where I found...uh, thought would be safer to live; but not because uh.... Again, I joined the underground uh organization; and, of course, because of that, you know, I was in in constant threat of being arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  How did you join and why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  There is by, you know, a few people knowing, you know; and they.... This...this was, you know, situation where you never know more than three people. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So you really, know, was given a job to do and this was in organizing--very early, 1939 still, and 1940 at the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So, uh, there was not, not much as the...the activity as more just the organizing uh process that we are involved, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Hiring more and more people, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">But this was from the very, very beginning uh ...in action. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">On account of that, and also because uh uh again the Germans were, you know, arresting young people and uh taking them to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camps</span> , I had to uh, uh...uh... stay in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I had to...I, I was not sleeping at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for, uh, for many months; because, you know, it was, uh, uh, not safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And out of that came the idea that I must go. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> , and go to another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ; and, uh, maybe again join the army in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , which was being uh...uh, organized at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Uh...so with three other people, uh, I...on...in March 1940, I uh... went through the Tatra Mountain[s] to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> ; and I traveled through the through the <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And I traveled almost to the other end of that little <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , almost to this <span class="DLF">Hungarian border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And here we...I, myself and another uh fellow, we were arrested; two survived and two escaped--but two of us were arrested, because we just, uh, ran into the uh...uh...set-up, you know, by the...by the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">They waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So, uh, they arrested us and then they sold us to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Slovaks sold us to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I mean, they...I understand that they were paying money, being paid money for that, you know; because they were, they...in other words, uh, they were, um, working as agents for the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">You know, Slovaks at that time were cooperating with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">There was a government run by that uh uh priest Haha [NB: reference to Joseph Tiso?]. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And uh... and, of course, they...they allowed German to...on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> come in to the trans...military transport to go right through <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So, uh, at the end, uh, they gathered us all arrestees--and there were thousands of people that were being arrested--uh, so about...a huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , a huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going toward the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And we crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muszyna</span> , where the Gestapo took it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And that is why I got in contact with the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And they were immediately, uh, segregating all those uh, arrested...arrestees. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Uh, I tried to...I, first of all, I...made up a, uh...false name; and I stick with that false name all the time, because I was ashamed to let my parents know that I allowed myself to be arrested. (</span><span class="sentence" id="122">Laughter). </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And so I stuck to that, uh, false name; and, of course, everything, all the personal data and everything uh, uh...was changed to and also falsified... falsified. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And I figured that it would be good idea to uh to to be born in <span class="REGION">Soviet territory</span> , because I was hoping, "Well, the Germans will never get there." (</span><span class="sentence" id="126">Laughter) How wrong I was! (</span><span class="sentence" id="127">Laughter) So I uh...I gave all the data and places in the in the <span class="REGION">territory</span> which was at that time occupied by <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> ...

<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  When I got off, no...before...when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped, I saw on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> a <span class="DLF">line</span> of soldiers, uh, with machine guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">On the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> in the fenced-in area in that real <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> I saw people in striped uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">They looked like, uh...uh hospital patients. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">These were those thirty Kapos who were brought from uh...they... from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">They looked so innocent, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Not... they looked just like a, like a patient; but when the <span class="DLF">doors</span> opened in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...these are the people who, you know, attacked us with the...with clubs, with, uh.... These was the soldiers' helpers; and we already know really, you know, we're in huge trouble from the very beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">There was not time to grab the, uh, suitcases and all our belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">We all just had to jump, uh, from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ; and right away, you know, uh, we are in, uh... beaten and kicked and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And this way we marched to the, uh, <span class="NPIP">inside</span> ; and they right away, uh, uh...made a column of us, and were, uh...we were, uh, processed. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">That means we have to be, you know, the...the...the data, the personal data, was, uh, was written under; and then they...then they shave our heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">They gave us number. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">My number was 564. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And, uh, immediately they started a gymnastic with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">There was nothing else to do; so, so they says that first an gymnastic, uh, the German call it Huipfenrollen, all kinds of, uh, terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I remember a beautiful grass around that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ; but in few hours, there was no grass at all, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">In the next few days, it was really uh necessary to go and find something to do other than gymnastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">You know, a real work, even a hard work. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And, uh, I was assigned to a group that was going to a military compound, uh, nearby to clean uh uh the rubble which was...uh, they partially destroyed this whole <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And in a week or two, we moved over there to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> consisting of three blocks in one corner of that compound. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And this was the beginning of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Out of that, uh, <span class="REGION">area</span> we would then go out and build first of all a kit...a <span class="INT_SPACE">prison's kitchen</span> , and then surround the whole <span class="REGION">area</span> --which was twenty- one, uh, brick blocks--with uh barbed wire, electrified barbed...uh, barb...<span class="DLF">barbed wire fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And immediately after uh after this was accomplished, this...the new transport start arriving. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And there are transport who had come from <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ; and uh from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And ...and uh to the end of that year, to the first winter, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was probably about uh, uh fifteen thousand people strong, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Immediately, Germans began uh to...uh enlarge the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> by building new <span class="DLF">blocks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">They built another eight <span class="DLF">blocks</span> ; and uh so the...so the thirty, thirty-nine <span class="DLF">blocks</span> was the end of the...of the whole construction in that <span class="REGION">area</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  Tell me more about what your...what a day was like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="207">From the morning 'til night. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">What was a day like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  Well, we would get up very early, even before the sun... sunrise. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And immediately...and eat and get a uh uh substance that was called "coffee," which was made out of the bark uh of a...some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I mean, it was bitter but it was black, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And it was bitter, and...that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Now 1f you have saved uh some bread from the day before, then you're lucky and you'll eat that uh that piece bread before going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">But if not, then you just drank that coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And then immediately you were thrown out. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Regardless of weather, you thrown out uh...<span class="NPIP">outside</span> and you'd have to stay and wait for a roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">The reason being that people, uh those who are um... who are um...who are uh assigned to do the cleaning would uh clean up the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> where we slept; and they themselves would then join us and go to work with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And certain hour after, uh we would all assemble and there was a roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">A roll call uh is the...1t is a ceremony that the Germans never stopped uh doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">It was uh at certain times uh three roll calls a day; in the morning, in the uh at noon, and in the evening--and later on, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">But not less than two. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And after roll call--if everything was OK, if there was nobody missing, you...you...all the dead from the night before were counted.... And they were, have to be counted because at night the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> , <span class="BUILDING">German offices</span> , were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So if anybody died, you would be counted as alive until the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> opened so he could be uh crossed out in the big book and say that he is uh...he 1s dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So anyway this was...if everything accomplished, and uh and nobody, as I say, was missing, then you would join the groups, working groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So the people would go, you know; some would go to the uh...uh to...with the wheel-barrows and uh spades, you know, to do the work on improving the <span class="DLF">roads</span> or to the agriculture or, you know, or to the so-called "Bauhof" [Ger: "<span class="DLF">building yard</span> "], where all the professionals were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Uh, uh...all the skills like uh...uh masons and uh...and uh carpenters. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">There was a, also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , a group of uh sculptors from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zakopane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">They would do this...they would, they would create the plates for SS; and, you know, the ashtrays--all kinds of things made of wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">So I, I even work with them for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Also there was another jobs, very important; of course, in...1n uh <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I work, my first work was in uh...an <span class="BUILDING">architect's office</span> ; and uh I was assigned to do the renderings, color renderings, of uh projects that were in...in uh...on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawing table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Uh, all these drawings will then, will go with the plans to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> for approval. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Everything has to be proved; approved in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I also had a secondary responsibility uh...in that <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">I would help the surveying team. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">From the very beginning, uh, the surveying team would go in the terrain and do a uh...work on the map. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And they were really hurrying; the German wanted it, that map, because the uh <span class="REGION">area</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was being depopulated, the vill...villages destroyed, people taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Uh so, uh that any terrain would have to be measured...uh all the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and all the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> or everything, and sent; because on it, that basic map, they would do the planning what's going to be there in the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">On one (cough)...one area of that uh big territory there, the camp on...later on they built a huge compound "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> ," which is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brzezinka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">In Polish, it's called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brzezinka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">In German, they call it "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Uh, this is where later on, in 1940, would be start the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">So, uh, until the evening we would do all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Uh, all of this outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp;</span> uh, so we would go in the extra guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Extra guards--there are large <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Uh, they would set out some...1941, some hundred guardsmen, and they would join--few of them with every group--and go and stay the whole day. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Again in the evening we would all return. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And, uh...uh on the average day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> there were always orchestra playing, and uh the people would return and form like a small parade. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">With the tools in the hands that they used during the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">They would march to German tangos and (laughter) and uh...military songs; and this was must. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And to attention, of course, while the commandant and all the SS would watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And you have to do, uh, march very briskly, like uh...like a soldiers; because the German, they like make of us soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Uh, to a point, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And then of course we would assemble on the <span class="BUILDING">roll call place</span> , and there would be the roll call again. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">If the roll call was successful--nobody had escaped--uh, then we would go, and we would get your our uh...our uh supper. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">If there was a situation what somebody escaped, then instead of going to the <span class="BUILDING">Block</span> , we would wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And, uh, meantime the search party would go out and search for, uh...for a man who has escaped; and the search party would be, uh, composed of the soldiers and the Kapos, uh, from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So there would be about three hundred, four hundred people going around and looking for, uh...for an escapee. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Usually it was not, uh...it was almost impossible to leave entirely the area of the...where, where the during the day the guards were stationed; because, uh, it is always, uh, open...that <span class="REGION">area</span> was open...and there was no, uh, no <span class="NPIP">places</span> , no...no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> , no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , nothing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">So app...usually an escapee would have to know, uh, have to, uh, get the hiding somewhere in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in that <span class="REGION">area</span> outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and then wait for a night to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">So that is why most of those who escaped, uh, usually were found. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Now if a man was found, then he would go to a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> for a while, true uh...uh. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And he would be asked question: why he did it, how he did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Gestapo were interested in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And then on the next day or day after, he, uh...he would be paraded through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ; and then, uh, on the, uh, roll call, uh, ceremony he would be hang on the gallows. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And this was a regular punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">If a...1f this was not the case, then we would go just simply to the <span class="DLF">blocks</span> and get our soup and bread and margarine, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And it was all kinds of, uh, uh...and this diet was, uh, usually a watered soup and a slice of bread, and a little bit of of margarine. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">That's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And then after that, uh, there was about one hour of daylight; so in this time you would have to repair your uniform, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Under the supervision of Blockaltester, who was the...the manager of the <span class="BUILDING">Block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And what is the <span class="BUILDING">Block</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="274"><span class="BUILDING">Block</span> was a, uh, a number of people who lived on...in...on one <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Blocks, uh, <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , were two-story <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> ; and that means in every <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , uh, would be two blocks, uh...because there were two different <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Sometimes even on, uh, in, uh, on <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> they would form another <span class="BUILDING">Block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And generally was not more...not enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> more for some hundred and fifty men. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">But I remember times when there were up to one thousand people in every <span class="BUILDING">Block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , we would sleep six of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So there was actu...actually no sleep; we were just sitting, you know, the whole night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  When did things begin to change in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="282">When did you get the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">ANSWER:  The <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , uh, was in, uh, in 1941 established. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">The idea was, uh, uh, came from the, uh, comman...the camp manager. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">His name is, uh, Fritzch, Commandant Fritzch.' </span><span class="sentence" id="286">He created two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="287"><span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> and the orchestra, symphony orchestra. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Uh, symphony orchestra was, uh...uh, very large. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">It was opera...uh, run professionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">It was so good that they would, uh, allow her to go to the neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and have a concert, for Germans, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> , in...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bytom</span> , even in...in...11 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wroc_aw</span> [Ger: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Now, <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> was beginning, uh, from, started from small beginnings that Franz Targosz was the manager of that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And his, uh, function was to go and look, and...and, uh, confiscate a more interesting items that the people used to bring when they come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ; so in <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> were things like, uh, national flags, uh, military, uh...uh, orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">You know, there were Jewi...Jewish bibles. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">There were, uh, there were, uh, folklore uniforms, all kinds of, uh, maps, all...this kind of things, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And there were...now, the reason why the German, uh, allowed this--uh, and they even, the German even allow a big <span class="REGION">area</span> for that at certain point. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Because they were always expecting a International Red ' SS Hauptsturmftihrer Karl Fritzch, deputy to Rudolph Hiss at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">KL Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">KL Flossenburg</span> in January 1942. * </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Franciszek Targosz, prisoner no. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">7626, persuaded the SS to set up the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> and organized a Kommando of painters, sculptors, jewelers and watchmakers for that purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">See Garli_ ski, Fighting Auschwitz, pp. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">89-90. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Cross, uh, visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">So if this would occur, then they would have a, uh, opportunity to tell, "Look, and...you know, the prisoners here are uh doing alright, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">They are living, they are...you know, they are having even a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> !" </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And things of that sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">In the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> there were, uh, several people working--or employed--were, you know, to send, that, uh, were sportsmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I, I mentioned before [Czerk (ph)|. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">He was one of the...of the steady people working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">He was painting on glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">There were two Jew, Jewish fellows who were translating with the bible. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">It was also Fritzch's idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">He wanted to have a bible, uh, translated from, uh, Hebrew to German; so there was a, uh, uh, older man. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Uh, he was a rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And he knew the bible, and he was translating into Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And there was another, uh, friend of his who translated it from Polish to German. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Now in four years, I understand they translated two pages. (</span><span class="sentence" id="318">Laughter) And they both survived, because the Germans just simply have forgotten about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">This is something that happens very often in, in, in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp--</span> that, you know, once you establish yourself then they will forget about you. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And then you are on your own. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">It is up to you, to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">That means you have, you have a...you, you learn the...you learn the tricks how to not be beaten, how to, uh, stay in hiding if it's necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And, of course, there was always a time, uh, an opportunity, to get an extra food, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And this was also important. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So those two fellows, you know, survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">You know, with all this Holocaust, they...nobody bothered them. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And of...and it goes for other people, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Those who are chosen when the transport came, and they were chosen to go as prisoners--I mean to be uniformed as prisoners and go to for work...they usually, uh, survived, most of them, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Unless they were either, you know, run into the trouble, uh, with the...with the Kapos, with, uh, Blockaltesters, or they got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">A lot of people, uh, died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , unfortunately; because of the, uh, uh...like uh...there was a typhus, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="331">The typhus killed thousands of thousands of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Another way to die in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was to go and be executed, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">The Gestapo always uh, you know, was the final judge and, uh, on the fate of a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And they would...and they sometimes wait a long time before they, uh, would, uh, send a man for execution. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Sometimes I know people who, some who survived two years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp;</span> and then they were executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Uh, and they were never told for what-- for why, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">The execution was taking place in <span class="BUILDING">Block 11</span> , uh, on the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> between <span class="BUILDING">Block 12</span> and <span class="BUILDING">Block 11</span> , and that <span class="DLF">execution wall</span> still standing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> today. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And uh...at the beginning, uh, execution was performed by a platoon of soldiers, uh, with, uh, with rifles; and it was very noisy. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">People in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> knew about it, that something's going on in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp;</span> uh, because there was that salvo. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">So later on the Germans changed the whole, uh, occurrence. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">They would, uh...they would use a silencer; and one man would execute a, uh... the prisoners by pointing to the neck, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And, uh, I remember, uh, I know the man who was executioner. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">He was, uh, a top sergeant. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Uh, his name was, uh, Palitzsch.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="345">He was a twenty-nine year old man. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">He had a family and four children. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">But at the end, he fell in love with Jewish woman; and he was sent, uh, to the > §s Hauptscharfuhrer Gerhard Aro Max Palitzsch. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Employed as  Rapportftihrer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">KL Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and to the <span class="REGION">east front</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Nobody knows what's happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">But these men, these men had certain...in 1942, executed in one afternoon three hundred people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">QUESTION:  Did you see it, and can you tell us about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">ANSWER:  I didn't see the...the action; but I saw the corpses being driven on the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and the...with the blood running to the <span class="DLF">street</span> , as they were uh...uh...on their way to <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">This we saw, all...all of us, because you know, we were waiting for a roll call at that time when they were going right through, to the main <span class="DLF">gate</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Now, uh, this three hundred people, this was a transport that was arrested in 1942 in a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Uh, mostly artists and actors and uh...and uh, teachers (cough); and they were brought, uh, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">O_wi_cim</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And they, uh, were assigned the works; but only they work about two weeks, and they were all called up--their numbers called up--on the roll call, and, uh, assembled in, uh, <span class="BUILDING">Block 11</span> and shot, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">QUESTION:  You survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">One of the ways you survived was by contact through the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Can you tell us what you did, and how you did things in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> --what your contact was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">ANSWER:  I, uh...no, well I really can...uh, my contacts were actually uh with the surveying team-- earlier, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="363"><span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> is something that you do in your spare time. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Uh, I was always working. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">I really never worked in the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> as such; but I did lot of work over there and a lot of paintings that are still there, because it was a meeting place uh for many artists. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">There were about five hundred artists that I know in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So uh many of them...there was even a hard <span class="NPIP">place</span> , a hard time to get a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stand in the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> and do some work. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">But, uh, the contact with the civilian were done uh...uh, when the...we would go, allowed to go and out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> as a surveying team. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Because automatically we had to have a contact with people, because we were going into the <span class="REGION">areas</span> which was uh in process of depopulation and there were always few people still left uh wait...waiting to be transported somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">So that is how all the contacts grew up with the families and underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And, uh, as you...when we were about to escape we had a very good contact with underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And there was a plan drawn how; and where this will occur and in what time, on what <span class="NPIP">day</span> , and who's going to be waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And it worked the same way as was planned, after many months of uh missed opportunities and, you know, in uh disappointments; because you...you...you never are sure, you know, if you really succeeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">But uh....
QUESTION:  Tell us how you...how did you plan it, and who did you plan the escape with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">ANSWER:  I was planning with another man whose uh name is on that picture, Kuczbara [NB: identified on the photograph as "Bolos_aw Kuczbara"|. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Sometime, some day, as we were * See Garli_ski, Fighting Auschwitz, pp. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">285-287. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">walking--at that time I was working in a different uh job. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">I was uh in "Arbeitseinsatz" [NB: "Special Work"], which is uh a uh <span class="BUILDING">labor relation office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And uh as we were wal...returning to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> one day, we just talked about it; and we found out that each one of us is...has a false name. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And uh...and we came to the idea that this is a a good...that is a...the next step would be...uh, should be an escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And, of course, he told me that he's a Polish general's son, and that he goes to the certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and listens to the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">He has a communication with it.... I don't know if this is uh true, because he was this kind of a fellow who imagined a lot of things; but anyway he was always very active. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So, we had in our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> a uh a sergeant, German sergeant--uh, blinded on one eye--older man, who was a teacher before; and he was the manager of that <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="386">He was...he had a apparently large family, and he was always in the need of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">He was worrying so much about that uh family of his, so that Kuczbara-- who...you know, who knew almost everybody, uh...especially in in uh...in the area of...in the hospital area.... Because he also was a dentist--although he told me he never was a dentist--but he was pulling the teeth in...he, he he was acting as a dentist in...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="388">So he knew a lot of people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And, see...so, uh, that...that German uh asked him for money, and he want us bring several hundred dollars...uh, marks, German marks. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">But there was this...there was a prob... there was a stipulation that we would have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to get this money; because it is our family that will bring that money, you know, and hide in certain <span class="REGION">area</span> near...near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And if we go there and we find money, he'll get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Now this was a plan of escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">We were supposed to escape from that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">He'll get that money; but we will, we will escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And there was a idea that uh we will give him something to drink.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">QUESTION:  Give who something to drink?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">ANSWER:  A whiskey with a uh with uh...with sleeping pills in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">But what's happened: he didn't drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">He was not drinker, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">This was one of uh thousands of soldiers who didn't use any (laughter).... So it, 1t didn't work, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="402">We have to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">There were several other ways we tried to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Never work. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And finally we came on idea that we will never do it unless one will uh be dressed as a soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And we started organize a German uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">This took, took months. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And uh...uh I, my job was to furnish...to give him all the documents the sol...the German soldiers uh usually carried in the wallet. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And, uh of course, the main thing was to...to make that main, most important uh document where he needs a photograph. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">So, again, Kuczbara uh found...uh found...in his, in his bag on his arrival he apparently brought, you know, some pictures of his. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">See he went there and he found that uh, that one picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">He gave it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">I painted a uniform on that pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">We sent out then later on that photograph to the underground in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and they made a copy out of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And the copy came back, and here was Kuczbara in the SS uniform. (</span><span class="sentence" id="416">Laughter) Yeah! </span><span class="sentence" id="417">So we used this uh...that photograph on that document; and uh, of course, other documents--that was, everything that a soldier should have in his wallet, he [NB: Kuczbara] had. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Now there was a question of a revolver. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Now, the revolver uh...we took from the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> uh where we worked, because we saw a Sol...a SS man locking a revolver in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> while uh on the weekend he was going to the Catholics. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">So uh we broke into that uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and took the revolver. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">So we had a revolver. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Now, two other people joined us. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Uh number two, who is that Kussel; and...and uh Januszewzki, who was also at "Arbeitsdienst." </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And these, we...people, we took because they were...they had a way of uh organizing almost anything in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">So what happened: Kissel went to a SS man in agriculture, and uh uh tried to uh loan from him a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and two horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And for these, he offered him the...uh two...uh some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> .... I, I forgot, you know, what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Anyway, uh the uh SS needed something for furnishing his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And, of course, if he would go, you know, straight away through a sign...through a signing the papers and the...and ordering this--you know, in official way--would take a month, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">But here he come, he got in uh contact with the prisoner, and prisoner could do this immediately; because in everywhere in all these <span class="NPIP">places</span> ...uh <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> , there were always prisoners who worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">So this way we got the uniform; because, you know, it was the prisoners who work over there, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And you know, you give prisoner uh some margarine or, you know, you do him a favor. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And uh we were very important agency, because we could uh gave a man a good job uh for this, for...for...for uh giving that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">We would, you know, have another favor from, from other people...
QUESTION:  At this point I need to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">We need to change tapes...

<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">You had uh arranged for the uniform?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">QUESTION:  Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">What happened then? </span><span class="sentence" id="443">If you could just repeat, you know, after the uniform?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">ANSWER:  Well, we waited for a word from the outside people where, when the escape will occur. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">When, and what time. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And uh we were given four days. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">We couldn't go...there was a plan for four days. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Uh, we couldn't go in the first day because first day was a Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">The second day was a very bad weather after Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">So at the end, it was on 29 of December that in the morning we decided that we're going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And it happened this way: I went uh...Kuczbara and myself, we went to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on usual schedule; and then went out of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> with the papers to, into...into the <span class="REGION">area</span> where uh the people, usually new people, usually used to come and wait, you know, to...for, uh uh... in...interrogation, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">That was our job. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Two other people--uh Otto [Kussel] and uh Januszewzki-- they were uh the "Arbeitsdienst"; they had to uh send out all the columns out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And then they would come to our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and have to write a uh a report. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Every morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">This I have to emphasize, how...how this uh uh the pro...procedure in, in our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Every morning, they had to write a report on how the employment of the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> looks like--where, how many they were uh... there were people employed in what categories of jobs, how many there are sick, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Now these reports written on a special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> , big one; was then be taken by a messenger--a soldier--who traveled to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienburg</span> every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="459"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienburg</span> was a uh headquarters of the labor, of all the labor assignments in the...in, in the...1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in the whole <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And uh on that particular day, 29 of December, they had to do that in order to be free. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">After that they could do whatever they wanted because, you know, they were not [Czerk (ph)]. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">You know, they would uh they would visit uh various uh working groups in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , or in the uh uh <span class="REGION">area</span> inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="463">So Otto went to that SS man, who...uh and he got from him a pair of horses and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> ; and drove this, this uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> through a main <span class="DLF">gate</span> , to <span class="BUILDING">Block 24</span> where we all lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And he grabbed four or five prisoners who were wandering in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and made them go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> ; and from the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> they brought down four uh cabin[et]s, wooden cabin[et]s. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">They loaded it on the, on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> --which was a platform--and he drove out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> again, went to that SS man he was dealing with, gave him two cabin[et]s for...for just uh making that deal; and with two uh... two cabi...<span class="INT_SPACE">cabinets</span> on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> uh he would uh ride to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where, in between, Kuczbara would dress into the uniform, SS uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Uh, and...and I was with him; and we were waiting for ...for those two to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">We took from our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> about sixteen thousand names, files uh of people, uh of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> were completely annihilated. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">You know, we took this as a...as a sample what is going on in our...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Also, we took a list of uh people who were executed in uh...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> --on the Block 1 1--with the signature of the, the top uh doctor, SS doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Uh, he had to countersign them, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">So we had, you know, some twenty-four thousands of names that we took with us in our briefcases. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And when the Otto and Januszewzki arrived with that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , we jumped on and we uh drove off to the main <span class="DLF">gate</span> , again. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And at 11 o'clock, uh we drove through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">The soldier opened the <span class="DLF">barrier</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Uh Kuczbara told him, "Heil, Hitler!" </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And that's it, and this was the end. (</span><span class="sentence" id="478">Laughter) Because we were posing as a working group. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">We had a...these uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">This was supposed to mean that we are, you know, delivering a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">SS house</span> somewhere in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">So nobody bothers us.

<p><span class="sentence" id="633">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I was...this is always...that, uh, play a very important role, uh, in protecting my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">I was always able to utilize this, uh, for some, someway. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So I painted landscape mostly, and portraits; and, of course, by working in that, uh, <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , I was, uh, assigned to a map that was hanging--huge, uh, war map--hanging in the <span class="BUILDING">commandant's office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And on it, I had to, uh, write in gothic, uh, characters all the data concerning that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">So to the very end I had to do it, even when...when we all were already locked up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">There was no work. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">They still were calling my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I would have to go to the <span class="BUILDING">commandant's office</span> and change that map on a given day. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Therefore, I knew completely everything what is going on, all the secrets. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Uh, how the front, where the front is, how many people they...they have lost from that, from that crew of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was taken over, which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was lost, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">So uh...and later on, I fig...I discovered that...that this was a very dangerous job that I was doing; because usually people who knew so much they would eliminate, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I even didn't realize...uh, realize at that moment that I... would be on that list, but I probably was on that list. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Only through a very lucky circumstances I got mixed up with new, uh, crowd somewhere in, uh, along the way, and that is why I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I also mentioned, uh, that story, that part about GroB Rosen, about being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with all the soccer teams. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">There were fourteen soccer teams, all uniformed. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And they would all play on Sunday, a games from the six o'clock in the morning to...to the end of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And, uh, the beginning of it would be a parade, which would.... I mean, the commandant would stay and ...and, you know, accept the parade. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">First was always a, a, uh, band walking in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Then would be some comics, you know...we had some comics, you know, entertainers. (</span><span class="sentence" id="655">Laughter) Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">In every camp entertainers had, you know, a chance to survive, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Uh, sportsmen, boxers, uh, soccer players, of course, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">So then later on, all those teams would be marching; and two first teams would start playing, and they...when they finish, there will be another. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And it was for championship, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">But Gro Rosen was all...not always only soccer, because in GroB Rosen I saw hang peo...uh, six people hung [hanged] on one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gallow</span> and I saw a lot of people being hanged for committing a sort of sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">When we...yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And also on ...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gro} Rosen</span> --before the evacuation, all the sick people in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was, uh, put aside; and later on they were all eliminated, because they didn't want to take, uh...to the evacuation, uh, program include all those sick people. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">So it was a, a, uh, a very murderous game too, you know, although it looks so nice, uh, uh...on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you want to add about Gro Rosen before we move on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">ANSWER:  Well I could add only this: that the Germans, uh, ordered the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> be burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">As soon as we left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the group of Kapos that, uh, remained, you know, put fire to all the <span class="DLF">blocks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">All the <span class="DLF">blocks</span> were wooden <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="668">So today nothing left; only foundation and only the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> --uh, one <span class="BUILDING">brick building</span> , the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp--</span> which 1s still standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Everything else was completely destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">There is absolutely no proof that there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">QUESTION:  Tell us what happened to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Where did you go? </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Where were you taken when you left Gro Rosen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="674">ANSWER:  I was, uh, taken by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to the next...to the...to the camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hersbruck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hersbruck</span> was a sub-camp of the big camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And, uh, again, in, uh...I landed 1n, uh...in <span class="BUILDING">office</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I had al...yeah...I had the same; and this...this job, uh, I knew, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">They always appreciate people who know, are familiar on the job, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Germans are very practical people. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">They might be very cruel, and they might...but you know, they are practical; and for, uh, for, uh, for this practical purpose they would use that man to, you know, to the very end. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Uh, I was, uh, getting a good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">As I watched what the other doing, the whole transport that came from...from, uh, Gro Rosen were, uh, detailed to the work in the underground factory, uh, in the hills around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hersbruck</span> ; and to clearing the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , uh, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> [Ger: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nurnberg</span> ] after the, uh, air raids. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So, uh, part went here and part went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And of course, you know, this was a murderous, uh, uh, assignment. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">There were a lot of people who died because, uh, the situation, the living conditions was at that time already disintegrating. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">The...so, was so primitive that, uh, even the strongest people have a hard time to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I would, I would not dwell more on that, uh...on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hersbruck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="688"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hersbruck</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> uh, built on the <span class="DLF">swamp</span> , right by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">We had to walk on, uh, on the, on the raised uh walks that was raised about three feet above the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">All of the <span class="DLF">blocks</span> were built the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">They were raised, because there were water underneath; and of course this is being a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">sub-camp</span> , they didn't care about, you know, routine...regular, uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> routine. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">There were no roll calls anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">The roll calls were performed, uh, uh...privately, on each <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="694">The main thing was to do the work, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And the most important work for them was to work...uh, clear the destruction caused by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> on the main <span class="BUILDING">station</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I went there several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And I remember the first time we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , which is about twenty-six kilometers from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hersbruck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="698">It took us six hours 'til we arrived in, uh...in the <span class="BUILDING">Nuremberg station</span> ; because, you know, all the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> were, uh, uh, in...completely destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">So uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hersbruck</span> was a target of the constant attacks by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">The situation was such that there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hersbruck</span> , and a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in a valley-- narrow valley--and there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> on both sides. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And you would see those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> coming from one side of the <span class="DLF">hill</span> and then disappearing on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> ; and they would throw bombs, everything what they had, in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And they were... and they were throwing bombs everywhere, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="703">They were attacking all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> ...uh, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that were approaching that <span class="BUILDING">station</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hersbruck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Uh, sometimes the bodies would...uh, would land right in the center of the...of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> after... after they'd attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">So we were always, you know, under attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">But on uh second day, day after Easter, we all gather in the, uh (cough)...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp;</span> and then we started the evacuation. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">There were ten thousand people that marched that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">We came after twenty days of the death march uh...through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , only less than than two thousand men. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Everything was...everything was killed or died out of hunger uh in, in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Five days we didn't get anything to eat or to drink at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Uh we were, we... we came as a ghost, really, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="712">And then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , nobody wanted to take care of us because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> itself was already in the process of evacuation. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">There were thousands of prisoners coming out of...uh coming into and out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="714">So uh when they finally process us, they didn't give anything to wear. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">We were naked, and we were only wrapped in a...in a blanket; and this way I lived several weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">It had a uh some advantages, because I didn't attend, didn't have to attend uh roll calls; and I didn't have to go to work because I didn't have anything to wear. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And this way I came, I uh uh...waited to the ...to the day--you know, 29 of April--when uh the...the uh final liberation came. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">It uh, days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> were uh really quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">You...uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was not working. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Only the essential things were in operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Otherwise the pri...prisoners were 1n the <span class="DLF">blocks</span> , and there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> above <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> all the time uh patrolling. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Nobody was shooting at those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> ; although there were thousands of SS in, at that time, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Everybody was uh uh very down. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Even the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">The SS would not even go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And there were no roll calls of any, uh, no...this famous drills that usually, you know, taken were were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="727">You know, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And uh, on the day of, uh, the, uh, liberation, the day looks even clo...more quieter than usually. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">But after noon, they order us into the <span class="DLF">blocks</span> and they lock all the <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="730">They locked the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , and the only people allowed <span class="NPIP">outside</span> were the, uh, fire, uh, uh, brigade made of, uh, SS and now of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kapos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And then we were receiving our supper, which is around five o'clock, a...an attack started, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">A hugh, uh, uh...I mean it's, uh...you heard, you know, the guns and you heard the revolvers and you heard, you know, all...all the front, all the all the fighting, you know, that is. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And it lasted about, uh, twenty minutes, and then came the silence; and in those twenty minutes we all grabbed our things and we were ready to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Nobody know where, but we were ready to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">But then there 1s a silence; and everybody paused and waited and...and thought, "Well, what's going to happen now?" </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And then I look in the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , and I see thousands of people running towards the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , towards the electric wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I jumped myself from the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and I ran and I come to the, uh, uh, the <span class="DLF">barbed wire fence</span> and I see everything is pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Prisoners are shooting from the rifles, you know, to the <span class="DLF">air</span> ; and everybody enjoy. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">You know, and I saw first American soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And this is how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And, uh... in <span class="NPIP">Heaven</span> are, uh, hundreds of, uh, various flags, national flags were flying over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="742">LONG PAUSE
QUESTION:  How long did you stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> after liberation? </span><span class="sentence" id="743">What did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="744">How did they take care of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">ANSWER:  They didn't take care at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">I mean, they...we were... the only...the, uh, man responsible for us in the <span class="BUILDING">Block</span> --because we were in, uh...1n an <span class="REGION">area</span> where, which was behind the barbed wire too--was a, uh, Blockaltester, who was a prisoner himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And he didn't know really nothing, what's going to happen, just like we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">As I say, it was such a disorder everywhere that uh there was no work. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">There was no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">We were almost as hungry as during the, uh...this march from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hersbruck</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And there're some women over there--behind in the next <span class="DLF">block</span> --too, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">There were just a miserable creatures. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">They brought ...you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was not known of having a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women camp</span> , but they were brought from somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Probably a, a, a group that was traveling on foot and uh came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> as the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="755">From there, they were sending people toward, uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Garmisch-Partenkirchen</span> [NB: Sub-camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">You know, toward the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Now, uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was, uh, liberated on 29th of April. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">The same day--at night--on orders by Himmler, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was supposed to be burned to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and everybody killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And there were special positions of, for additional machine guns everywhere between the guards; and, uh, uh...the Americans really came about one hour before the deadline. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">They also had to fight after having liber...liberated us, hav...have to-- at night, because a division of SS was marching from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="761"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> is about 14 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And they were kept from coming and, uh, taking over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> only by American guards that first night. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">But we couldn't sleep, and there was all that for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">We were supposed to be, you know, sent out not from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> in case of emergency; but the emergency did not materialize.</span></p>
