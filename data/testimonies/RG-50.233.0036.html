QUESTION:  So there wouldn’t be any resistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">ANSWER:  And another thing that they ask me many times, well how come you didn’t fight back? </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Jews were such law abiding citizens that not only that, but 1f somebody would have found it was against the law to have a gun in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">So, you know, Jews just didn’t keep guns in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I spoke in front of officers, Navy officers, and that was their first question and I understood what they were saying, it’s just that I don’t know if I could have given them a sufficient enough answer of the situation that was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">When you don’t have a gun and you don’t have the manpower anymore, how can you fight? </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Then nobody really knew that you’re going to a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , it was a big secret.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="349">QUESTION:  Uh, huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">ANSWER:  But, I’ll tell you, the way they dealt, we should have known something is horribly wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">The way they dealt with a human being, if they wanted to make us work, you don’t go and beat someone to death or beat someone half dead, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">It was, you know, we weren’t dealt like we were human.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Well, also again they didn’t keep us long in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> either because it was like, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I think they knew when we were there that the war, now looking back on it they didn’t keep us long in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> either. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">But, the <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> , they emptied out a <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> , it was big. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> or <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> , so we brought some blankets with us, you know we carried certain things and they gave us a little place there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where we stayed, where we had our little <span class="NPIP">place</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Then they gave us rations, soup, you know, in the morning coffee, and at night soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Of course the <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> were horrible, there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to wash and the kids, there were no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So, it was a horrible situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And the worst of all, we didn’t know what would happen next. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">All we saw is that every day they brought in more Jews, more Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">We just didn’t know what they were going to do with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">QUESTION:  How long did you stay there, do you remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Not very long?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">ANSWER:  probably months, just maybe, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Maybe a month or two at the most. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">From what I remember, it wasn’t, you know like the Polish Jews were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> for years, but this wasn’t a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">The Polish Jews were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">This was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">QUESTION:  This was more like, maybe a transit point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">ANSWER:  Yeah, they got us together and shipped us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Because at that time already they had the capacity, you see with the Polish Jews they didn’t probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">They didn’t have the capacity of destroying that many, so they had to kill them by bullets. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">So, you know, it was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">But with us, they could gas thousands of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">QUESTION:  So, let’s see, you were there for a month maybe two months?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  Months, I would say months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  Somewhere in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Now, would this be in °43 or still in °42 or right around ---

<p><span class="sentence" id="387">QUESTION:  Uh, huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">12
ANSWER:  And then, I’Il tell you, when I think back on that ride, you know they put so many people into that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">We had no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> , small kids, sick people, they just packed us in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">You know, if they would have taken us to work someplace they wouldn’t have done to us what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Just even the transport, that in itself should have said something to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">But we couldn’t imagine, we couldn’t imagine that we’re going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">We couldn’t imagine that.</span></p>
