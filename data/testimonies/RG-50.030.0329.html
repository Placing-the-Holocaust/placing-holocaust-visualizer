<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  I want you to start by telling me your name at the time and now at the present, your date of birth and where you were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name was Bylash Sharf. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born in East , March 22, 1929.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your family and your life before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  We were three sisters and a mother and a grandma, and we lived a fairly normal life, a happy life. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Then when the war broke out, I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in 1939, and in 1940, they started to talk that I wouldn't be able to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">This for me was the biggest blow, because when September came and I looked out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I saw my friends are going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I had to remain <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , this was a big pain for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I could not understand as a little girl why this is happening, and everybody was worrying and there was such a panic and everybody was uncomfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Everybody was fearing, and they were talking that we should run away to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and to leave everything behind and my mother said, how can I leave here. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I have the children and the family and whatever I worked all my life for and to run away to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and we didn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  Let me ask you a little bit more about . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">How large a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> it was, what was the size of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">It was a poor little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">There were a lot of -- there was a trade like <span class="BUILDING">markets</span> , they were on certain days, and there were <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">People going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the daily life, but there were a lot of poor people. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">We considered ourselves better off. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We had an uncle in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and he was sending us money and mother took pretty good care of us that we were well dressed and she emphasized that we go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and to be educated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Were there a lot of Jewish people in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Mostly Jewish people, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I think the population was around 2,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">There were <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Just about the normal Jewish life what it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  And your family was traditionally religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  They were religious, but not too religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">We observed the holidays, and I was raised as a Jewish child, but I was going to -- I didn't go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , so I was mixing a lot with Polish children, and I spoke only Polish at that time, and I was a blonde little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I think that because of being blonde, and I realized that being blonde and speaking well Polish at that time, that I had hoped that this will be an issue that I will be able to survive among other children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  Did you feel a difference when you were a little kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Did you feel that the Polish children didn't like Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Yes, I felt even before the war started, so when you were crossing from one end to the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , or you went out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , someplace with your parent, you were always called "dirty Jew," "dirty Jewish little girl, or you should go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , you shouldn't stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> why are there so many Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="31">This I experienced since I was able to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Did you make sense of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  This is how it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">This is how it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">It came to a point that when we started to grow up and live a little better, so we had to hide if the Christian children didn't have as much as we had, we had to hide certain things like baked goodies or something like this, not to show off.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  But you had Christian friends from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Yes, I did have Christian friends, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  Did your mother work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  We had a little <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> , so my mother had this and we had about three acres of <span class="REGION">land</span> , and somebody took care of the <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">We also had a little <span class="BUILDING">windmill</span> that it was making flour, you know, so she was constantly busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I suppose when my father died and when my grandfather died, my grandma came to live with us and she was the primary person that took care of us, and mother was the breadwinner.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  And your sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  And my sisters, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  You have a twin sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  I have a twin sister and one almost two years older than I.
QUESTION:  You were fairly young, but do you remember were there 01:07 political organizations, Zionist groups or anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Yes, they were, but I didn't belong. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I guess I was too young at the time to belong to those organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  Were you aware of what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after Hitler came to power or were you too young?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  When the war broke out people started to talk what was going on in German that Hitler came to power and he wants to -- not to kill the Jews that the Jews had to flee <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or that they were not able to be educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">We started to read about and hear those stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  What is your memory of the beginning of the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Did the Germans come into your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  The first, the beginning of the war we were bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">There were three bombs that came down on that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and some of my relatives were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">This was the first initial fear that I experienced.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  This was when?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  September?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  Maybe it was the end of September or October. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I don't recall which month it was, but some of the relatives were killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  We didn't do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">We went out with our lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  Now, did things start changing all of a sudden. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Were there decrees or restrictions on you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  I recall that in 1940 -- as I said before Jewish children were not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But I think the teacher -- not the teacher, he was in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">He liked us so much and we were very good students and he kind of overlooked this particular year 1940 and allowed us to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">But by 1941, we couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  What else couldn't you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  We were not allowed to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and people were just running and bringing in food, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Initially people were gathering in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and just listening what to do and how to go on with life. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I had the grandma and I think there was 01:10 an uncle that had two sons, and the parents were taken away and the two sons came to live with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I asked my mother and my two sisters, we asked should we run away to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to hide someplace and the grandma was ready to go with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">She was about 74 years old but she had from her son the other two children and she said where will I leave them. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So, she remained. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">She remained and at that moment when we were ready to leave the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> for a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> they started shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So, we run away quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We didn't know where we were running, but we run into a neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> that my mother was dealing with some of the people and we went into hiding into <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">They took us into <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> and we couldn't go out during the day, only at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">We were there for quite a while and we were going from one family to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">They took us for a while and then they said we cannot hold you because at that time, it came out a decree that if the polish people will hold Jews, they will be killed themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Or they gave them a prize, like five pounds of sugar to give out the Jewish person or the Jewish family. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So, they were not able, even my mother's best friends, they said you know I would like to help you maybe by yourself but not with a whole family and you have to leave my <span class="REGION">premises</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So we were wandering from one family to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">This was going on maybe more than a year that we were wandering from one family to another and this is how we lived, 01:12 and then one day my mother went into a family that she was very poor and approximately her children were our age. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">How my mother came to the thought to buy or to offer her money she should go to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and to take out some kind of documents that we should leave the place where we were born or the surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> that they knew us, and she said she dressed us 1n very long dresses and scarves over the heads and we started to look like 15, 16 year old girls and at that time the Germans were catching people to go to work to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">You know we were working around the Germans, the Gestapo and nobody caught us. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Nobody caught us and we were like disappointed. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So, at one point my mother said she took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , she brought the kids for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I want to stop you a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I have some questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So, you were hiding out in these <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> and <span class="DLF">fields</span> and did you have to pay these people something to keep you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Those were the people that they really tried to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They knew my mother very well and they respected her because there were times when they needed help my mother was always there to help them because we were a little bit better financially off than them. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So, but there came a time when the rulings of the Germans was so that they were afraid for their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">They were also afraid for their lives and of course they were ones -- I think once I remember that they caught my mother some <span class="NPIP">place</span> and 01:14 they took away a ring from her and they said if she doesn't give the ring they will bring her to the Gestapo or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">This was the people that she was raised with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Some were very vicious and some tried to be very helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  What was their reaction towards the Germans and the Nazis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  They liked them. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">The Germans -- in the beginning they brought in a certain prosperity. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">You know they were wheeling and dealing and selling things, I don't recall what kind of merchandise but there was a certain prosperity that arrived with the Germans at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">The Polish population, they I would say that they were silently working together with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">They were indifferent to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">They wanted to get rid of these Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="109"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> had three million Jews before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">This was the largest Jewish population in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and the Polish people were 75 percent illiterate at that time and the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> had the big influence morally, politically whatnot and they knew, they were told that the Jews killed Jesus and the Jews are non desired to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So, like the rest of the world, they tried to overlook that you are human beings and when you are a Jew you 01:16 have no right to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">There were very few of them, that they were real Catholics, and they really suffered from this point, that the people are getting killed like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Your mother bought these birth certificates or identity --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  She got them from these other children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  From the family the peasants that were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">She went to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and she took out a birth certificate for both of us and from her she took her birth certificate from her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">My name at that time was Bronislava Bershenska.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  And your older sister was with you also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  The older sister got the birth certificate from another family and her certificate was altered slightly, but she was traveling with this birth certificate, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  And these birth certificates said that you were catholic?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  That I am a Catholic, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">That I am a catholic, so where were we.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  I have just one more question for you and you were going to tell me that you went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">As a young girl was -- at this time was there a sense of adventure about this, or was it frightening, do you remember’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  Ninety percent was fear, but there was maybe ten percent of adventure. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I think in moment of fear you cannot appreciate life at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">You were trying to run from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another, just to survive, just to sleep over the night, just for another day and to hope that someday this will end.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  Now, your mother's plan was to then go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  It wasn't her plan to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">She wanted to run away from the <span class="REGION">territories</span> that we were known, or maybe we could be recognized. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So, we went and we bought tickets, she bought tickets for all of us and we went on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">There was a lot of people that they were smuggling like food and other articles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , the food probably mostly, and she started to talk to somebody on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and she gave an address to a German Volksdeutsche, that they needed help for their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">The Volksdeutsche, either she was a Volksdeutsche or he, so they had certain privileges by the German government they received all kinds of goodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I don't know if they received any money, but they were especially elite like, and they started to hire help. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So, my mother was hired in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I don't know where we slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">We probably got up and got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> at night or in the morning and she got this particular address from the other women. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">She was a Volksdeutsche, and he had a wife and four children and she was pregnant with the fifth and she needed help. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So, he hired my mother right away with my twin sister and this lady directed me to my family also a Volksdeutsch family that at the time I think I was approaching 14 already. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">This was in 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">She hired me to be with her children I should go to <span class="DLF">park</span> and to play with children or go with children and do for the children things. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So, my main job was to help a little in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I did some marketing and basically to play with the children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Where did they think you came from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  We told them that we run away from the territory of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , that the Germans chased us out and they took away our possessions and they called us Fluechtlinge (refugees), we (were) chased out 01:21 from our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And as I said, I emphasized that to speak very well Polish and to be from a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , we thought we maybe assimilated as other Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">In other words, our Polish language was so good that we could pass by that nobody should have a hint that we were Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  So, this was in 1943 when you got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  We arrived I believe in late 1942 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">It was around November, in the fall, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> started to burn the next year, in 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So, I was at that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I was going for walks with the children and I have seen Jews going from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> like hundred Jews together. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">They were -- their clothes were torn. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">They had the yellow swastikas (means stars of David) on them and they were going from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I don't know where they were going, but I stopped and I looked at them and it inserted in me such a pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">In a way I was happy that I wasn't one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I could have been there among them, but the pain was unbearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I turned away and I cried that nobody should see me that I was in such pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">When I was in this family, I think this was my mother's teaching that we should all go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So, I asked the family where is the nearest <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and I took the children every Sunday, and I dressed them and I went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> every Sunday with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Around -- and this is how we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">My sister had an incident the older one she was walking in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and a woman from our <span class="NPIP">place</span> recognized her and she started to call her. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So, she run away and we were told that. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So, there was a period of time when we were afraid to walk the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , you know, how big is whole <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">There may be some people coming shopping and being on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , somebody can recognize. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So every moment, every step that you did, you had a certain fear in yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">There was a fear of being recognized. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">At one point, my family, the husband of the wife brought up a girl and she had a document, she had dark hair, she looked like a typical Jewish girl, and he started to interrogate her and she had the paper and the seal was like of a penny, or a dime, and he started to question her and he took her away to the Gestapo, and he interrogated her in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">You can imagine how I felt at that time when he interrogated the girl and he did bring her to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">But life was going on until about July when all of a sudden two Gestapos showed up in the 01:25 <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and they said to my lady, to the wife of this man, you have here "ein Juedisches Kind", you have a Jewess here. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">She looked at him, I have a Jewish girl here? </span><span class="sentence" id="173">This is not possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And she opened the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and she showed him Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">She said, Hitler is my god. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">How would I be able to hold a Jewish girl in my <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">She denied it, and I will never forget this. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I was peeling potatoes at that time, and I became almost stiff, and he was talking to her that this young girl has a mother with another girl, and so she started to swear to them that it's not possible that she's Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Either her mother or the other sister is Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">She will swear by that. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So, he said tell her and he spoke to me German but I stood with the back, not to understand from Jewish to German is very easily to be understood and I pretended I don't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">So, she told me in Polish that I should get dressed and I should go to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I had no other choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">It was July. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">It was hot, whatever I took and the two Gendarmes took me down to the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I was going over to my mother and the fear in my mind what my mother will see if she will see me with the two Gendarmes going there. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">But while 01:27: I was walking with them one to the other said, "Ich glaube nicht dass das ist ein Juedisches Kind", in German he said I don't believe that this 1s a Jewish child and this give me such a strength that I recovered myself of the initial fear and when I walked into my mother, my mother saw me, I saw my mother is pale and 1s dropping like she's falling and my sister and they start to talk to this man at the time, this wife of his just gave birth to the fifth child, and he happens to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the husband and he was a high official in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">He was an SS man, you know, he was working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Allee Sucha</span> (??). </span><span class="sentence" id="188"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Allee Sucha</span> was like they would arrest in a <span class="BUILDING">criminal court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Once you go in there, forget about it, nobody comes out. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So, his wife started to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">She said how can I be left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">She gave birth and on top of it she was very ill I think she had a lung infection, pneumonia, and she was about to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I think she eventually did. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And he said to the Germans, to the two SS people, you know, I'll go with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I can swear by God that they are not Jewish people, but I'll go with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And he emphasized also that they are going to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with my children and he would never allow himself to lose his high position that the was a high ranking man and to hold Jewish people in his <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">He dressed himself and he went with us to <span class="BUILDING">Allee Shukha</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">When I arrived there I did not know my older sister was already there. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">What happened with my older sister, she said that she's from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> some <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but she had beautiful underwear and she wore glasses and this woman that she worked for, she said, you know, you don't look like a peasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">You look like you come from a learned family and you wear glasses. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Tell me, I think you are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So, my sister didn't say yes or no, but she started to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">As soon as she started to 01:30: cry, they arrested her. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">They also took two Germans and they also brought her to <span class="BUILDING">Allee Shukha</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">When we came there I saw her in a different <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with two Germans and I and my mother they took us by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I looked at my mother, and I knew that within a couple of hours we will be dead, that we are already in the hands of the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">When we arrived there, they started to ask us about religion, if I know the religion the prayers, so I knew the prayers by heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">We were prepared for that, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">QUESTION:  Catholic prayers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  Yes, catholic prayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">So, one came out to me and he said in German, tell me you are really a Jewish girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">You pretend to be a catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I think he started to speak to me in Polish because when they spoke to me German, to us in German in general, we didn't answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">We were standing like dummies. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So, when the same SS man started to speak Polish I told him, you know, if you will persecute us, do away with us, you will have on your conscience, innocent children. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">That's what I answered him. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">I was only 14 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I stepped forward and I started to speak to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">That man that my mother was working for, he also started to tell that this is not possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">He was arguing with them and give them all the details about us. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">So, they asked my mother, they said they will make a deal with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">That they will allow us to leave this <span class="NPIP">place</span> for three weeks and bring my mother's marriage certificate, the death certificate of the 01:32: father, the other documents which I needed, you know, and at that time in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> I think I already had a Kennkarte and an Arbeitskarte, you know, so they released us, and I came back to the same family. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">She was glad to see me back, so did the husband of the sick woman glad to see mother back, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And my older sister had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go because this woman that called the SS didn't want her anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So, she was a couple days with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I went down and bought a paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Imagine that at 14 years old, and looking for a job outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">So, there was a farmer that wanted help, so we put my sister on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and with the address of that farmer, and my younger sister went with her there and she remained over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And the younger sister came back and within those three weeks that we were supposed to deliver all the papers and identify ourselves, we started to plan to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">There was no other choice, just to leave the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">As ill as she was, my mother's lady, she was a very fine woman, but I guess survival is over taken everything and you run like animals at that time, and we started to make plans that one day 01:34: we will meet at the main <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and again to go into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> or maybe we will ask somebody where we will be able to work, or maybe we'll go to the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span> and maybe we will be across the <span class="DLF">border</span> to go to Russian that we shouldn't be under the German occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">QUESTION:  Before you go any further, I want to ask you a couple more questions about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  Yes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION:  You said that you walked this <span class="DLF">park</span> and you saw the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and people coming from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , did you have any contact with those people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">QUESTION:  When the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> Ghetto uprising took place in April of '43, what did you see, what were people talking about on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">ANSWER:  The Jews are burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">The Jews are burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">The feathers were flying all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , -- feathers, smoke, a smell. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">We knew that the Jews are burning in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">But I couldn't do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I had no contact, and I would be afraid frankly to go over and to look. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I knew I would lose my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">We were hiding away, but at the same time, this time I think already we knew and the papers were writing that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> has fallen. </span><span class="sentence" id="245"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> has fallen and the Germans are receding back. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">That they didn't succeed to take <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">The Germans - when I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , the Germans had black flags. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">When they lost <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> they put out that this was the saddest day for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">The military people were writing articles that this is the worst day for them, that they lost <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Privately everybody knew that once they lost <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> and they started around back, that they would lose the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And everybody hoped that there would come a day that we will be liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And you only lived with one thought in mind, to live one day longer than Hitler, and then to die.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  So you had a lot of access to what the German people, or the Polish people were thinking on the other side of the <span class="DLF">wall</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  Yes, I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">QUESTION:  Anything else you can remember in terms of their attitude? </span><span class="sentence" id="256">They didn't care whether the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> is burning or did they talk about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">ANSWER:  You see, I was with that Volksdeutsche family. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">They were against Polish people and they were against Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I was too young I guess to go into politics with adults and I tried to avoid even to have friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I started to develop a young little lady and boys started to try to talk to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I was bowing my head and I walked away. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I was afraid to talk to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So, I was too afraid to talk to anybody except what I was reading in the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I was very much interested in what is going on in the world, and I bought the Polish papers which I was able to read and whatever I could make out as a 14 years old and to understand what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">QUESTION:  So, you had information on the war and what was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  Yes, cover to end, prior that I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , the Russians were bombarding already <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So, even that I knew that the bomb may hit, the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> that I was sitting, I was going down with the children to those <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> , you know, against the bombs, I was happy that the Russians are flying in the <span class="DLF">air</span> over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and they are trying to fight the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  Your family had a private <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  In each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at that time had a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">They had <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> , 01:39: yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">So, they were like sirens, everybody was running to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">In my heart, I was very happy that even if I get killed that I knew it was a Russian bomb, not a German bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I would think it was rather that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  How much contact did you have with your mother and your sisters while you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER:  Maybe twice a week, we met in the <span class="DLF">parks</span> and we talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">We talked only on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> about private matters about running away or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Mother always said not to give way that we should hold up and maybe in the near future the war will end and we will survive the war and this was our daily hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">QUESTION:  It must have been comforting that your mother was nearby?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">ANSWER:  Of course, by myself it would be much harder.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">QUESTION:  You don't think your family ever suspected?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">ANSWER:  The family of me, that Iam a Jewish child? </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I think at one time she said that I have a Jewish head on my shoulders. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So, let me continue with what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I saw that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was burning and we had to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">We went on the main <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and we bought tickets and we were going further. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">We were traveling about eight hours by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">The older sister was already sent away to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , so we knew where she is but where we were going to be she wouldn't know, but we said that we will get in touch with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">We were traveling about eight hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">We were already tired and exhausted and on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> they said it's not possible to in Russian the <span class="DLF">border</span> , it's not feasible because if they catch you on the <span class="DLF">border</span> right away they will destroy us. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So, we came off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and we went to a family and asked for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">They gave us food and they asked who we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">At that time I think I told you I had an Arbeitskarte, I was no more a Jewish girl and my mother also had this document and I felt a little more secure with this document. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">She wouldn't let us to sleep in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">We had to go to a superior of this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to allow us to sleep there, and we went there in person and we presented our documentation what we had and he gave us permission to remain in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So, the first thing they said, could you work for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I said yes, I can remain. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I said what will be with my mother with my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">She said, stay a week with us and we will find her something. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">So, I think I am talking about myself a lot, but this is true. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I was going for the water, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> they didn't have yet water at that time in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> so they had the <span class="DLF">wells</span> , and somebody was passing by and I walked over and I said do you know somebody need help. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">My mother is looking for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">She said yes, there is a man that took over like a 40 or 50 acres of <span class="REGION">land</span> and he needs some help in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Do you think your mother would be willing to go there to take this job. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I said yes, just give me the address. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So, she gave me the address and the next day my mother and my sister went the eight kilometer, which was about four miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">He was a single man. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">He had a lot of step. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">It was I don't know how you should call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">He was in charge of a large 01:44: piece of <span class="REGION">land</span> , a big landowner. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">When my mother went there, he hired her right away, so she packed the little stuff that she had and she went away and I was very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I remained with this family for about another two, three weeks and they came an order from the Germans that from each family somebody has to go to work in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> or somebody to collect potatoes or other -- you know you take down from the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I don't know how to express myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And I went to work and they put a sack of potatoes on my back and I fell right away, and I saw that I couldn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I said I cannot go to work anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">So, they gave me some other work, you know, in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> a little <span class="DLF">fields</span> , and I went with a cow here and there, and I said I cannot stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I have to go closer to where my mother is. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">So, I went around four kilometers and I was looking around, and I came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">It was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and it's called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sokolov</span> ?</span><span class="sentence" id="321">Polaski. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">It wasn't far away from this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and I went to a little <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and I said do you have some work for me? </span><span class="sentence" id="323">She said what can you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I said I can help you with whatever you like. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I will do anything you will ask me to. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So, she was having like a little <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> , you know, and she was using me to bring in food or a 01:46: little whiskey or something to carry into that little <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and to help to serve the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">So, I was there, and the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was like about two miles away from her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">She took me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she didn't pay me, but I had food and I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">She was also a woman by herself and she had an adopted daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">She was also slaughtering pigs and making delis and she was selling that. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">She took me to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> to buy pigs and I fell right into this family and I was doing everything together. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">We went together to buy those pigs for the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> and the illegal whiskey she was buying and selling and she was making a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">The whole <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> was there and I felt I am very secure there. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">She also had some a cow and some other things that had to be looked after and I did all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">At one point, she said to me, you know you really have a Jewish head on her shoulder. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">When she told me that, I almost died <span class="NPIP">inside</span> myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">This was around December, the holidays came over and I had to look that everything I should do correctly when the holiday are there, and behave like a real Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">QUESTION:  A Jewish head, what did she mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">ANSWER:  I was too smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I was so smart that I am thinking like a 01:48: real Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So, she said this Easter you will go with me to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and you will do the confession in front of a priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">When she told me that I almost died <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I said how will I be able to do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I was hiding someplace in the corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">I said the prayer, whatever I said, nobody was listening to me if I said correctly or not, and here I will have to stand in front of a priest and to say all those prayers, and she was standing right behind my back. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I kneeled down -- again, I brought myself the catechism, this is a religious book, and there was no electricity and I bought candles, and where I took the money from the candles I don't recall, and at night I was learning the catechism from the beginning to the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And I must say I had a terrific head. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I had a good memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I don't know if this was out of necessity or I was young or I was brilliant, and I knew all those prayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">So, the holidays came closer and I prepared myself like every night and when she went to sleep I put on the candle and I was studying and I went in front of the priest and I kneeled down and I said you have to unburden yourself with all the sins that you committed during the year, and I was I think past 14 at that time, and I really was an innocent child, what could I have sinned. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">You know what I told the priest? </span><span class="sentence" id="353">That I was saying bad things about my mother which wasn't true, but I had nothing else to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">He looked at me and he saw such a young face and he gave me a prayer 30 times to say I should cleanse myself with those prayers and I went to the corner of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and I said all the prayers, and I came out of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and I was very, very relieved. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Believe me, since then she never said that I had a Jewish head on my shoulders. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">This was around Easter time. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I think around end of June I started to see Russian soldiers coming in, and they said that the Germans are running away already from the <span class="REGION">territories</span> that I was there, but I couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">They were dirty, they were torn. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">The uniforms that they wore they looked like they run away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">It didn't look to me like military people. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I was sitting quiet but I was running over to my mother and I said you know I think the Germans are going. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">We have already the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">She said be quiet and sit still and don't talk to nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">We have to see and wait what will go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Then in August I don't know if I heard from people or papers, I saw that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> is already free. </span><span class="sentence" id="366"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> is freed by the Russian people. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I went again to tell my mother this news, and she started -- I started to feel like you know she was stepping on me and I was doing a lot of chores and no matter what I did when she was killing a pig she needed maybe 50 pails of water and I had to carry it by myself and I just felt the evenings that I couldn't do this any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">She started to get very rude and I had the sense of feeling that I was already liberated in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">The Russians are here already why should I perform such work and she doesn't deserve it. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">So, | went to my mother and I told her that I'm going to leave this lady because she became unbearable to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">She said sit another couple of months and we'll see what will 01:53 develop. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">But I packed myself up. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I can only tell you that I had only one pair of shoes and one little underwear, my whole thing was a little package, and I took this package one day and I said to mother I arrived at <span class="NPIP">mother's place</span> and said you can kill me here. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I am not going back to that woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">She's a real witch, and I don't want to suffer any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">My clothes started to fall apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">You know as you grow you start to expand so I started to get holes in my clothes and she wouldn't buy me nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">There was a certain resentment and anger, so I was working only for the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">But really the liberation and knowing that the Germans are going, I wanted to see what will be next. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And when I said to my mother that even if she'll kill me, I'm not going back to the woman, she had no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">So, she said okay you will sleep here. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">The next day I walked out into the <span class="DLF">garden</span> and there were a lot of -- at this Volksdeutsch, the man that my mother worked for, he run away already. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">There was no supervision over nobody, over the food that they have grown it was just like everybody lived by themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I met a man, listen to that, and he was an adult, I was at the time already close to 15, and he took me aside in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> and he said I suspect that you are a Jewish girl and your mother too, with the other sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I can tell you that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> there is already the Jewish committee from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> that they came and they established, and you are too young to live here in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and you will ruin yourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> and there will be new hope for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I was afraid to tell my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I couldn't believe my ears what he told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I didn't know if he wants to convince me that you know that I'm Jewish that I should confess or he really wants to help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">So, I didn't tell my mother that this guy spoke to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">But I told my mother that I heard that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> there are Jews already, that they are congregating the old survivors are there, that they are running to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">So, she said let's sit another couple of 01:56: months. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Don't talk to nobody that you are Jewish and we'll see what will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">She was pulling time. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">She wanted to reassure herself that we shouldn't be too hasty to make a step forward that we shouldn't get lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">You know what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Once a Russian soldier spoke to me and I asked him if he can bring me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> and he said he's going in that direction> I was fearless, and I said I'll go and I'll take a look by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I went on a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">He didn't touch me, you know I didn't think of it that he will abuse me or rape me or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Somehow I was so innocent and I believed in the goodness of the people that they liberated me that he cannot do nothing wrong to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> and I go on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I looked at someone that look to me like a Jewish person and I asked him in Polish do you know where the Jewish Gemeinde is here? </span><span class="sentence" id="402">So, he asked you are you Amkho. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Amkho was Jewish code word for being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I couldn't answer him in the Jewish language because my tongue just couldn't speak any more Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I told him in Polish that yes I am a Jewish girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">That I am one of the survivors and I am looking for the Gemeinde. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">When I came there, they met me there and they tried to talk to me and I told them that I have a mother left near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sokolove</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Polaski, and he said that I should bring her here with my sister and they will be maybe able to give us

QUESTION:  So, you arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> and who are these people that you met?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  You know when we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , they had a place they called <span class="BUILDING">Dom Peretz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="411">A Peretz was a famous scholar [writer] or I think that was probably related with the history of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> before the war, so there was such a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> like an organization where they met. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">It was called <span class="BUILDING">Dom Peretza</span> , or the <span class="BUILDING">House of Peretz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">People went there daily to meet other people and to hear what is going on, just to communicate and how to live and how to organize our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">So, my mother met there people that she knew from before the war that they had already an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> there and they recommended a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on <span class="BUILDING">Lubartovska 18</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">02:03:
QUESTION:  I think we're skipping something. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">If I remember when we stopped before you were there by yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Your mother wasn't there yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">QUESTION:  And also, these people you met with, were they part of some international committee, the people in charge?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">ANSWER:  I don't know if they were international committee, probably some. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">The leaders were, but they started probably to employ people that survived or were capable or giving or lending help. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">They were partisans that had survived and I think that the Russians, the military was also involved to help the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I told you that I arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> by myself, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I went back, and it took me maybe four weeks to convince my mother she should come with me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Finally she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">So, she packed, not with everything, but she took a little belongings and you know what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="427">We went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I went down to ask really the directions is this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started to go and my mother went there and I remained on the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">So, I took the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and then I went to that Gemeinde, and I met my mother over there, and I think it was with my twin sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  And your other sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  I skipped this part. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">You see when we were liberated already and I ran away from that lady and I didn't want to work with her, so and we were talking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> so my mother took my twin sister and she bought her a ticket to go to the older sister where she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and this 1s for the first time that she knew that we were alive and that she is alive and she was there and we brought her to us where we were together where my mother was when everybody was running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I'm telling you there was food, plenty of everything because there was nobody to take charge so my mother was the whole housekeeper there. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">So, my sister came there too, and then all of us we proceeded to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">02:06:
QUESTION:  When you got <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , you found an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  Somebody recommended my mother found friends there from the prewar from a nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that they knew her that they already had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and they recommended. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">It was a two or three room apartment, but you know they, the committee, put in maybe ten people into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">There were four girls in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and the other ones were in the other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but it was fine as long as there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> to put our heads, we were happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">QUESTION:  Who were alot of these other Jewish people who were in this <span class="REGION">area</span> what were they like? </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Where had they been?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">ANSWER:  There were a lot from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">They came out from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , the partisans, a lot of them they came out and also from hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">My step father, that my mother married in 1945 he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> , in the uprising of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor [camp</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">You probably heard about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">He was one of the members that they tried to get rid of the Germans at that time and run away, but unfortunately about 600 people remained the people because the top people that were the guards, the top of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , they couldn't reach them and they had the ammunition they were shooting from there all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">So, they almost killed all the 600 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I think after the war from the 600 that were supposed to be liberated maybe 30 survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">QUESTION:  Were there any people there from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maidanek</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">ANSWER:  At that time, maybe not yet, not yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">You know when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> basically the people were there that survived the <span class="REGION">Polish territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="451">The partisans were hidden by the peasants or wherever. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">This was in 1944, but in 1945 when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> were liberated, I started to see those people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , those skeletons I started to see, and I just couldn't believe it that something like this exists because I was never exposed to something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  Hadn't you had any idea what was going on in other <span class="NPIP">parts</span> when you were in hiding? </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Did you know anything about what was happening to the Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">No, I didn't know about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I knew they were being killed, but how and what and I couldn't perceive in my head you know to understand that something like this existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">In fact, in 1983 I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and this was for the opening of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">There was a lot of Jews coming from all over the world and I went just to be there as a survivor -- I lost my thought -- and I went for the first time they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswiecim</span> , and they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , and all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">This 1s the first time that I had ever seen something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I have seen those glasses, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> and the shoes and all those clothes over there and the hair what I have seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I almost fainted. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I have never seen while I was living in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in the <span class="REGION">Polish territory</span> I was fortunate enough not to be exposed to those things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">QUESTION:  So, I'll let you continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">We're in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , you found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> with some other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">What was that like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  Well, we started to live rather well and together with a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">We were able I don't know how we got our food. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I think we got the help from that Jewish Gemeinde, and also my mother remarried in 1945 a man that she knew from before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">He was a landowner and he sold some of his <span class="REGION">land</span> and he started wheeling and dealing and he already was making business and there wasn't any lack of food or anything 1n the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Around February 1945 I started to inquire about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I went to the sixth grade in February and by June I had a certificate that I finished six classes of <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">With that in the fall I started to go to a higher education, a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">My mother wanted that we should go to a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">So, I needed seven classes of <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> to enter the second -- the second class of <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> and I didn't have this so I went to the Jewish Gemeinde and they gave me a paper that I finished seven classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">It wasn't real, but somehow I wanted just to be there for a higher education. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">But you know I was sitting and when they started to teach algebra and history and geography which was forbidden even in that time at <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> when I was in the fourth grade, I didn't have the slightest idea of what a map was looking and I didn't know what algebra meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I thought I was such a brilliant girl and all of a sudden I am standing in front of a professor and he's talking to me and explaining and I just couldn't follow. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">So, I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> crying and I said I am not going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I am not prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I'm not going to be a dummy there. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">She was a clever woman and she said we'll give you some help and she brought in help, tutors and I needed help in mathematics, this was a high education in mathematics already. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Of course in English, my English was not on level and other <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">So, for three months the tutors came in and helped me to the level that I was supposed to be, and after three months I had the exam in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I achieved the highest report card.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">QUESTION:  This was <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">ANSWER:  No, this was a general <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">But you know what happened later? </span><span class="sentence" id="488">The first month they selected me I should be the president of the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">The second month somehow they got to know that I was a Jewish girl, they took me away my position. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">They didn't like that and on top of it all we used to where a uniform, black uniforms and white collars and on the back they wrote you are a dirty Jewish girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">This was after the liberation in 1945 or maybe beginning of 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">In 1946 I don't know if you 02:15 remember a lot of Jews were returning from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> that run away from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and then they came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and those were the ones that were traveling by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> they were pulled down. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">There were two parties in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">It was Army of Krajowa (AK )and it was the communist the Army of KKR was against the communist and the Jews went with KKR. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">The working together against the German government and because of that the AK which was the army which was against the Jews, and they were pulling down, in 1946 they were pulling down the Jews from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and killing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">So, they started to get againt such anti semitism so some tried to run away, and at that time the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced camps</span> opened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> already and everybody was telling us that if you go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced camps</span> , you'll be able to immigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">This was everybody's dream, to run away to a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> not to be persecuted any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">So, one day I came back from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">This was again around Easter holidays and we had the Shochet, do you know Shochet, kill chickens for the holidays for the Jews to have kosher meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I come from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as a liberated, feeling liberated after such a war, you know surviving Hitler and all of a sudden in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallways</span> they are talking about the Jews killed a Polish child and there were about 200 people standing in that <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> entering that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I was living. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">When I heard that I said it's time to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">No more <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I have to get away from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Of course I knew already my husband, my future husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I was going out with that young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I think my older sister got engaged also to a man that he came from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> with the Sikorski Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Maybe you know about this that there was 02:18: Sikorsrki Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">He came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and he was in uniform as a military man and she got engaged to him and she left in February in 1946 to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Berlin</span> , and I wanted also to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I didn't want to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> especially after this incident when I came from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and they said that the Jews killed a Polish child for Matza. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">So, I made my business and I made up at that time to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Either my mother will allow me or not allow me to go, so I told my mother and she said of course I cannot go. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">I was only 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Yes I was 17 and she said you will go with that young man?

<p><span class="sentence" id="554">QUESTION:  Did you befriend any of these people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  Yes, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Some of them I befriended but my aim was to go to my sister where she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saltzheim</span> and she gave birth also to a child at that time and we wanted to be together so they saw to it that I should have a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">It was a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> like in each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was a family so I came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">We were there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzheim</span> about seven months and they discontinued this displaced -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="560">ANSWER:  We lived rather well. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">We didn't have good facilities, like one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was for every family. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">It was a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we took away from the Germans -- I don't know if they took away or the Germans left, what facilities we had one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> per family. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">There was also no water, no running water. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I think there was electricity, but in general it was not bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">We didn't have to pay rent and we had portions of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">We got some clothes, so as young people I think we accepted this is not bad at all, but let's wait until we get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="579">QUESTION:  None of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">This was far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I don't recall even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> when we arrived already everybody was a little bit on their feet and they started to live a more normal life that we started to go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I don't recall it no. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I was living among the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I started to speak fluently German and by the end, the last eight months I even hired help for my child because I really didn't know if I was raising him properly or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I did what nature told me to do, and when my husband started to deal a little more and he was selling those foods and we had a little more money, I hired -- she was a nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Actually she was a nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And at that time, I started to breath a little easier.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">QUESTION:  Your mother was still where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">ANSWER:  My mother came already. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">She left in 1948 and she came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and she was held over in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Supposedly she didn't know that those papers were illegal and they wanted them to return to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or there was at that time there was a quota to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">My mother had a brother here and her whole hope was to come here to see her brother but prior to her arrival he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">So, she was so disappointed that she wanted to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and the brother's children they tried to help her. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">They hired an attorney and she was sitting on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> for six weeks and she made a decision not to stay in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and not to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> but to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Actually, the attorneys I think advised her to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , that she will stay for a short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I think it was the attorney's decision that they should have them in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> they will be able to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in a very short time, but it took them two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">When they arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> the living condition was also very, very poor where in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> right after the war when my mother remarried that Mr. Mermelstein(?), </span><span class="sentence" id="599">he came from a very wealthy family and he sold off some <span class="REGION">land</span> so he considered himself a wealthy guy, and they lived rather well. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">In <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> they weren't allowed to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Immigrants weren't allowed to work and my mother was so proud that there were <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> that you could eat free food, so she went a couple times and when she got to know that this was charity she was starving to death and she wouldn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">She was a very proud woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">02:30
QUESTION:  What was your situation? </span><span class="sentence" id="604">How long did you stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt area</span> and how difficult was it for you to come over here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">ANSWER:  Well, we stayed there until we had the notices to come to the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> and prepare ourselves for the immigration to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I immigrated to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Our arrival was May 9 in 1950.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="608">QUESTION:  I want to back up a little bit because you spent several years pretending you weren't Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="609">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">QUESTION:  And you had to learn the catholic prayers but I'm sure there were other things that you had to do to make sure you weren't caught.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="611">ANSWER:  That I wasn't caught, I don't recall what other things I could do except to go to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and to act as a Christian, and you almost become a Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">You become -- you don't feel Jewish after a while, except mentally that I felt that I am Jewish, that I was born Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">But in my speech the knowledge of the Polish language was typical of a Polish little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">There were moments I'm sure that I forgot that I am a Jewish girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">QUESTION:  Were there things that you had to do so you wouldn't give yourself a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Were there ways you need to act or do things a certain way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  I was afraid to get close to a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I remember a young boy started to smile at me for instance, and he wanted just to talk to me and I run away from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I was running away from everybody that wanted to be close to me except my mother and my sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I was afraid to be close. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I shouldn't talk to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I shouldn't give away myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">So, I was always on the guard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">QUESTION:  Were there any customs that were different for catholics than Jews that you had to pay attention to, any lifestyle things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">ANSWER:  Life styles, I couldn't eat for instance a meal like pig meat, how you call it, pork, and the first time they gave me pork 02:33 with potatoes I couldn't tell them that I don't eat them, and I was hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">But when I ate it, I threw it up and I pretended to be ill at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I didn't tell them that I threw it up because it was pork. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">So, those were the things that in the beginning that it wasn't acceptable for me, but I had to hide my feelings, how I feel and not to give myself away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">QUESTION:  Was it important that you worked, you were just a kid basically?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">ANSWER:  I was a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">It was important, of course it helped me mentally to be with somebody, but there was a rule in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at that time that the Jewish family cannot live together. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">This was a rule that came out I believe in late 1941 that the Jewish family cannot -- they started to disperse and there was a time that you could stay with other Polish people but not as a family together. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">So, to work for somebody was a basic survival for food and <span class="BUILDING">lodging</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">This is the only way that I could survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I couldn't stay with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">I couldn't have my own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and I wasn't able to take care of myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I had to be with another family to -- this was only through my work and ability whatever I could do to help those families this capacity of course I wasn't paid much, almost nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">When they gave me a piece of clothes, I was very grateful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">QUESTION:  But you couldn't have stayed together as a Polish family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">ANSWER:  No, no this was too dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And where would my mother get the income? </span><span class="sentence" id="642">We lost our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the piece of <span class="REGION">land</span> -- we had about three acres of <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">We had like a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> and we had milk, you know we lost all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">This was taken away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">So, what were the other resources to survive, then to work or stay with other families.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">QUESTION:  Did you ever have a hiding place of something that in case you were caught you would go to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">ANSWER:  Prior that I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and we went on that journey to be caught as a Polish woman and to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> to travel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> we were hidden in <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> , in <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> the people 02:36 knew that we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">They brought us the food at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">You couldn't go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> the whole day. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">You had to wait until 1t got dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">So, this was the only times that we were hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Each time a couple of weeks with another family and this was going on for like a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">This was the most painful experience because the whole day you had to be hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Only at night could you be free to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> or something, whatever was necessary things to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">QUESTION:  But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , you didn't have an alternative plan or a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> or something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">QUESTION:  Did you know or were you aware of other Jewish people who were hiding out in the Polish side of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">ANSWER:  No, and frankly I didn't want to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I was afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I was afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">You know everybody became for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">I was concerned about my mother and my sisters but I was afraid to get in touch if somebody even looked like Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Not because I was hating the Jews, this was because of fear and -- of deep fear and suffering and not to be exposed to unpleasant things. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">In other words, if somebody was to identify me with a friend that is Jewish, they would automatically say why am I siding with the Jewish girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">So, if I am siding with a Jewish girl, I am Jewish also and my life was threatened. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">I was very much aware that I shouldn't get close to nobody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="667">QUESTION:  And you learned about the catholic religion largely on your own? </span><span class="sentence" id="668">02:38:
ANSWER:  On my own, and just by looking the way others did. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">How the children behaved, how the children of the people that I worked behaved, and I followed them or maybe I should use the word emulated them with great intensity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">QUESTION:  Did you resent being Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">ANSWER:  If I resented being Jewish, I don't know if I had the ability at that time to understand why I was born Jewish, but there were moments when I saw a cat or a dog and they were walking around freely, I envied them. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I really envied them. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I said why couldn't I be a cat. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Why couldn't I be a dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I should be able to move, but if I was angry with myself that I was born Jewish, I don't think that I understood at that time that this was part of history that I was born into. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I don't think that I could think rationally like that like I look back now at this. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">That this was the period of history that it's unfortunate for me that I had to be born at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">QUESTION:  But you would have felt safer if you were born catholic?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">ANSWER:  Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">QUESTION:  So, you must have wished that you were truly catholic girl?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">You know, when I was running at night from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another, and I saw those lights in the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and sometimes I heard laughter or talking in a normal way, family to family, I was so envious that those people lived normal and I run like a beaten up dog with constant fear with constant such heaviness in my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">How will I survive the next day or the next minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I was walking one night through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> to another family to convey something, and they stopped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">This was the police and they asked me immediately what is my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I told them Bernislava Bershenska and somehow they let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I was at that time afraid that this would be it. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">You know assume that I caught myself in such moments, I assumed that I will die very soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="689">QUESTION:  When you got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> and you could be open about who you were, what did that feel like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">ANSWER:  I think we were very happy that our wish came true, that we finally survived Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">You cannot imagine the wish of young and old that they wished to survive only one day after Hitler is gone and I can die in peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">This was the children spoke like that, the adults spoke like that and this was a sense of freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">A sense of freedom but also it brought our problems how to go on, what to do with this freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">How our lives should continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">What will be next. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">How to reconstruct a life. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">The people were basically they were happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">They were concentrating with each other and we all became survivors as a matter of fact we became like a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">They were all practically -- most of them they were young because old people couldn't survive and children couldn't survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">So, the young people they tried to get acquainted with one another to do things for one another to care for another. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">As a matter of fact, a girl knew a boy three weeks, this already was a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Let's get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Everybody was seeking somebody to be close to, to be together, to function as a human being again. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">A lot of people were looking for the families and they couldn't find. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">Like my husband arrived with his brother, he survived in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and he went to his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and he saw nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">He was very disappointed. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">He had I think three or four brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Nobody was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Not a sign of any life in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , so he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> at that time also.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="710">QUESTION:  Was it easy to get close to people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">ANSWER:  To our own survivors, yes, but not to others. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">As a matter of fact, to this day I don't know if you know about this but all our survivors they stick together. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">They do business together, they invited each other to all the Simchas or whatever was going on in our life as they would be asked in that family. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">This was 02:44 such an enormous bond of the survivors that you couldn't even get with the very educated people here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I came as a foreigner with a very little education, what kind of contact would a young lady for instance like you with a higher education, with a normal life span, how would you understand my feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">What I have been through. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I tell you something that I must emphasize. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">When my child was here about in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> six or seven years and I tried to learn about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and the history through the children, so I was volunteering to go wherever they went like a <span class="BUILDING">planetartum museum</span> something like that, and I dressed myself always very nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I was very presentable, but my English wasn't as good as they, so one day the teacher assigned me ten children to go to the <span class="BUILDING">planetarium</span> I believe it was, and there was one child that he was abnormal in growth and I took care of that child and I had additional nine children. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I was happy to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I remember there were like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">picnic tables</span> 02:46: on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and the one teacher came over to me and she said would you like to share with me her group of children and my group of children the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="722">So, I said with pleasure. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">As soon as I opened my mouth, she left me. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">She left me by myself with the ten children at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">There was plenty of <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for her too, with her group. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And I felt at that time that only because my English was so poor that she really probably didn't have pleasure to sit with me or talk to me about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">This pain I experienced and maybe I inflicted the pain by myself in my own mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I am not sure, but this is at the time how I felt and I must tell you I will never forget this experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">It was very, very painful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">QUESTION:  Did you eagerly embrace Judaism again or did you --
ANSWER:  My husband came from a Jewish family where he spoke only Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Instead of Polish or English I took over the Jewish language. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">We went on the high holidays we knew that we are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">We knew that the children were going to have to be bar mitzvahed. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">We sent them to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that they should have knowledge about Judaism but we should go every Saturday to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , we did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And we were injured 1n a certain way. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">We said we could survive a war like that and we saw small children being killed or heard about it, there is no God. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">But deep down in our roots and our minds we knew that we are Jewish that we have to have a sense of belonging that eventually it started with the children that the children grow up that we should send them to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> and they should be bar mitzvahed and they should continue a Jewish life. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">But we didn't emphasize too much on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I think when I look back now I should have done more. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">It wasn't so important to us at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And the excuse was -- the reasoning was at that time there is no God. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Where is God when you saw killings like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">If I didn't see it myself I saw it on the pictures or the pain that I have been through. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Why did I have to suffer so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Where was God to protect me and the most pious people that they were sent away or were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">So 02:49: there was a big controversy in our mind why we should be so devoted to religion when there was no God to help us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="747">QUESTION:  Do you think that even after 50 years there is still a lingering impact from these experiences? </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Can you talk about that a little?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">ANSWER:  Yes, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I lost my husband 23 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I succeeded in business, but I don't consider myself, I was pretty capable and very intelligent in certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> , but those fears, those nightmares, the life that we went through as a younger woman and coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and trying so very hard to establish ourselves and now as we grow older sometimes I feel that maybe it wasn't worth it. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Maybe it wasn't worth it. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">It's coming from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> said our generation is dying out now. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">We are living now in the time that we are getting older and all of my friends are much older than I. I was a child at that time, so you can imagine now I am 66 and my friends are over 70 so everybody is in pain and aching and complaining and life as you go along brings certain disappointments so every period has it's own how shall I express myself, every age has its own good and bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="756">QUESTION:  But how do you think that those years affected you in the long run?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">ANSWER:  The years and the experience in my life and the fear 1t made me more capable. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I am more self assured. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">I am more assertive person because of those experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">This was the lesson that I lived that you cannot be afraid to go on living. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">This is how I feel, but sometimes there are moments when you are thinking if it was worth it. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Of course I brought two children into the world, but I am also disappointed in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">I lost my husband 22 years ago and he left me with certain obligations and I did it quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I continued to go on living. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I get 1t done and I have very nice children, but it's not easy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">QUESTION:  There must have been some psychological impact of all of this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="767">ANSWER:  Yes, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">We are all very frightened people. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">In a way we are brave. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">There is one <span class="NPIP">side</span> that we are very brave. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">We think we can conquer everything and there's a certain amount of fear that we have in daily lives, which remains I think from childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Now that the population is aging you fear being alone, you fear getting ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">The structure of the family life in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> as you well know it's not the same as maybe in other cultures. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">The children go their separate ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="775">QUESTION:  Are these fears different than anyone else's? </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Those fears are similar to other people who didn't have your experience, don't you think? </span><span class="sentence" id="777">02:54:
ANSWER:  You see those people that they didn't have the experience, this frightening days and lost youth and not being educated, and trying so very hard, maybe they accept the life differently than I. You understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I went so much through, I survived so much, I remained a widow and I started to go on living and to go on in life and as you're starting to age, sometime I express myself that it was a false gain. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">That the whole life is a false game. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">I don't know if this is a healthy expression or a healthy outlook or not, but this is how I feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Because of this fear enormous fear that we live through and coming to a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> without education, without language without any profession and to try so hard and you run and you run and you try everything and then you say for what? </span><span class="sentence" id="782">I don't know if this is the approaching age that speaks of me or maybe the fear of what I have suffered so much didn't pay off enough for me you know because I didn't have a wholesome life since my husband passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">This is probably a combination of my feelings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="784">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you want to add that you think is important?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="785">ANSWER:  I think it's very important -- you know I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> this February, I attended the meeting of 3,000 people and I was so very proud of myself that I was among them. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">That the world and the history shouldn't forget not only us as survivors but also those six million innocent people that were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">It's very painful to read in the paper and this day and to hear that somebody can write a book and to deny our history what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">There is no humility in the human kind of something of this or people just want to get away from such times that we lived through which was so painful and people want to wash themselves clean and go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">I don't know if it's <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or maybe any other <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> they don't want to know about the Jews what happened and they want to forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And this 1s really painful to hear that. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">That we are living in such -- we achieve so much technique in our lives but the basic human animalistic things I think remains even now, the way it was 50 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">This is my opinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I don't know if I express myself right. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Do you understand what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="795">This is very painful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="796">QUESTION:  Anything else you want to say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="797">ANSWER:  I'm glad that you came to interview me, that maybe through this tape and my expression somebody will benefit by it and gain by it, but I don't with no one in the world to experience such fear and such pain as I have been through. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">This is all I have to say.
