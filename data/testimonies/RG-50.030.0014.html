<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  I was just four years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I don't — I just remember going downstairs and playing with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tricycle</span> on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">People weren't afraid of letting the children out alone, and I have only good memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I don't remember the other friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">It is a long time ago, but just pleasant memories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  What do you remember of when the Germans came?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  Well, I know that my uncle called up — my, my mother's brother called us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And he said, "Go downstairs on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and look up in the <span class="DLF">sky</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">The Germans are invading <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And I remember very — like it was yesterday going down with my father and my mother and my sister looking up and all of a sudden seeing <span class="DLF">sky</span> was full of black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">That was April 9, 1940 — 1940, April 9th, and the Germans were coming and — like a little kid was excitement. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I didn't realize what will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And the Danes fought for, I think, two hours and then they were occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">They were taken over. </span><span class="sentence" id="53"><span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> is a small <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  Was there any change in your life once the Germans occupied?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Not that I can remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="57"><span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> went on as usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Nothing happened to the Danes or the Jews and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was sort of a friendly takeover. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">The Danes cooperated. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">The police was still — I mean they hated the Germans, but they didn't, you know they didn't fight them because there was still Danish police stay — still stayed for few years. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And the government stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">It was really like sort of a benign takeover for a few years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  Did you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="64">By that time you would be six?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I went to first grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I went to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Carolineskolen, it was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I think I went to first grade and second grade before we fled.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  Tell me about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Tell me about that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">What was it like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  It was only Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">We were girls and boys in the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And I liked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">It was a nice <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I just, I just remember now that it was Chanukah time. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I remember learning the “Ma’oz Tzur”! </span><span class="sentence" id="79">in <span class="BUILDING">class</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And I remember just one instance that — you know, although we weren't religious, but it was still when you sat in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> in those days, you had to sit with your hands folded like when you were quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">But being it was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> and we shouldn't make a cross, 'Ma’oz Tzur Yeshu’ati [Stronghold and Rock of My Salvation] (Hebrew); popular Chanukah song. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">we Sat with our hands without, without folding them, like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">It was just a, a little memory, but it was interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I think it was from eight to two, like all other <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And I don't know if we learned Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="86"><span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> is really not a religious — even the Jews weren't religious in those days, but 1t was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I, I remember some of my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I remember one friend from the class kept saying — this was only in like 1941 or '42 — that she heard rumors that the Germans were going to do something to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">But that was like a year before it really happened that there were big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> waiting in the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> to take the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But we sort of didn't believe her. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">It proved to be right in the long run, but this was like a year before. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">One of my classmates—
QUESTION:  What was your impression, as a child, of the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Well, nothing at all oppressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I have no — we didn't know what was going on the world and the Germans did nothing to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">My father had an open <span class="BUILDING">store</span> with our name. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">My maiden name is Schenbaum, which is sort of Jewish or German. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And he had a, you know, <span class="BUILDING">store</span> with his name on and it was going on, and nothing at all happened to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">We went to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">All, all <span class="BUILDING">Christian schools</span> , whatever <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> , whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I mean maybe because I was so young. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Maybe my husband has different memories, but I don't remember anything negative at all about the occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  What did you and your friends do to play, say after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Did you go to ballet lessons? </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Did you take piano lessons?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  I did, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">But I don't know now if I am thinking if it was after we came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> or before. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">But I did a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I went to tap dancing, acrobatics — yes, acrobatics in Danish. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I took dancing lessons after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We went skiing. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">You know there are not that many <span class="DLF">hills</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , but we went with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We went to small <span class="DLF">hills</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I had a very good childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I played tennis. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">My father was an avid tennis player so we would always rent <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">beach</span> where there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tennis courts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And we always had a maid and I just remember everything as being very pleasant and nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Some of the memories are, I am sure, from when we came back, because you have to remember I was young when we fled.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  When did you get a sense of something changing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  Only the day we heard that we shouldn't go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  Tell me what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  Well, we were told, I think it came from the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , from the Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">He had heard that the Germans were going to round up the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">It was on a Friday night and we shouldn't — none of us should go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> or <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And I remember we had a maid and she just took care of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">She stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I remember, my father, mother, sister and I and an uncle who was married to a non-Jew, he also wanted to flee with us, and his wife stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> — stayed in their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because they wouldn't — they weren't going to touch, touch the non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So the five of us — I remember, I — we put on two, two dresses and a toothbrush in the pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">That's all we fled with. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And we went and.... Would you like to hear about how we fled? </span><span class="sentence" id="130">We went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">First — I remember — first, we knew it would cost to flee. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">We would have to pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">We knew that fisherman were going to charge about 2,000 crowns a head. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">That's what we were told. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So my father took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">On the same day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> he went to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> and he took money out and I remember he brought my mother also. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">We were told that we shouldn't take money to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> because we weren't going to use them. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And he bought a bracelet, as a matter of fact, for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And when I was 50, she sent me — she send it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And this is the one that she sent me. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And that is what he bought and I saw it had gotten smaller, narrower, but I thought maybe as a child I remember it as being bigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But now that my mother passed away two years ago and I inherit the other bracelet which is exactly the same, but just much wider. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I have that at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">But I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">He went to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> , took the money, bought bracelet for my mother and the rest of the money he took in his pocket to pay the fisherman. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And then he went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we all got dressed and like I said, we had two dresses on. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">It was October so I guess a coat you would wear. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Remember was two dresses instead of one. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And my father probably had two suits. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">That I don't remember, but my sister and I had two dresses on and a— we each had a toothbrush. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">We bought new toothbrushes and put in our pockets and then we went to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And strangely enough, nobody stopped us. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Not the Germans either. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I mean you could see people coming out on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and there was no, no, no—nobody stopped us and we went up from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Snekkersten</span> , which is a place that's closest at the seashore to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I mean, my father took care of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We were kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">What do you remember of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  I remember sitting there and being a little scared, but I didn't really know what being scared meant because we hadn't experienced anything bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So it was a little bit of an excitement for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And I also think we did have one suitcase along, but I am not 100 percent sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">But I just knew that nobody stopped us. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Nobody came over and there were no Germans on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to inspect it. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Later on, you see all these stories of people being asked to show passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">It wasn't — didn't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">The only thing that happened was, while we were away that they would — they came to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to ask for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">That I know and I know that our maid said when she opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">They knocked, Friday night, on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">We weren't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">This is just what we heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">They knocked on everybody's <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">They had a list from the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> about all the Jews, where we lived and she said — when she opened and asked for us, she said, "They wouldn’t be so stupid to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And she just closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">They didn't go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">They didn't — maybe they went in to look, but they didn't take anything from the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">They left everything intact. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And as a matter of fact, I don't know if I am wondering if I should continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">My father had bought a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">We lived 1n an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> [<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> ], and he had bought a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> meanwhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">But we didn't get to move into it and when, when we came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , we moved into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">It was furnished and everything and he rented it out to a woman before we left, and that woman married a German soldier or Kommandant.” </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So when we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> — my memories are coming back now — there were Hitler's picture all over the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And the movers were, you know, like the Danish movers, they kicked and it was like they kicked all the pictures down from the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and you know they were very angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But otherwise the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was standing and, you know, a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> was there and then we moved into when we came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Let's go back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  Meanwhile, let's go back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">We were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">It takes about 30 minutes, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Snekkersten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I don't know why my father knew to get off at from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Snekkersten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">He didn't know anybody there except that he was closest to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , and we got off the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , went down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , you know, out off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and a man comes to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Tall, I don't remember his face exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">He was — he looked he would be about 40 years old at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And he said, "I know why you are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I am Mr. Bagge, Herr Bagge.” </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Please come with me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And we just followed him and we came into a big white <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he said, "Just stay with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I'll take care of you ‘til we find you a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing boat</span> to take you to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And he took about a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">We stayed there and you know, we had — it was upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">We stayed in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And everyday — my father's blond so he didn't look Jewish, so he and Mr. Bagge would go — I mean my mother and I were dark or I wouldn't have gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">But my father was blond and he went with Mr. Bagge every day down to the — to see if you could get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing boat</span> to take us to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">You know, you had to get a man that would take us and pay and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And it was hard because everybody was trying to flee at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And one day my father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and said he got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rowboat</span> instead. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">He couldn't get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">He got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rowboat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So we would go that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And we all got dressed and were ready to leave and then he didn't come to pick us, the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And they said that —I think he did come and he shows his hands and they had big blisters on it from the night before and he couldn't row again he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So we couldn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And then, I think it took one or two more days, my father came back and he said — I mean, he came back every time with Mr. Bagge — that they found somebody would take us the next day at three o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">It was during the day, which itself was strange that we were able to flee during the day, but I was told later on that the Germans were paid off. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So, the Germans that were guarding the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> , it was a <span class="DLF">harbor</span> , wouldn't say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So that day we just walked down from Mr. Bagge's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I remember when we left, I remember his <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> had a big picture window * Commander (German) * Mr. Bagge (Danish) and he turned around and he cried and he just hoped we would get over there safely. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">He was such a wonderful man. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I mean he risked his life and he didn't do it just for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">He did it, lots of people went through his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span

id="223">I just heard that he had died now. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">But I don't know when, but he died an old man. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">But he really saved many, many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">So we walked down to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing boat</span> and I remember was the going down — you know this <span

class="sentence" id="240">And I remember I was so proud of myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I was the only one not being seasick. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And we stayed very quietly and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And when we were in the middle of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> between <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="438">ANSWER:  Well, there was no— the way I look at it, there was no difference between being Jewish and not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And I did not come from a religious background so maybe I never felt anything and I remember very — I mean today I feel differently, but I remember standing outside our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with some friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">We had just been going to <span class="BUILDING">dance class</span> and we were discussing whether one should marry — one should stay and marry only Jewish people, and they all felt sure, and they were not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I remember they were saying that they felt that Jews should marry Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And I say, “Why you marry? </span><span class="sentence" id="443">You are in love with them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="444">This is my background I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">You don't marry for religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">You marry. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">But we really did not feel any difference, there was — of being Jewish or not Jewish in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">My husband might tell you different stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">I don't know — because he comes from a religious background. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">So it's different. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">But I, I didn't feel any discrimination ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Never heard the word “Jew” said. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And I went to — well, the first few years I went to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> and when I came back, I was — there was one more boy that was Jewish in the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">When I went to the <span class="BUILDING">higher schools</span> , there was another girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I went to an all girls’ school then from sixth grade ‘til I graduated. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And there were two Jews in the class: me and another girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">QUESTION:  Did you feel any difference because there were only two of you?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="461">ANSWER:  How I remember that, we couldn’t get chocolate. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Because I knew my father would buy things that nobody could get, so he would like buy — you know, it was rationing, and he would get it for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">But it was not a hard life. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">We went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and just classes — I know people didn’t have as many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> as we do now. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I would go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> always, like everybody else.</span></p>
