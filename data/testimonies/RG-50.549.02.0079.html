ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Can you talk some about that day and what -- what was your -- what were -- what were your expectations? </span><span class="sentence" id="1">What did you think your future was going to be when you got married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  Wow. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">It was a very strange way that -- that I got married, to begin with, and I don’t remember how much time I had to talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">But I mentioned at that time that I met my husband a year before, and we met on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">All that was there, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And so I haven’t actually seen him prior to that, for a whole year. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Prior to the wedding, I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">For a whole year. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">He came two weeks before our wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And I had never in my life seen a Jewish wedding, and I have never -- so I really didn't know exactly what was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And very differently from weddings that I’m witnessing now, including my sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">It never even occurred to me to think about arranging for anything or thinking about anything except my dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">That was about the only thing I thought about. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And everything else I sort of just let be. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">It’s like somebody -- was somebody else’s thing to do it, a sort of -- sort of like I was going to a party, and my col -- main -- my -- my main concern was to think about, you know, Dan’s coming and how 1s that going to be? </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Am I st -- am I truly, really in love or am I just making things up? </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Am I just bored in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , or unhappy in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> or lonely? </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Because, of course, I had come there only -- less than a year before and I'd left all my friends behind in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Had a boyfriend whom I, you know, forgot the minute I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Obviously it wasn’t a very serious thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And I lived a totally, totally different life in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> than I had ever thought I would live. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I mean, not only did I not know about Jewish weddings, I didn’t know anything about Jewish period. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And you know, I knew very little on -- my experience was one month in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> before that, and I -- you know, a few years before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So everything was sort of going to [indecipherable] plus I was going to meet my aunt and uncle, who were coming in from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> - from -- I’m sorry, from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and I had never seen them as a adult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Which aunt and uncle was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  That’s my father’s brother and my father’s sister, both of whom decided to come in for my wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And so there were so many different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I mean, I have -- I-I have -- I had very little -- almost no contact with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My aunt, of course, I didn't even see a -- at all after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I only had pictures, I knew she existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My father’s sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Can you say their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Lina. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">That was Lina who married a wi -- a Weesler, and I knew that she had two children and I had the -- I had the daughter’s photograph with me when I was living in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Her photograph was left because was -- had been sent to my maternal grandparents, must be. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I don’t know how I got that photograph. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And it was she as a child, and it’s a beautiful little girl with -- and she’s holding a gorgeous doll. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And I had that after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And it was sort of like all -- like looking at Shirley Temple, like a movie star or something, because we didn’t have such dolls or such clothes or such anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So that was -- that -- that was my only image of -- of this aunt with this daughter, my dau -- my cousin Dina who now lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And her - her -- she had a brother, Rubin, whom -- whose picture I did not have and I -- he also now lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and of course, we now we know -- know each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So -- so my aunt was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And then my uncle was coming, whom I last saw, I think as a seven or eight year old in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , because he came back from the prisoner of war camps -- camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">He was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">He was in the Yugoslav army when the war started and so he -- he was -- he survived as a prisoner of war, he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">He married a woman he met there in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , I think he may have known her from before. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">She and her three sisters had all together survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Oh, it’s a unbelievable story which I can’t get her to talk about on tape, which I wish I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">They now live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">But at that time he came -- he came, he found me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> where I was living during the war, and he -- I remember that he -- he tried to talk to me about going with him, and I refused to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I remem -- sort of remember that conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I -- I -- I had that memory, and of course he left me a picture, which I have, which you know, beautiful handwriting says, this is a -- in memor -- to remember him by. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And he’s wearing his army uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So, all of a sudden this aunt and uncle were going to come to the wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">So that was going to be that. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And of course my m -- my future mother-in-law was coming with my husband on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And her brother, who is -- who survived the war -- actually th - my husband’s family left -- left <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> actually mol -- <span class="COUNTRY">Moldavia</span> -- <span class="COUNTRY">Moldova</span> in the early 1900’s, but this brother went to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> rather than to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And he remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> studying medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">As a physician went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oran</span> , to al -- <span class="COUNTRY">Algeria</span> , married there, had one child. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And during the conflict in <span class="COUNTRY">Algeria</span> with the liberation of <span class="COUNTRY">Algeria</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , they came to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And they had a -- at the time of my marriage, they had a 13 year old -- 12 year old son. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So they were coming to the wedding as well, and my brother-in-law, whom I| had met bef -- before he came to visit me one time in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And everybody, of course, had waited for my brother-in-law Leon to -- to inform everyone, you know, who is this person that my husband was getting -- my future husband was getting ready to marry. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And Leon is, you know, he’s darling, he’s here all the time, we are very close now. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But a -- he wasn’t very -- there’s a big joke that at the time he only wrote to them, keep smiling. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">That’s about what he sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And we had a good time, you know, we -- we -- when he came to visit, which was -- it would be before the wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And you know, we -- we rowed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and sang row, row, row the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake Geneva</span> , and had a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">But he -- he didn't tell me -- I mean, he was telling me things about Dan, but it was -- my future husband, but it was like, you know, sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So I had to de -- still depend on my letters, so he didn't -- wasn’t very explicit. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So -- and then of course -- so all these people were coming, and -- and Dan was coming two weeks ahead of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And I think my -- so my wedding memories really go back to - mostly to that day when he arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  And getting ready for his arrival.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  And that was more important than the wedding itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And that looms sort of large in terms of preparation and anxiety and -- and what was I going to wear and what was -- what was I going to look like and what he looked like and do I remember him, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  It had been a whole year since you’d seen him, wow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  Yes, almost, not quite. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Yeah, we -- we met in the fall of the previous year. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And this was -- yeah, it was almost a year, it was July 15" -- I’m sorry, August 15" that he arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">We were married September one. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So my aunt, who now lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , the one who just recently did this interview with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">She remembers every single detail and tells it over and over and over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">She sort of lived through that with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And this was -- this was one sort of aspect also of the wedding, is that she -- she was very lonely in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">She was married to my uncle, my brother’s -- my brother’s ha -- I’m sorry, my hu -- my father’s brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">That was Yoshi and she’s Monda. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Monda and Yoshi survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> and ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and had two children there. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">They lived from the beginning from hand to mouth, 1n fact they were in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">relocation camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And Monda got incredibly -- I don’t know, I think I should say traumatized by the experience more-so than any of my other relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And her whole family except for her sister was killed in -- in -- during the war, and she found herself now in this new <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> without a language, without any means and -- and having these children, and she became -- basically she- she -- she spent all her time cleaning and cooking and just taking care and cleaning to the extent of being really beyond no-normal cleaning. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I mean, to sacrificing any kind of -- much social contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And they lived in this very closed Orthodox Jewish community, where she didn’t have true, true, good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And she tells me the story that even my arrival was a sort of like they -- you know, they were wondering, you know, how is this going to be, they didn't have much money. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And how was this going to be, you know, they have to support another person. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And I was going to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and I needed a bit of money for -- for tuition and for travel, because I -- they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montre</span> and I had to travel to <span class="BUILDING">University of Lausanne</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And they were able to get a little scholarship for me from the Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">But it was a very close community. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And what she found, and I’m telling you what she says to me, what she found that -- that I became her best friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Because at that point I was 19 and she was 30 some -- could figure out how old she was, but I can’t remember it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Anyway -- and when she found out that I had met my husband -- I mean my future husband on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and when the letters arrived, she went through that courtship with me, and almost sort of vicariously lived through that. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And so when the day came of the -- of the wa -- I mean, she remembers in detail what I said to her about, you know, when he proposed and -- and you know, where she was sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">She was sitting in the -- she was working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , cleaning something and I came and -- and told her and just exactly what I told her, you know, and so it was like a big thing for her, bigger than it was for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I was like, yeah, I’m getting married. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Sort of a crazy 19 year old, 20 year old --
QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  -- by that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So that I think, you know, she remembers in detail about -- and tells me all over again about, you know, my going to -- to get Dan at the -- at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , you know, wearing a -- a two piece blue dress with, you know, that was- that was perfectly ironed and my nails were perfectly done, etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And it’s funny because -- and of course, I think I told on the other tape that one of the -- anyhow, I don’t know, that -- that one of the nice things that my uncle had done for me is that before Dan came and I met him again, my uncle said, you know, the wedding is all arranged for, which was fine with me, I hadn’t do -- done very much about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And -- but you have not -- you know, you think you want to get married, but if something doesn’t go right, you have two weeks and if you want to cancel it, it’s okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  Oh --
ANSWER:  Which was --
QUESTION:  That’s great of him to say that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  That was very great of him to say and I appreciated it then and I appreciate it more as I am an adult and have children of my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">But he did say that, and so I have that in the background, so I was feeling fairly safe and okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And now, as an adult I look back and everybody says, my God, what a risk, you know, all of this thing was. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But it didn’t seen to me that way at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I mean, you know, you marry -- you meet somebody, you like them, and you just get married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Did you have a sense of -- this was more than 10 years after the end of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  But did it have a sense for you because of all your aunts and uncles being there who had survived, and even though you were a child then, did it have any sense of continuance, and we -- of surviving, people having survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Was there that kind of a celebrat -- celebration as part of it? </span><span class="sentence" id="121">You hear people say this, people who got married in the late 40’s --
ANSWER:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  -- or immediately after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I’m wondering if that attitude was at all present in your wedding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Probably less so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  Maybe because -- because it was late -- so much later and because I was so young when I lost my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And I lived with my uncle -- my -- my mother’s sister’s husband, whom I adored and he adored me. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And you know, I star -- I started my life with him when I was, you know, in <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So -- so I was in -- it-it -- it was, in a way, contrary to that 1-in -- in a sense that he wasn’t going to be able to be at my wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So in a way, I -- I her -- I felt the absence of a parent, but not my real parents, because it was so far in the background. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I mean, I know that that is how my uncle and my aunt felt, and -- and to my uncle it was extremely important. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">That’s why, you know, my aunt tells me that to my uncle -- and he had told me -- he passed away in 90, but he told me how important it was to him that -- that there was this continuation and th -- it was extremely important to them that I marry someone who is Jewish and that was behind their inviting me, much -- very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And that was said to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">You know, they wanted me to -- to meet people because they knew at -- my aunt says that she knew that -- he knew that if I was left in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> I wouldn’t marry somebody Jewish and that would be the end of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">There was just nobody to meet there. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And they thought I would meet someone in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montre</span> , through them. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And I met people, but I had pre-empted it all by meeting Dan on the -- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So -- so it was extremely important to them, it was -- it was for them, because they were that generation to -- who understood it. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I ha -- I-I don’t think I understood it fully.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  I may have understood it after my children were born, but at that time I didn’t dwell much on the Holocaust and on the losses. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I grew up happy and in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and just being fairly norm -- normal teenager. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And I intellectually knew, but emotionally [I ru -- I -- you know, as a child I used to say things like oh, I have to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Now, if I had a mother, I wouldn’t have to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">But that’s sort of more, you know, a kid thing, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Yup.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  I can -- I-I think, yeah, I had more of a kind of a response like maybe divorced -- divorced ch -- parents’ children have, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="148">If I didn’t have this stepmother I would be doing much better kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">But some of it is totally unrealistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So the fact that my uncle wasn’t coming to the wedding was sad for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And I had originally when I -- when I decided that I would get married to Dan, I -- I -- I wou -- I -- I was -- I wrote to him with great trepidation about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">My Swiss family was happy bec -- because Dan was Jewish and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I translated all the letters and they knew all the particulars, you know, and everything read well, so it was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">But my uncle, of course, knew nothing about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">My -- my uncle -- my -- Dietrich is what I called him, so Ill refer to him that way, probably easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">He knew nothing about anything until I -- and in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> it was like an unspoken -- ma, what do I say unspoken, it was a spoken word. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">You are not to get married until you graduate from the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So here I am in my sophomore year and I’m getting married to somebody and taking off fre -- for -- for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , leaving, basically, you know, him behind, which was mentioned in a very unkind way one of the books written about [indecipherable] and about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But --
QUESTION:  You’ve mentioned that before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  It just really bugged me. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So -- but because I didn’t sort of say, oh I’m -- you know, I’m going to leave you, which is circumstances, and I certainly did communicate with him from now on and -- and [indecipherable] that. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">But -- but he couldn’t come because he di -- he was just not healthy enough and -- and strong enough to make the journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And he wrote that -- you know, he wrote back saying that if I -- if my aunt and uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> felt that it was a good thing for me to do, then it was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So I went ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Anyway, so there are [indecipherable] sort of a [indecipherable |
QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">So you got married in September 1“, 1959, is that --
ANSWER:  1958.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  °58. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And did you go immediately to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  Oh, it was very strange, it was -- it -- we couldn’t get my visa on time, so we sort of spent a month in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I had to go -- well, we got a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Oh, there was American visa, of course meaning that you have to have your health checked, and then you have to go and -- that -- but also my passport was expiring, my Yugoslav passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So we had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> and extend my passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And all of that took at least a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">At -- at one point it looked almost as if Dan was going to have to leave without me. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">But we traveled -- w-we -- we traveled some, we went to some parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lausanne</span> and -- and we got -- we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gstaad</span> , and went to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and then back, so that that’s how we spent the month. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">It was truly a honeymoon -- a moon, a moon, how a moon [indecipherable] fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And then finally the visa came and -- and the passport was extended and the visa came and -- and we were able to -- to -- to go together. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">But I have to tell you -- I don’t know whether I said anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I should have listened to the end of the tape, but I don’t know whether I told you anything about what the wedding was like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  I don’t think so.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="410">QUESTION:  Wow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">ANSWER:  So -- well, being pregnant meant you have to find a doctor and you have to pay the doctor and I have an -- had an idiot, but that’s not because we didn’t pay him, we did, but he was just bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And we pay -- tried to -- we painted our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ourselves and -- after we got tired of taking a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and ending up with brown dots on our heads because the paint was dropping down, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">So we painted and we had some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">But then things got really exciting because Dan got a -- a position at Walter Reed and he said he couldn’t come until June because he had to -- he promised to be at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoffstra</span> til the end of the school year, and they said they would wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And so that was -- that was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">So by June I was already highly pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Wanda was born at the end of August. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">We took whatever possessions we had and we headed for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And that was great.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="422">ANSWER:  We got here in a hot summer with very little to no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">We borrowed some money.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">QUESTION:  What -- what kind of job did he get?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="425">ANSWER:  As a researcher.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER:  In -- ina <span class="INT_SPACE">lab</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Walter Reed</span> , which -- where he remained for the rest of his -- for the rest of his life.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="429">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Not in -- in that <span class="BUILDING">lab</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">He came as a -- as a researcher, he eventually headed the <span class="BUILDING">lab</span> and the section. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And they were working on -- it was a-again a no -- tropical medicine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">QUESTION:  Oh, really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">ANSWER:  Which is what he was interested in. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Eventually he -- he worked in selentum chemistry. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">He had a -- his Ph.D. had to do with -- w-with e-e-extracting a new alkaloid from opium.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">QUESTION:  Hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">ANSWER:  And so that kind of tropical medicine was of interest to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Eventually he ended up working on anti-malarials. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">But they -- at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Walter Reed</span> at that time they were also doing anti-nuclear medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">So I think I’m saying it right, because it was a long time that -- that they were working on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">They were thinking ab-bout how to -- of course it’s the army, so they were always thinking in terms of, you know, what are we going to be afflicted with that we have to counteract.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">ANSWER:  And so the medicine was going in -- in -- the research was going in the direction of if there is a nuclear attack -- and they were still thinking a lot about that, it was still after the 50’s and after McCarthyism.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="449">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  That’s anti-radiation. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">So anti-radiation and then eventually that kind of died down and they went more into doing anti-malarials and that’s where really he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And anyway, So th -- so w-we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and I will never forget the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> we stayed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">It was on <span class="DLF">Dupont Circle</span> in those old, old <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> before they were all destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And barely any air conditioning and the temperature was high and I was very pregnant, and huge. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And it was hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">But, we went to <span class="BUILDING">Walter Reed</span> , and right next to <span class="BUILDING">Walter Reed</span> there were these <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> and there were plenty of <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> to be had. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">It was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And we got, right across from <span class="BUILDING">Walter Reed</span> -- I, of course, didn’t arrive -- right across from <span class="BUILDING">Walter Reed</span> , there was this -- what it was called? </span><span class="sentence" id="459">A <span class="INT_SPACE">garden apartment</span> that was beautiful and light and had two <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and a big <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and -- and a <span class="DLF">patio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And it was the same amount of money, it was like 115 dollars, I remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">It was the same amount of money like that hole in the <span class="DLF">wall</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">So, I was thrilled. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And of course, I had been lonely and Ill never forget that Dan went to work and he could walk across the <span class="DLF">street</span> to work and somebody came and knocked on my <span class="DLF">door</span> , and there was a neighbor from upstairs with -- pregnant, and with a baby on her arms, and she said, oh I heard you moved in, welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I was like -- I thought I was going to faint. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">No one talked to me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , ever.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="608">QUESTION:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="609">ANSWER:  I had studied English. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And I had some pr -- private lessons, but I struggled greatly that year, trying to do French with people who were ahead of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And the same thing happened again when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">I was still struggling with French and they again put me too far ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I could never -- you -- you can’t make a decision what you want to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">It’s like what’s available and where they think you should be, with -- without regard and -- where you actually are as a student. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">So I thought, oh God, I’m going to do this again? </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And when I realized that you can start from the beginning here, I enrolled in 101, French 101. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Well, they threw me out of there and I went to a higher level class, but I was at MC and I also started taking Spanish, which was the smartest thing I ever did. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">But anyway, I eventually graduated from <span class="BUILDING">University of Maryland</span> with a degree in French and a minor in -- in Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And then, at that point, ESL became already -- started to become a field a-and I had - because I dragged through <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> for such a long period of time, I didn’t go like three or four years, I don’t know how long it took me, a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And I had -- I started teaching ESL at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Takoma Park</span> in the evening program, before I had any kind of a degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Because I -- while I was a student there, they recognized that I could -- that I knew something about what -- what -- what needed to be taught and that I understood the process. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And they started the evening programs for the new Vietnamese community coming in.</span></p>

And she mentions it -- something about the Holocaust practically every time I see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">Now, whether she does it because she knows I went through the experience, or whether it’s general, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">But people either -- I know people who talk about it a lot, like my aunt, or people who never talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">I was probably someplace in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">And s-so -- so this -- this -- this fellow said they will -- had this group and I said oh, I’d like to come and see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">So I have joined the group since, and have -- it’s supposed -- it’s been interesting to listen to other people’s experiences, and to -- to see to what extent -- I - |’m -- I was also trying to categorize, you know, are people who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> different from those who didn’t, or there a -- are -- there 1 -- there is a sort of great affinity among people who came from different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , I noticed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">You know, just to -- there are many people from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , for example, and many -- fewer from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or certainly fewer from <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">And people meet -- we meet once a month and people bring food to share and there is a program. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">And some of the program -- for a long time they did almost nothing but taken turns to talk about --
QUESTION:  Themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1115">ANSWER:  -- themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1116">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1117">ANSWER:  And many of them would say that this is the first time that they had talked about themselves to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">And many of them have talked about their relationship to their kids, or how their kids don’t really -- some of them feel that their kids don’t care to hear about it, and others have kids who are very involved, and -- an-and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">It’s -- it’s -- it’s been sort of an eye opener for me, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1120">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1121">ANSWER:  To be -- to be with these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">Some of them are involved in doing volunteer work, many of -- a number of them are volunteering at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">And so that’s sort of been an interesting experience for me, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1124">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1125">ANSWER:  And -- so | -- I find that I much m -- some of them have become personal friends, So it’s -- 1t’s -- 1t’s sort of the -- somehow I’m so more -- so much more involved in thinking or doing or m -- or meeting with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">I went to th -- there was a -- recently, just a few months ago there was a huge meeting at the Mayflower of the hidden children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">So it’s a -- you know, with seminars and -- and speeches and personal explorations, and -- so this is just a -- sort of another world I’ve sort of been in lately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1128">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">What about your kids and -- and I-I’m assuming all along here that your kids know your story and --
ANSWER:  Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1130">QUESTION:  -- you’ve never had any trouble telling them about it and wanted them to know, I’m sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1131">ANSWER:  Yeah, they know the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1132">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1133">ANSWER:  They nev -- they don’t ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">I’ve -- I’ve yet to -- ask to see -- to hear one of them -- well, maybe they asked questions as children, I can’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">But right now, as adults, maybe they feel that they know everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">They don’t ask, I don’t tell anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">I just -- we never get on that subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1138">QUESTION:  Do you think -- oftentimes people s-say their kids are afraid to ask because they think it’s painful for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1139">ANSWER:  Possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">I have never asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">I think now we are getting to a stage where my grandchildren will know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">In fact, Daniella, who 1s now nine and a half started talking about Anne Frank recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">Apparently her mother has been reading it with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">And I don’t -- I didn't talk to Iona, to her mother, to see what that was all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">Daniella is pretty with it, so you know, she -- for a nine and a half year old, she -- she reads well, and she understands a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">And the other day we were talking about the black experience, and she was talking to me about the <span class="DLF">underground railroad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">So I’m sure she could understand some of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">She goes to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> , so they must have been talking about -- about it there for Yom HaShoah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1149">QUESTION:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1150">ANSWER:  But I have not had the time to sit down with her and sort of obliquely say something to see if she will come up with something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">Obviously I’m not going to start telling her anything unless I feel that she must know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">I -- I -- you know, with your grandchildren you don’t know exactly when they’re ready for what, because you don’t have them every day and I-I -- I don’t want to dump anything on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1153">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">It’s always an interesting -- there’s -- 1t’s an interesting issue that comes up in all these interviews is, when do you tell them --
ANSWER:  When do you tell.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1155">QUESTION:  -- how do you tell them, and --
ANSWER:  [have not the foggiest idea, I have no memory of when I told my kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">I think probably they were asking question -- you know, they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> with me when they were very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">And I probably told them early that my parents were killed in a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">I don’t know whether I told them how, or -- I think I told them why. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">And I may have told them how, I may have told them they got killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , but they probably found out later on what that meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">I don’t know that -- I don’t know -- I d -- Id -- I do -- I can’t think of th -- of any time when I had this moment where I would sit them down and talk to them about it, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1161">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1162">ANSWER:  I don’t remember that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1163">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1164">ANSWER:  I may have, but I rather doubt it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1165">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">What -- wh-wh-what was it like for you when war broke out again in the 90’s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1167">ANSWER:  Oh, I was very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">And again, that probably again has to do with my experience in post-war Yugoslavia as a -- as a product of communist education. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">I really felt like they -- they -- they need to stay together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">I -- and I -- I just wanted <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to go and bomb <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span> and stop the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">I think I was right, but the Croats -- I still feel -- think I was right, but I don’t know whether you were reading Louis in the “New York Times.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">He -- I -- I really agreed with his point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">I think people here -- I mean, the politicians here, the government felt -- you know, they thought it was going to be another <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">No, I mean, <span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span> is going to be another Vietnam, but herl -- but <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> could have been saved, but not by -- by doing what [indecipherable] was doing, like siding with Milosevic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">But -- but by getting him out of power and -- and reestablishing law and order and -- and -- and some semblance of democracy.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1182">ANSWER:  I was trying to explain to them -- everybody was asking me and I was trying to explain that it’s not a Vietnam and that it could be stopped easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">I think it could have been stopped very easily from the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">I was starting to explain that there are -- th-the business of, you know, the ethnic animosity is age long -- you know, ages long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">Well, of course there were, but I mean -- so there are between the north and the south in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but we don’t go killing each other, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">Yeah, there are -- there are crazies running around in bars and stripes, so what, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">And the fact that I felt like, you know, you could have -- yo -- if you had that kind of leadership in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you could have this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in a -- in turmoil at no time at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">You get a lot of those Nazi party types, or you know, David whatever his name was, or somebody elected t-t --

<p><span class="sentence" id="1215">ANSWER:  True, and I think -- I think it’s my Shoah tape, I -- which I haven’t seen the whole thing either, but I remember doing it and I remember talking about everything and I cried at the very end because I think -- well, I think as the loss of my parents as being a horrendous thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">I think it was horrendous for them, and I don’t think it’s as horrendous for me, which is a horrible thing to say, but because I have no memory of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">I can imagine what must have been like, now that I have children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">After I had children, I was thinking of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">What must have been like for my parents to have given me away” Basically, that’s what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">And even worse for my -- to -- to give away my brother.

<p><span class="sentence" id="1230">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">You were quite young.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1232">ANSWER:  Yeah, I was 54. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">And I think -- the reason I say I’m luck -- I was lucky -- and I was, because I had these people through my life, you know, first my uncle and then my husband, who really were there for me to lean on and -- and -- and just continue, you know, in my nice, as you say, straight way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">If not for them, I don’t know what my life would have been like. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">It would have been -- I -- I may have -- I -- I was born with -- with -- with a person -- with this personality, but who knows how my personality would have been developed had I not had them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">So, yes I’m lucky that I was -- that I was born -- I mean, it’s good that I was born this way and I ha -- that I have the personality I have, but -- but I was extremely lucky to -- to have -- to have had that op -- you know, to have had these people in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">And -- and later on, you know, to have my children, who are, you know, who were here, and -- and a lot of friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">That, of course, you know, could have all been different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">Let’s say that I continued living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Long Island</span> , let’s say that I didn't meet my husband, that I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">I’m very glad to have -- to have been able to -- to turn back toward being Jewish, which I knew nothing about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">I knew I was Jewish, but 1t meant nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1242">QUESTION:  When did it start to mean something to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1243">ANSWER:  I think -- you know, I have early, early remembrances both pro and con. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">I don’t think I ever told anybody this story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">I remember in ne -- a story of rejection. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">I had a little -- this 1s true confession story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">I don’t think I ever told anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">I -- I remember that I had, I don’t know why it was mine, but I had a little Mogen Davide, that was family’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">And why, at one time, must have been in one of those times when I felt like being Jewish was horrible because, you know, children told me that Jews killed Christ and it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">And I gave that away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">I gave it to one of my -- one of the like farmer girls, peasant girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">And I said, well, I’m not going to need this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">So that’s story one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">Then story two, I remember finding papers in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I found a -- the music for [indecipherable] and I could play the piano and I played that and somehow like from some other world, that sounded very emotionally stirring to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">And I don’t know how old I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">I was fairly young. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">And then, of course, came my - the watershed trip to -- to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , when all of a sudden I found myself in an Orthodox family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">And -- but -- but I had such a good feeling toward my uncle, that -- my father’s brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">I-I remember seeing him as he waited -- he came to wait for me at the <span class="DLF">border</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came into the <span class="DLF">border</span> and I’m looking out a <span class="DLF">window</span> and I’m thinking, am I going to recognize him? </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">But I did, and he recognized me immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">We did exchange pictures, but still I thought I might not recognize him, and I was fairly scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">That was 1954, I think, I was young and -- high school kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">And I had this really very warm experience and very emotional experience that this was someone I was related to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">I had never -- I -- I hadn’t -- from the time that I was like seven, when I saw my other co -- uncle for the last time, I never had any -- met any family members. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">It was so -- it was stirring. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">And then coming into this family, I was very willing to -- to learn and to find out and to think -- to accept the fact that I was Jewish and -- and everything that went with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">And you know, at that point, I mean that -- that -- that -- that Mogen Davide experience was I must have been like eight years old or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">Was very long time ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">And -- but I -- I remembered it because I often thought about it later and I kind of regretted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">So it was -- it was sort of a new -- an -- an -- an -- an experience that -- that I was willing to -- to accept and it just felt -- it felt right, just sort of right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">And, you know, when -- when I met Dan, of course, I -- I didn’t know he was Jewish, because I couldn’t tell Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">I can -- you know, now I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">It’s like I couldn’t tell on the phone somebody who was from the south, and certainly someone who was black, I couldn’t tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">I remember being totally surprised that Dan once got off the phone and said, this was a black lady and she wanted to know this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">I was like, how do you know?

ANSWER:  Well, another bit of luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">I think the fact that my in-laws and that whole generation of people, their siblings, were all immigrants. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">They all came early, but they came in the 1920’s, made a huge difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">So, my husband and -- and all the - and his brother and all the cousins, they were all first generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">They had all grown up with parents who talked about the old <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and so I was accepted absolutely totally and completely into the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">And they have -- that family has been absolutely fantastic to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">And after Dan’s death, cause he -- he was the oldest of the -- of the children, and he di -- of that generation -- he was the oldest of that generation and he died first. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">And the -- the ca -- the cousins -- well, his brother is, you know, very close to me, but all -- but that’s almost to be expected, but the cousins have all absolutely rallied around me and I am absolutely part of that family, totally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">The cousins that I mentioned before who were -- lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arlington</span> , they eventually returned, had lived all over and then they came from -- th-they’re -- they were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and they’re now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arlington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">And I see them all the time, we went to the march yesterday together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">And the other cousin, this person’s brother, Danny who lives in <span class="REGION">Long Island</span> , they were just here also, they went to a wedding here, and they stayed with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">So it’s just we’re -- we are very -- everybody is very close, and their children are close to my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">My children, unfortunately, don’t have any cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">Their -- I only have these two children and my brother-in-law had no children and I have no siblings, so my children have no cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">And they pretty much consider Dan’s cousin’s children their cousins and -- and they’re quite close. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">So I was s-super, super lucky on that score as well.</span></p>
