<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Tell me your full name and then tell me when and where you were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I am Rudolf Haas and I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1912.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and your family life dating back to the earliest memories that you have - even before World War I.
ANSWER:  On that I can't quite remember, but when I recall my earliest years, that was approximately 1917, 1918, during the First World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">We lived in an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> which was the most common arrangement those days, and probably still is. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My father had a small business of his own selling paper material and printing to the various <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">It was a middle class family, quite reasonably comfortable, without the luxuries of this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">You had a cold water flat actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">You only had hot water once a week when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen stove</span> was on because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen stove</span> heated the water as 1t were. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And so once a week you had hot water. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">That's when you took a shower and a bath in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Otherwise, you had these old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> - you know, these coal fired <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And during the 17-18's, during the war, coal supplies became very short and I still remember when we had to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pushcart</span> and go to the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> where the coal was brought in. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And you had to try to get the supply of coal to take <span class="BUILDING">home</span> so you could be warm during the winter years - 1917-1918. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And I also remember those days when you had to get up in the middle of the night and go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> as a bomb shelter because the French primarily bombed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> in those days, and I remember the tracer bullets at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I can still see that, believe it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And I remember the shaking of the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> when the bomb landed nearby, and one actually did get this close - I would say it was a hundred yards from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">There was a <span class="DLF">zoological garden</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> and that's where the bomb landed. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And I remember the impact of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And I remember seeing the bomb crater the next day when we looked at the damage that was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And, so I still have quite vivid memories of the First World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And I also remember the great day in 1918 when the War ended, and for the first time then we were able to have rolls for breakfast again. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And that was something I had never experienced before because that was a special treat. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">During the war that wasn't available. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">That's about primarily what I remember of the War years. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I did enter the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in 1918. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I started <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> in 1918 and, <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> let's say. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And I remember one of the first things we had to do was practice going to the <span class="DLF">bomb shelter</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">That was then in the spring of 1918. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">That's when <span class="BUILDING">school</span> started - in April usually. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">So that still sticks in my memory quite vividly... My first <span class="BUILDING">school</span> year was practicing to go to the <span class="BUILDING">bomb shelter</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  Tell me in general about... Tell me a little more about your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Introduce me to your family that was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> - your grandparents...
ANSWER:  Well, I, actually I only knew very little of my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Our own family was my father, mother and two sisters who were quite a bit older. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">One sister was ten years older; the other sister was eight years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And so I actually had very little contact with them until later years. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">But we had a grandmother living with us who was quite ill, and I remember she was bedridden. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And for a short period of time that I recall, she was taken care of at the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and died probably in the early 20's. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">That was my father's mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">My mother's mother had died a long time ago as had my father's father. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So the only one I really knew was my mother's father who was born in 1850, lived in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">He was a cattle dealer like so many people in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and he was active until 1930 when he passed away at the age of 80, which was quite a remarkable age in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">That was the place where we use to spend our summers. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">There was no such thing as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> for children or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">We had a vacation in the summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">is short only six weeks usually and that was spent in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with some relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So what I especially treasured was a vacation with my grandfather who had a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> , and I was able to hold the reins for the horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">That was the biggest treat that I could think of. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So, several summers I spent with my grandfather in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and enjoyed country living which was typical, with running water from the <span class="DLF">fountain</span> 1n the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">horse stable</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> - or actually inside of the <span class="DLF">yard</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> kept the horses - and once and awhile a cow... some chickens. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So that was our summer vacation and our summer treat. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And I remember the mid-twenties when radio became popular. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And I remember - I must have been about ten years old when I started building a radio receiver and you had to string a wire across the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> , or somewhere where you could possibly hang up an antenna - and had a little crystal with a needle on it - fashioned a radio receiver. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">That was quite an accomplishment in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Otherwise, the pleasures were very simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">You played soccer with the kids - ball of any form - ball games of any form. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">But, all in all, 1t was a relatively simple existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  So then tell me about schooling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER: <span class="BUILDING"> School</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  Yea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Well I entered a Jewish parochial(ph) school - a day school at the age of... I was still five, not quite six when I entered <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And that was a religious atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Boys and girls were separate in different <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> -- and we had both our religious education as well as secular education during the nine years of <span class="BUILDING">day school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And one of the things that was routine there, that you started languages at an early age. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">At the age of seven you started French and the age of eight you started English. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So every one of the children had two languages to be fairly well versed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">In addition to it, of course, you learned Hebrew and the Bible, and some of the Talmud. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So it was a full day. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Started at 8:00 o'clock in the morning and usually went to 3 or 4 in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So it was a very intensive study course. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And it was routine. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">It wasn't unusual in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And then after the ninth grade I had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> because there was no other <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> available, and there we, again, continued our language classes, and naturally mathematics and physics. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Then, if you wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , you had to also have a course in Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">You had to pass a Latin examination in order to enter <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And as you might know, <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in Europe, at least in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , led directly to the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">There was no such thing as <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">You had to be prepared to enter the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> at the end of the twelfth grade - when you were eighteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And so from the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , directly we went to the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">In those days, that was during the good old days of the German Republic. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">There was a real democratic government to which, I guess, the Germans never got quite use to, but at least you had a great deal of freedom in those days, politically and otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">There was a very liberal education and a very comfortable existence because people were really not polarized in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">That was between 1924 and 1930. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">The life was quite comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">There was very little friction amongst the various groups of the population, and it wasn't until the Nazi Party started the activities when very violent demonstrations occurred, and the Communists on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the Nazis on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> were shooting each other and killing each other during these demonstrations. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">That was the beginning of the violence really, in the late 30's. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And, of course, it continued until 33 when Hitler took over altogether. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So those were dangerous times. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And you could tell by the early 30's that the future of the Jewish people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was at great risk.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  Tell me more about that... I mean, from a personal perspective. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Tell me changes that you saw.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  Well, primarily, the agitation of the Nazi Party which at the very beginning derived most of their appeal by promising the general population to take over all the Jewish businesses and take away their wealth, which they supposedly had, and sold their ideas primarily with anti- Semitism, which was quite easy to do because the economic situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was very bad, and jobs were hard to come by. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So enough people who were looking for some free giveaways for their benefit, so that the idea of the Nazis tried to make popular fell on very fertile ground. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And you could tell that the mood of the population changed steadily and gradually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  And you saw a distinct change and increase in anti-Semitism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Oh, yea, very definitely... very definitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  And what kinds of specific incidents stand out in your memory?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  Well, personally I don't have any stories to tell of any threats, but the usual attitude of youngsters already, let's say, was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">However, while I was at the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> between 27 and 1930, I personally had no real problems of any sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Everybody was still, in those days, very friendly and perfectly congenial; except you knew several of the classmates were members of a nationalistic group. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">You knew they were members, some of them became members of the Nazi Party. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">There were still a fair number of right wing groups that wanted the Kaiser back. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And so between those two right wing political Camps there was considerable friction as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And the worst part was that the political parties increased every year and ended up, I think it was approximately 26 political parties that went to election day. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So there was really no majority anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They had to make friends with strange bedfellows Sometimes to get their votes together. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">But one of the difficulty of the German political system at that time was that the split in 26 different parties made matters a great deal worse and made governing almost impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">In addition to that, of course, the attitudes of the people had changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I still remember very early, as you may know, that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had a social security system even in those days that started after the First World War, where people got unemployment benefits. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And I quite clearly recall a conversation that I listened to on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> where a couple of fellows talked about the pay they were getting for the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And they said, "Ralph(ph), I almost get just as much from social security, but get unemployment compensation, that doesn't pay for me to work even." </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So that added to... started even then. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I've never forgotten the strange idea that people do prefer to take a handout rather than earn it by working. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">It was quite an eye opener and I've never forgotten it. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">It's amazing how these ideas took hold very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">On the other hand, the ideals of democracy didn't sink in very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">They have never quite gotten to that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">They still preferred to be told what to do and be managed rather than to participate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  After... At some point in the 1930's, you were tutoring. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Tell me about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  Well, I... Since we were not particularly wealthy by any means, I had to - well, I wanted to and I more or less had to help pay for my University tuition. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And in order to earn some money for that I was tutoring students, and help them do their homework, sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And I was able to pay most of my tuition with the money that I earned that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Tuition was very minimal anyway because <span class="BUILDING">University</span> was owned by the state and so actually the fees you had to pay were very small by comparison - no comparison what one has to pay today, even at a <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">So I was able to finance my <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> education pretty well - fairly closely anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  But during this time period, when was this, and you were tutoring people who weren't Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">They were not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">That's right, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Well, there was still a large group of the population who was not influenced by the Nazi ideas and continued to be perfectly friendly, and have - not having any prejudice. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So I was able to tutor non-Jewish students til - close to the time I finished <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , which was 1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And, of course, the first couple of years of the Nazi regime, things were not nearly as difficult as they became later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">The people that I worked for... well they became a little bit anxious towards the end and, you know, they wasn't going to announce my activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And they weren't going to tell everybody who was teaching their - was tutoring their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But it was getting more and more difficult, and people had to be more and more careful not to give away their liberal ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">That wasn't very appreciated by the neighbors very frequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And during the years of my <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> training, right after 1933, many of the students - well I wouldn't say many, but a fair number of the students appeared in their storm trooper uniforms during classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And some of the professors - some of the doctors who were teaching appeared in their uniform with a white coat over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I remember one or two of these students in uniform even brought their gun and holster along and had their (rollover-ph) strapped to the side all through the lectures, which wasn't particularly comforting. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">But, we got by. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I go along. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I was able to attend the classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I was able to do the practical work in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> - on the <span class="INT_SPACE">wards</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I even was allowed to deliver babies, which was part of our curriculum. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So all-in-all, I personally was not restricted particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Of course, one was always very careful not to step on anybody's toes. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">But, all- in-all, I was able to get by reasonably well and was able to finish <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , which was, as I said, in 35, two years after Hitler had taken over. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">On the other hand, you had to face every day the signs on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> with all the Nazi propaganda which was anti-Semitic, by promising the people all the supposed wealth that the Jews had. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">They got more and more followers and one could feel that the situation was getting more and more difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">But nobody ever would have dreamt that it would lead to extremes like it actually did. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And politically one always thought, well the economic situation being what it was, that Hitler was never going to Survive another winter because he wouldn't be able to feed his people, and give them anything of what he had promised them. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">But he had more staying power than anybody ever thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So it became quite clear then, by the time I finished <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , that I had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And interestingly enough, in those days the Nazis were perfectly satisfied to have you get out Of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">When I finished my state board, which in the <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> system comes before the medical degree, you graduate without a degree actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">You get a certificate that you have passed the state board that you're entitled to practice medicine, but you do not have a doctoral degree - a doctor title either. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And you can practice medicine - I presume it's still this way - without a doctoral over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">When I finished <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> and I got my certificate that I was entitled to practice medicine, I was told then right there that you won't be allowed to practice medicine in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> - and we won't - you can take your examine for the doctor, which required a thesis and another exam, but we won't give you your diploma until after you've left the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So that was an open invitation to get out, which was, in looking back, was favorable to help us make up our mind because very few people could make up their mind since there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go unless you happen to have relatives in <span class="REGION">foreign countries</span> , particularly in either North or <span class="REGION">South America</span> , which was relatively safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">totally helpless then because the economic situation was the same and we were to the point where nobody was allowed as a foreigner to earn any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So there was a good reason to leave and to find some way, if you could. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So when I got this invitation to go to get myself a M.D. degree elsewhere, I accepted that and went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , which had reciprocity in those days, probably still now, with <span class="BUILDING">German medical schools</span> and <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So on the basis of my German certificate, I could enroll in the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss University</span> , write a thesis, take and exam and then get a doctor degree from the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And, fortunately, I was able to do that and... On the other hand, I had no idea where I was going to go after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to practice medicine because every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , particularly in Europe, was completely closed off. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">If you, as a foreigner, earned any money in any of the <span class="REGION">European countries</span> , you were immediately expelled. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And when it came to practicing medicine, it was was totally impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">In <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , for example, you had to go back to get your high school diploma before you could... and then go to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And the other thing was that they wouldn't let you have a citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">The Swiss had a good system. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">The required period of time that you were... to live in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So they let you stay there for 4’ years and then said, "Now you gotta go." </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So you never were able to accomplish a stay of five years so you could apply for citizenship, even if you had gone back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So that was pretty much the same in all the <span class="REGION">European countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Since the economic situation was bad, they had unemployment which was very high. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">They tried to keep any foreigner out of the <span class="BUILDING">labor market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So unless you had relatives elsewhere, in North or <span class="REGION">South America</span> , you had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">So when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , I really had no plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I had no idea where I could possibly go afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Still, I suppose, I wasn't really at that point to be desperate yet, and I wasn't really sure what would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">But while I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> then, for my last semester to get my M.D. degree from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berne</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , I met an old friend of mine again who was a medical student in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> for a period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">He was from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And while I was there, at one point he asked me for a loan of a small amount of money which I had no idea what he was going to do with. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And it ended up that he took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with that money to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Davos</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> where he shot a Nazi official. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">The Nazis had sent their organizer to organize a Nazi Party in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And somehow or other he heard about him - he knew about him - and apparently this fellow as fairly successful in recruiting some Swiss, a small number - not a really large number I'm sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">But he was recruiting people to foil the Nazi Party in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And the Germans, of course, would have loved to take over <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So he went up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Davos</span> and shot this Nazi gaulietier(ph) - killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">At the time he had the idea of committing suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">He was depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">He was ill and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">But after he had shot this man, he gave himself up and the next morning I was staying at the <span class="BUILDING">rooming house</span> where during those semester months and got a call from the police to ask me to come over there to the <span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Of course it was not unusual in those days, whenever you were in a <span class="COUNTRY">foreign country</span> you were always subject to police checks, and you always had to register with the police wherever you were. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So I did go that morning and, to make the story short, they asked me about this friend of mine and wanted to know what I knew about him and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And I finally said to them, "What's happened to him?" </span><span class="sentence" id="194">They said, "Did you see the newspaper today?" </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I says, "No, I didn't see a newspaper today." </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So they said, "Well, we'd just like to know what you knew about him." </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I said, "Well, what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Did he commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I know he's been depressed." </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Well finally, they said, "Well, he shot Gustov(ph)." </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I said, "What's Gustov?" </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I had not idea who it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I had never heard of him before. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So anyway they realized that I was not an accomplice and I didn't have anything to do with it, but they had found my address in this <span class="BUILDING">students house</span> - in his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> - and they checked out every <span class="NPIP">angle</span> , of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And so it ended up that they kept my connection with this man totally quiet and never - the Nazis never found out about the fact that I had any contact with this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">They were looking for everybody, of course, that they could possibly accuse of accomplice... of being an accomplice. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And nothing ever happened to my parents during that time, but of course I never dared to go back on account of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">However, the day of the trial in the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss Court</span> , my testimony was read and the next day the Nazis came to my parents' <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and searched the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and looked for any kind of evidence that I had been in a political scheme of sorts, or party, or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And that was quite uncomfortable for my parents, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So the idea not to go back was justified and I would have been in trouble very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And in addition to that I probably would have stayed too long - to the point where I would have been deported myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">So in a way, this friend of mine whose name happened to be Frankfurter, by killing this Gustov(ph), saved my life actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I would have probably never gotten through alive otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So he was then sentenced to eighteen years in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> by the Swiss. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Also the Germans, of course, agitated as much as they could and wanted as heavy a sentence as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And he was kept in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> until the day after the Germans surrendered. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">The Swiss let him go the day after <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> surrendered in 45. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">So that was really, for me, a great life saver. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">On the other hand, I was stuck in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> then with no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">All I had with me was one suit and there was things you couldn't... You couldn't send out much money any more - out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> then. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Just a minimum was permissible. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">So I didn't really know where to go next. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Nevertheless, I went to one of the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> - <span class="BUILDING">University Hospital</span> - just to volunteer in order to, you know, be occupied and to at least learn something more after finishing <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And there I had the first, well actually this was the second, remarkable incident that helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">The first one was Frankfurter's murder of Gustov(ph) and the second was that I volunteered at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and, not knowing what to do next and where my next money would come from, one of the residents at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> asked me if I would be willing to help her out because her finance had been a resident at this small <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where the chief had to go to his annual military service. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Every Swiss up to a certain age had to spend three weeks in the military and the chief of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was due to leave and all he had was one resident to care for the eighty patients of this small <span class="BUILDING">district hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And her fiance panicked. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">He ran away, which embarrassed the family terribly, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">He was a nice Swiss boy but I guess he didn't have much guts, and he was afraid to be stuck with eighty patients not knowing how he would take care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So this young lady asked me if I would be willing to take his <span class="NPIP">place</span> because everybody was terribly embarrassed and the doctor, the chief of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , needed somebody to come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So I said, "Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I'd be glad to if I can get permission." </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Whatever you did in those days in these <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> ... If you wanted to work, you had to have a police permit. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So I said, "Well, if I can get the permit, I'd be glad to do it, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">I'd love to." </span><span class="sentence" id="236">So what happened... She got me on the phone. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">The chief of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was at the other end. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">He says, "Well, do you want to take the job?" </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I said, "Sure." "</span><span class="sentence" id="240">Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Such and such a time there's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">You get to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and you come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Choffingen(ph</span> ) and I'll meet you at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I hadn't the slightest idea where it was and I really didn't care either. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I ran to my <span class="BUILDING">rooming house</span> and packed my things, went to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and I got to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Choffingen(ph</span> ) and I left my suitcase at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> because I didn't really believe I could get a job there. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So I walked out to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">It was outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> - a little small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , actually - and the chief met me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">He said, "Okay, here's a white coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Here's a piece of paper and pencil. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">You can speak some Swiss German?" </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I says, "Well, I'll get by I guess." </span><span class="sentence" id="251">He said, "Okay, let's go." </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So he made rounds with eighty patients and he said, "Goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I'l] see you in three weeks." </span><span class="sentence" id="254">So there I was with a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> on my hands and I said, "Well, you've just got to wait a moment and call up the police chief. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I can't just take a job without a permit." </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So he did call the police and says, "Well, I'm leaving for a military service. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I've got to have somebody to take care of my patients. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">You've got to give me a permit." </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And I was able to go to work and manage reasonably well. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And when he came back after three weeks, said "Well, would you like to stay here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I said, "Sure I would." "</span><span class="sentence" id="263">Well," he said, "I'll see what I can do." </span><span class="sentence" id="264">He had some good connections so fortunately he got the permission for me to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">But this had to be renewed every three months - from three months to three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">You had to go through a rigmarole where you had to get permission renewed that you could stay and could work. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So he did that for me and there was no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I got along beautifully there and people were as friendly as you can possibly imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And I enjoyed my work and I made friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">But still it was no solution for me because I knew that wouldn't last. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And sure enough, after a year and a half, the Swiss finally said, "That's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">No more." </span><span class="sentence" id="273">They gave all kinds of reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">First it was the unemployment was too high. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I couldn't stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And then he next thing was the "too many foreigners in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And they gave me a date when I had to leave no matter what. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And they said, "Well, we'll give you three months to figure out where to go and to find some other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but got to leave." </span><span class="sentence" id="279">There was no choice in the matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So that was all fine while it lasted and it was a big help, but.... It was a rare opportunity because very few, if anyone, had been able to work in a foreign country in Europe during those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">But still I then had to look for a more permanent arrangement. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So my next idea was to try to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , which began to take in some of the European Jews, but there were only two ways of entering <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in those days during the British control. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">You had either be a farmer proving that you had so many months of training in farming, or you had to be a capitalist. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">That meant that you had to have a thousand British Pounds in your name on the bank account. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And if you had that, then you could get a certificate from the British to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">On the other hand, this was controlled by the Zionist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">The Zionist organization had available a certain number of these certificates and they could give those certificates to anyone who they wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So the Zionist organization invited me to come to Basel(ph) to appear before the committee and decide whether they would give me that permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">That was the end of 36. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And so when I appeared there they asked me, "Are you a member of the Zionist Organization? </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Do you have any money?" </span><span class="sentence" id="292">So I told them, "I just have those few francs that I earned here 1n the last year, and I'm not a member of the Zionist Organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Observant Jew." </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Zionists are not observant generally. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">They said, "Well, you're not a member of the Zionist Organization, don't have any money -- nothing doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">We will not give you are certificate." </span><span class="sentence" id="297">So that was hopeless. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">So then when I had to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> I had luckily been given a visa to go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Usually they did not give you any visa unless they knew you could go back somewheres else afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">So, somehow or other they did give me a visa to go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> hoping that I would be able to get some type of arrangement where I could go to one of the <span class="REGION">South American countries</span> because <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in those days would not admit anyone that did not have an affidavit of a relative - had to be a relative, and had to be a relative who had sufficient amount of money to be able to guarantee that you would not become a public charge for five years - until you became a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So unless you had a relative, and unless you had somebody that sufficient amount of means, you have no chance of getting a visa to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And I didn't have any relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I knew of nobody at the time and so there was no chance to consider the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> even. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And I went to the various <span class="BUILDING">consulates</span> or <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> of different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in <span class="REGION">South America</span> where you could get a visa depending on how much money you had. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">If you had a lot of money, you could go to <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">If you had a little less, you could go to <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">If you had a little less, you could go to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">But wherever you went you had to pay a fair amount of money to buy a visa and I just didn't have enough for any of those <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">The only one I could afford to buy a visa from would have been <span class="COUNTRY">Venezuela</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">So I started to learn Spanish because you had to take your exam there in Spanish and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And I figured, well eventually that's what I would have to do - go to <span class="COUNTRY">Venezuela</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And I was just living on money I had earned in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> during that year and a half and I was just living on money I had earned in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> during that year and a half which got me by fairly well; not in luxury by any means, but I somehow managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So that process of trying to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> took about six months and, except for <span class="COUNTRY">Venezuela</span> , there was no <span class="DLF">opening</span> that I could have possibly found. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And just at that point my parents who were still living at that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> ... another coincidence... happened to receive a family tree from one of... from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> - from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">One of the distant relatives had gone through the trouble of making a complete family tree of their relatives who went back to the late 1700's, early 1800's, and, lo and behold, in this family tree my father then found his - a cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And so he got in touch with him, and I got in touch with a friend of mine - a schoolmate of mine who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and he started to talk to this relative who was instrumental in bringing quite a few people over, and already had felt that he committed himself to take care of so many people that he couldn't well afford another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">But, eventually he relented and did get me an affidavit, which was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And I very happily took that to the <span class="BUILDING">American Consul</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and he said, "That's fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">But we won't be able to process this until you are... until a certain date at which time your German passport will have expired. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So we can't give you the visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">We have to go and get another passport." </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Well, that was not a small matter in those days either because you didn't trust even the <span class="BUILDING">German Consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">But anyway I got up my courage one day and went there and applied for another passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Miraculously, I came across a fellow who was perfectly friendly, and he said, "How much time do you want?" </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I says, "Well, whatever time - three months would be enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Whatever you can give me." "</span><span class="sentence" id="328">T'll give you a year's passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I don't mind" - and renewed my passport, shook my hands, says, Good luck to you," and I was ready to go to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">So happily I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">United States Consul</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> with my passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">He says, "Yes, well that's fine, but we don't have any quota number for you anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">No quota number now." </span><span class="sentence" id="333">So he said, "We'll let you know when you... when we find another quota number." </span><span class="sentence" id="334">So in the meantime I had to go to the French Police to get a permit every month to stay another month..., another month... until I was able to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And that got - those permissions after, you have to give a puboir(ph) - you know... had a little hand, a little bit under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> to pay for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And anyway, I did get that police permission finally for the... the whole year it took me to finally get the visa to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">So I did get a call after a month or six weeks that they had a quota number for me and I did get my visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">So after one year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> I finally managed to get my visa to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and was able to get a ticket on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and July 4th of 1938 I managed to arrive in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So the worst was over at least at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">However, I had very little luck helping my family - my parents.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="344">ANSWER:  Well, actually, I came over here in 38 and... in July of 1938... and actually all I knew was that everybody was trying desperately to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And in 38 deportation actually hadn't really started yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">People were arrested frequently, but then they were released again. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So I did not know just how bad the situation was. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I did realize, like most everybody else, that one should bring out one's family if it was at all possible, but no details really were known at that time - at least not to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I don't think too many people realized what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And in 38 it really - in the summer of 38 - things weren't as bad because the worst started only after November, 38, when Kristall Nacht occurred - when the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were burned and <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were looted and destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">So this is actually the time when everybody realized they had to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And until then I.... Well, first of all I was busy trying to pass my exams so and do... so I would be able to get the license to practice in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">So I was not as anxious to... about my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I didn't realize how difficult the situation was. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And, actually I had no money either to do much for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">The only financial support I had was a... the money that I received for a camera which I had bought over - one of the - the only valuable thing that I think I remember must have gotten about $250 for it in those days, which was a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And I had to live on that for quite a while before I would have earned anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">So I was handicapped. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I had no relatives here actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">The only one was the cousin of my father's who brought me over - gave me the affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And so I was really handicapped to doing anything, but I did start talking to people to get affidavits for my parents and for my sis.... | had two sisters who had six children between them. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And there I had some distant relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">My brother-in-law had some distant relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">So, trying to get something done as much as possible, but it took me until 1939 to get some relatives to try to get affidavits for them and get them to come over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And actually I had even made arrangements for my parents to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I was able to find somebody who was able to arrange - put some money in their name in a <span class="BUILDING">British bank</span> - again the same old arrangement - so they would come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Then in September, 39, the war started which cut off every possibility for anything - for any of them to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And so that, that was quite a blow. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">As it happened then, my father took ill suddenly in December of 39 and died of a heart attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">They had to give up the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">They had to sell it for a minimal amount to an Aryan, and so they moved to some little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> somewheres. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And with all that I'm sure it was too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">My father was only 67 then and he had a heart attack and died. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">So then I tried to get my mother out at last, and the only way to do that in those days was to get an <span class="DLF">Italian steamship line</span> to take them from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genoa</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santo Domingo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And I did manage to get a ticket on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamship</span> from - to - to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santo Domingo</span> , and hoping that from there I could bring her over to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">So the day came when she should have gotten onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> - taken a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And nothing happened, so I finally, through a sister who was still living then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , one of my sister, I found out that she took ill early in 1940 and had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and never left the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">She had cholangitis, if that means anything to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And there were no antibiotics in those days, so she never survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">So I almost succeeded in getting her out, but didn't quite make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Then, one sister had escaped with her family to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and they thought they were quite safe, of course, until the Nazis took over <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and invaded <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So they were the first ones to be deported to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French concentration camp</span> ; my sister with four children. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">At that time there were... the oldest one was born in 1925, so that was 45, so the oldest one was - must have been seventeen. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">The oldest one, Paul, was sixteen or seventeen. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">The youngest one was just a three years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And they were deported and course, never heard from again. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Her husband had tried to escape to the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and he, of course, was caught by the Nazis as well when they took over the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And the sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> was the one who stayed there the longest. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">She had two girls and also about seventeen and thirteen, and I was able to get in touch with her through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> there for a period of time and she was there when my other died, but she also was deported in 41 - a year after my mother died. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">She was deported with her two girls and never heard from. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">So I had tried hard to get her to come over here and found some of her husband's relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Her husband had died several years before that and they were ready to help with the expense of bringing them over but once the war had started and the <span class="BUILDING">Consulates</span> , both the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulates</span> were closed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as well, that was the end of the - 41 - that was the end of the... any chance of anyone leaving.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">QUESTION:  And during the war itself... So you weren't hearing from them, but you still didn't know then what had happened to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">ANSWER:  Well we knew that.... We knew of the deportation, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">We knew of the deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">As a matter of fact, my sister in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was able to send me her address of this particular camp that she was sent to, but that was the last I heard of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And my sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> - well she I just no longer heard from her. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">We assumed that she had also been sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Still, at this point, one did not know that these people were all killed just as soon as they arrived in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And I never knew where my sister in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> had been sent to. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Later on I seen some of the volumes of former West German citizens that were deported - that the Nazis not the Nazis, but the German Republic, finally West German Republic prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I could find that they apparently were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> , but that was not anything definite.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">QUESTION:  Dr. Meyer was the - He was the head...
ANSWER:  Chief, yea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">QUESTION:  Tell me about your friendship with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">ANSWER:  Well, he was the one friend that really would have liked to keep me there if he could have - if he had been able to who. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">He was a real good Swiss citizen who was - well - connected to the various military people in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and he was just as helpful to me as he could be. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">He, as a matter of... He was... He had to report. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">He had to make an annual report of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And the first year I was there I worked on that report and completed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And then after the Swiss insisted I leave in 37, he had me come back in 38 while I was still in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to make up the next year's - the annual report for the following year - just to help me out and get me a little extra money. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And this was a remarkably fine, fine man, and his wife equally generous and good hearted. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">They would have done anything possible that they could have done to help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">But they too, of course, were limited in their ability to do things. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And after the war we renewed our contact and we visited with them in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> several times after I got settled and was able to afford a trip to Europe which we first did in 1962 - the first time I could manage to get away and take my wife over to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And so this has been a very close friendship. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">They both have died since then, but I'm still in contact with the son of this Dr. Meyer who is a lawyer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417">He has been visiting with us and - in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> at the time and we visited at their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">He still feels very close, though he is thirty years younger than I am, but we are a very close friendship still and he calls from time to time. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">He doesn't like to write letters so he calls from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">So it's quite remarkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And one of the nice things that - when they visited us in <span class="COUNTRY">Maine</span> - was that they came on a Friday and on a Friday night I said to him, "Well, you have to bear with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">We have special things we say or sing on a Friday night to celebrate the Sabbath." </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So he says, "Well I don't know much about it but my wife does." </span><span class="sentence" id="424">She is a Swiss schoolteacher and she spent two years in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> on a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> and she knew more Jewish songs than I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And so they had a great time celebrating the Friday night with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">That was a particularly heartwarming experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">So like everywheres else you find good people, and some that are not quite as good, but it's heartwarming to have this friendship.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I think I've asked you everything that I think is important. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Can you think of anything that I have left out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  Well, the.... My experience in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> was also very wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">When I started out I - being totally alone of course - I only had two old schoolmates of mine I had contact with and who helped me out; one of whom was a dentist who took me in and I slept in his <span class="INT_SPACE">back room</span> in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> for the first few months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> in the - during the hottest months of the year of course - on the bottom of one of those 50 story <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">But that was a big help even at that. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And I use to get by on about $.55 a day of food with horn(ph) for breakfast and lunch, and rolls and bananas for supper. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">It was very inexpensive in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And till I got my first job - when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> I had also spent some of the time in <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> so I would at least learn something and maybe get some connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And one of the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was Hospitale(ph-French) St. Antoinne, and I happened to work in the X-ray Department there. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And the Chief of the Radiology at that time had some contact in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">So after I had worked there for several months - working mean following them around and I wasn't much help I don't think, but I learned something - this Chief of the Radiology Department had a friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">So when I left for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> he gave me a letter along to this particular friend of his and through him I got my first job as a resident in <span class="BUILDING">radiology</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Rochelle</span> , New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Unfortunately, the.... It was a strange situation where the Chief of the Radiology Department at the <span class="BUILDING">New Rochelle Hospital</span> had as his associate his wife and it was not a very healthy situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">There was a lot of friction there. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And I managed to stay there for six months, but after that, that just was a difficult - so difficult - the first and only time I gave up and left there. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">But as it happens, there's another one of those many coincidences that I have to be thankful for. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I found out through a friend I had met in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> that a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> was looking for a resident - a similar situation where a young man had run away because he couldn't stand the responsibility of the work, or the situation, and also about an eighty bed <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for chronic diseases. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And so I heard that this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> needed somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Because that was ... Because in those days, in 1939, - 38, 39 there was a surplus of doctors everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Nobody needed doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">People didn't go to annual checkups. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">People didn't see a doctor unless they absolutely had to and they were very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And doctors couldn't do too much in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">There were no antibiotics and medications were few and far between. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And so it was very difficult to get any hospital appointment, particularly, as I said, there was a surplus and nobody wanted a foreign graduate - a refugee. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">They didn't need them in most instances and they would try anything to get somebody else - an American graduate, rather than to take in a refugee. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">So it was very difficult to get any job. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">So anyway, I did find out about this opening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> and a friend took me up by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">They happened to make a trip anyway from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And so the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> - well, they played a little hard to get at first, but they finally gave me the job which was the first one when I earned $100 a month, which was a lot of money 1n those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And I stayed there for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And during that time I was again looking for an opportunity to practice - to start a private practice because I couldn't stay in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">It was always very protective, but it wasn't - you couldn't earn a real living that way - or support a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">So anyway I stayed there for two years and then looked for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to practice and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> was hopeless like any other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> - any big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Everybody wanted to be in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> then already. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And unless you had enough money to support yourself for two years, you just couldn't even start. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Doctors were a poor credit risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">No <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> would give you a loan. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">So unless you had somebody with money or relatives or family, or good connections, you just couldn't think of starting, particularly around a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So I did talk to some of the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> that <span class="BUILDING">Tufts Medical School</span> - was 1n those days New England Medical Center. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And they said, "Well if we hear of something we'll let you know, but in the <span class="REGION">Boston area</span> there is no place that needs a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">There's just no chance." </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> wouldn't, as a foreign graduate, they wouldn't - weren't too anxious to give you hospital appointments either, even as a visiting or attending physician of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">So it was a very difficult time. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And as I said, the need of doctors was minimal. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">People didn't go for their routine checkups. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">They didn't need doctors that much and there was no army or navy medical corps that needed help. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">The <span class="BUILDING">Veterans Administration Hospital</span> didn't exist in those days, so the number of doctors that were needed was quite limited - was totally different before the war, and there was a total change after the war, when suddenly there was a shortage. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">So finally they called me one day and said, "Well there's a place in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> that needs a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I had no idea where it was or what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">So anyway I said, "Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I'll go and see what the situation is." </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And since I only wanted to go into practice anyway I was able to buy a 1936 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dodge</span> for $300. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">That was a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">It was one of those oil burners. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">We had to stop every hundred miles to fill up the oil... and drove up to <span class="REGION">Maine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> on the <span class="DLF">Canadian border</span> of 900 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And so I drove up there and, sure enough, they needed a doctor badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">There [were] two people that hadn't seen a doctor in several weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">The doctor that they had had left for the army because that was... end of 1940... and he was very happy to find an excuse to leave there. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of 900 - mostly lumberjacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And all said, "Sure you can come. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">We would love to have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">We need a doctor badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">You can rent a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for $20 a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">All you have to do is cut your own wood to heat it." </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And they said, "Well there's an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> here with 300 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">You can take out all the tonsils you want." </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I said, "Well that's too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">That's not my <span class="DLF">line</span> ."... </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Internal medicine, but not in - not in the business of taking out tonsils. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Well, they says, "You can do physicals for the Immigration Service. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">You get $5 for each physical, for every Canadian that comes across the <span class="DLF">border</span> and wants to work in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> has to have a physical." </span><span class="sentence" id="502">So... well.... It wasn't too tempting and I said, "Well, it's too bad I have a New York license, I have a Massachusetts license, but I don't have a Maine license. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">So I would like to accept your offer but I don't think I can take it." </span><span class="sentence" id="504">He said, "Well you go down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lewiston</span> , <span class="REGION">Maine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">They'll fix it up for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">They'll get you a temporary license so you can come up here." </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Well, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lewiston</span> and, fortunately, they couldn't get me a license. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">They had to take a state board first. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">But while they were talking to me they said, "How would you like to stay here for a few months as an intern," after I have been a resident for two years, "and you have a better chance to pass your state boards if you work right in the state. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">You can hopefully do better that way." </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And there was no pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Interns did not get paid in those days - absolutely nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">They got <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board and uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">That was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">So I said, well, it was a very very nice <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I was very much impressed by it and it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of 60,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I figured, well if I get acquainted, maybe that would be a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to settle. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">So I accepted and for six months I worked as an intern again, and took my state board in the meantime - in the middle of a horrible blizzard - but managed to squeeze by. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And so when I finished the six months then as an intern, that was 41, and they offered me to stay as a resident, which again was paid $100 a month which was from nothing quite a bit of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">So I accepted and that was July of 41. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And in December, war started - Pearl Harbor - in December of 41 and quite a few of the doctors left, went in the service, and so the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was very short handed. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And so I stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> of course, and in those days the draft also started and not being a citizen at this point, I would have been drafted as a private. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">So the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> declared me essential. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">That got you out of the draft. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And I stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> until 44 when I got my citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And then I applied for a commission in the service and then I entered the service here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> in August of 1944 - another one of those hot months that I remember vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And I stayed most of my time I spent in <span class="REGION">Alaska</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Handed me a hundred <span class="BUILDING">bed hospital</span> to turn into a <span class="BUILDING">tuberculosis sanitarium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">So that's where a spent the war years - 40, 46. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And then before I left <span class="REGION">Maine</span> they offered me an appointment as an attending at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">So naturally I went back and 48 years later I finally retired. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">But I certainly had a wonderful time there working with the people in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> and taking care of the Maine people - delightful. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">So I... Then I have to tell you how I met my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">That of course is another coincidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">When I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> old friends of mine had been able to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And they're the ones who had arranged for me to have the thousand British Pounds in the bank account, which unfortunately didn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">But I always use to visit them on my day off. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">In those days you worked and had the one weekend off. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And when Gerda was liberated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> where she had spent two years, she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lucerne</span> , which was not very far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And somehow or other she met these friends of mine who had been trying for years to get me married off somewheres. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And when they met Gerda they said, "There's a wife for him." </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Sure enough, after the war in 46 when I got out of the service I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> - had some friends there and visited for the holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And these people from Basel(ph) had also come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">They left <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> finally. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">So there we were - these schoolmates of mine from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> via <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and Gerda came over the same time to visit them. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">So that's how we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">That was still the benefit of our Swiss stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">So that was the good part of the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So I met her in September of 46 and we got married in December of 46, and lived in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> until I retired in 1992. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">So that was a happy ending of the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">But as I said, I was fortunate for myself but I was never able to do anything for my family and that was the only sad part.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I would like to tape some things from your envelope.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">ANSWER:  Start? </span><span class="sentence" id="555">This is my old friend David Frankfurter who studied medicine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> for three years and then went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berne</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> where I met him again when I came there in 1936 after I finished <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And he seemed to be doing quite well although he had been quite sickly at times with osteomyelitis which was not treatable in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And he seemed to be quite himself until one day when he disappeared and turned out to have killed a Nazi organizer in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> - the Nazi organizer who was trying to establish a Nazi Party in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Let me just switch this. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Maybe we'll have to @reframe a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="561">ANSWER:  This was a fellow by the name of Gustov(ph) who went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Davos</span> originally, apparently to treat his tuberculosis and stayed there, and then got himself a job as an organizer for the Nazi Party, and was actually not that well known, but somehow or other Frankfurter had heard about him and determined - was determined to do something to help the Swiss Jewish population by eliminating him. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And indeed he did a great service to the Swiss by taking care of this man.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">QUESTION:  Can you just get a closeup of the name plate below the photograph?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">QUESTION:  You want to kind of move on it, or just...
QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">It's mostly that it's a good thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">You know these are a historical record which helps them check spelling and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And then let's just do... When was that murder?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">ANSWER:  That was in February, 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">QUESTION:  February 4. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">ANSWER:  This is the price list for a visa to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">This was one of the less expensive visas you could possibly obtain. </span><span class="sentence" id="573"><span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> was in the thousands of dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="574"><span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> was a little less. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">But <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> was the only one that was in the hundreds of dollars - only.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  So you could get to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> ... You could buy the visa for $400 to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">This document was the final decision of the Swiss authorities that I had to leave after a certain date when I was no longer needed at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soffingen(ph</span> ), and they decided that they would give me enough time to find another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to go to where I might possibly establish <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> ... but not being specific in any suggestion otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">This 1s the actual certificate which supposedly would have entitled me to practice medicine after graduating from <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> and passing the state board examination. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">But the fact was that soon after 1935 there was already a very definite decree that no Jewish doctor could be allowed to treat any Aryan at any time. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">This was the certificate I recetved after finishing <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> and having passed the state board examination, but it was quite obvious at that time, already, that the law would be that no Jewish physician would be allowed to treat any Aryan at any time, and it was an open invitation to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">QUESTION:  Let's do a close.... Let's just zoom into the date there so we get a... or just to that <span class="DLF">line</span> so there would be a cutting point and then we could use other.... And let's hold on the date. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">That's good. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Great. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Thanks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">ANSWER:  Didn't need it any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">QUESTION:  Tell us about the envelope.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">ANSWER:  This is the official envelope in which my Notice of Departure was sent to me and the very interesting part is that all official Swiss documents included in this envelope are printed in three different languages - German, French and Italian - which makes it remarkable to have these three groups live together in peace and harmony. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">End of Tape #2 Conclusion of Interview </span>
