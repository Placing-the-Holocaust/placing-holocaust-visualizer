<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  Was your family religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> on high holy days and we belonged to a <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , but we were not religious.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Was your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> mixed, or was it a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  The first five years I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Just for Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">It was a regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but just for Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And then I had to go to the regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> from the sixth grade on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  So your friends were both Jews and Christians?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">But mostly Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , do you feel like you lived in a Jewish world, or was everybody pretty well mixed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Pretty well mixed. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , but just through the fifth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">But then it was pretty mixed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  And everyone got along?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  More or less, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I mean there might have been some single people or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">But pretty much okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  Do you remember any antisemitism before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I mean you never trusted everybody, but it wasn't really enticing or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Maybe __ felt it more because he was from a <span class="REGION">German speaking area</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  But it was pretty comfortable?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  For me it was pretty comfortable, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Now, as a girl were you involved in any political organizations or Zionist organizations?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Neither.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  What were you doing at the time of the beginning of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  [had a job with a lawyer who was married to a Jewish woman, so he kept me because he wasn't enticing me and I think he needed me because I knew Czech and German with both shorthand and that was useful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Prior to the German occupation, did you know much about what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  Well we heard about it, but we didn't like it so we didn't want to have it too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Were there refugees coming in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> who told you things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  They were, yeah, but not too many that I was in contact with.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  So you were working at the time when the Germans came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Can you tell me what you remember about that day and when was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  Well we didn't feel comfortable, but since it did not affect me personally, I was pretty indifferent. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">We didn't like it, but since I could go on working and could stay in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we were pretty indifferent; let's put it this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  Naive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  Maybe naive, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Because, as I say, it was hard to believe so; it was easy enough to believe it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  So when did the Germans come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> -- what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  To me personally, not too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">The only thing, I was working for the lawyer and we had German clients. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But they behaved towards me okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">They needed me more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I was working for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I was typing their things because the other girls in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> didn't know how to type German, so I didn't feel too much personally.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  Did the clients know that you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  Yes, most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">The ones we were working with did know it and the new ones, when Germans came, we didn't say it. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">They probably suspected it, but --
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But what I would like to learn more about is -- the Germans occupied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> in March of 1939, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  What happened the day they came in? </span><span class="sentence" id="67">What did you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="68">What was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  They were marching through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Look today. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Let's put it this way, it was simpler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Was it frightening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  Maybe people were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">But I wasn't -- personally, I wasn't too much afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I know I speak German and what can they do to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">If they need something from me they will come, but I think, what can they do to me? </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I was naive, but it was easier to think this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  Were they hurting people? </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Were they beating people? </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Were they shooting -- anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  They might have, but I didn't know it and even if there was something going on close, I probably looked away. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">It was simple.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  And your parents too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  My parents too. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">As long as they let us work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  Now in the beginning did the Germans take any people away or -- you know, like they did in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  They did, but they did not take away people that I knew or that I knew well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  But you knew they were taking people away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">We knew it, but what could we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Not too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">If anything, maybe look away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  Who were they taking away? </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Was it a particular group of people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  I don't know whether it was a particular group. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Someone was in their way or someone wanted his work, or so, they found an excuse to take him away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  So it wasn't rounding up the Intelligencia or something like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  Not really like this, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , at least.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  So after the Germans came in, did they establish a number of rules for the Jewish people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  They might have, but they didn't touch me too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So I didn't care too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">No, they're not against me too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">The rules were not applying to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  Do you remember what some of the rules were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Not really by now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  Did you have to wear a Jewish star?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I wore it in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and when we had no Jewish clients it was covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  Was your father able to continue his work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">He was working on -- he was a salesman and getting commissions, so it wasn't so terrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  And your sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  My sister went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  Were Jewish people allowed to continue studying and in business as a rule?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  Not at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">In business, more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Because it wasn't public so much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  What about --
ANSWER:  I couldn't continue my studies at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  What about continuing to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , that sort of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  Yeah, we could, more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">It wasn't so open.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  So they didn't close anything down.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Not that I know of. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">In some <span class="NPIP">places</span> it might have. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">But not where we went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  One more question about when they were starting to send the people away. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Did you know where they were going, or what was the rumor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  The rumor was that it's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but we wouldn't want to believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I mean, it was unpleasant to believe it, so we just took it -- "What can we do?"</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  Now, did they ever establish in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> sort of a group of Jewish leaders who would help maintain order or anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  They did, but I didn't know them. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">As I say, I was working for a lawyer who was married to a Jewish woman, but it didn't concern him that he is employing me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  So what you're telling me is that for you personally, life didn't change too terribly much?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">For me personally not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  Were a lot of people trying to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  I don't know about a lot, but the ones who had somebody who could help them tried and went. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">But I didn't have anywhere to go, so I didn't even try.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Were people going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  People were going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but I didn't want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I said "I am not Zionist and I don't want to take place of people who belong there". </span><span class="sentence" id="143">It was funny, but that was my etiquette
QUESTION:  So when did everything change for you from this normal life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  I think when they sent me to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  When was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  It was in'49. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">It was pretty early after they came about, I would say about eight months after they came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">But they sent me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> and I didn't believe that's terrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Let me just backtrack a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Now I have a note -- I don't know if this is correct -- that you went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> in December of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Does that sound about right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Also it's a beginning of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , almost.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  They told me be there at 8:00 in the morning on this and this day at the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they assembled us and they registered us and they took God knows what kind of -- take as they wanted from us and they sent us in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and that was it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  Were you with your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  Did they tell you where you were going?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  Well, we heard us go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> and since it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> , we were not so scared.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  Did you take things with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Did they give you any instructions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Well we could take 50 kilo, including our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> spread and these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We took what we could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  What did you take?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  My clothes and -- mostly clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Maybe some food, but not too much because it was heavy and spoiled.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  Do you remember -- I guess at this point you're talking about the German authorities or the Nazi's who were taking care of this process?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  Were they polite to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  I didn't have too much to do with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">They sent me an invitation to be at that time at this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and that was about all. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I didn't try to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I didn't try to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">From today's point of view, it was the correct thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">But at that time we didn't know what was going on anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  Did you and your parents talk about it, do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">We just took it as it came. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">We were simple people.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  Regular. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">At my time we still went in regular, personal <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Not in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle wagons</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  So it all must have seemed somewhat normal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  To me, I never complained. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I did what I was told and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">It was simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">When I came there, there was somebody who I knew, and he said "do you want to work?" </span><span class="sentence" id="192">and I said "what else would I do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="193">and he said "they are looking for somebody in this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> ". </span><span class="sentence" id="194">It was on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And that saved my life, more or less.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  Okay, we'll get to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">When you arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> it was about how far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  What did it look like though?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  Well when I came off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> there was nothing there, and when I came there, there were those <span class="NPIP">places</span> , or how you would call it, and they said "you go into this category, and you go into that one", and I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">They told me you are assigned to this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and it happened to be a small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , we were seven people. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Sleeping on three or four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> from next to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I didn't think too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I just took things as they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">It's silly from today's point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">But I did it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">QUESTION:  I'm just trying to get as much detail as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So you were sent to this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Were you registered first? </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Was there some process, or were you just --
ANSWER:  We were registered before we went onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">You know, so they had all our data already.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">QUESTION:  And you were allowed to keep your regular clothes and wear them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">At that time still, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">QUESTION:  So did you share this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with your parents and other people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  Well my father had to go to the men's thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">The <span class="INT_SPACE">men's quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">But that was in the big what-do-you-call-it -- and I went to the small <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to the small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">We were just seven people in a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> which was an advantage. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">We had three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> and we slept one next to the other, and the three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> filled the whole side of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="290">QUESTION:  Now was this a pretty good job?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">ANSWER:  Considering from today, it was the best I could have gotten because I was more or less protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">They wouldn't send me away because they needed me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">QUESTION:  Did you have access to any special information by working in there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  Once in a while maybe they brought something. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">But I couldn't use it anyway, so I wouldn't say I had a special possibilities or special things.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  Ohyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">But if I could use it somehow -- from today's point of view, I wouldn't be able to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">QUESTION:  Do you remember what kind of information? </span><span class="sentence" id="301">You worked in there a long time, so that's why I'm wondering.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">ANSWER:  Whatever the Germans wanted us to know or to do, we got it first. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I can't remember any more what information was__. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">The only thing I know since I was working there, I was some how protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Not to be sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And since I was married at that time, my parents were protected by me, so they wouldn't be by the terrorists.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">QUESTION:  They didn't divide families on the deportations too much?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  The Jews were mostly putting the transports together, so, you know, this way they did not divide families unless somebody did something that wasn't supposed to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Steal or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">You know, that they found out.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="313">ANSWER:  . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">First it was just the Czech Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And then came the Germans, so the top men were from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">But otherwise --
QUESTION:  So you're saying that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was run really by the Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">ANSWER:  Yeah, but it was pretty well organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I mean, the Germans would talk to it if they didn't like something and give some general orders, but to do it, to comply, it was a Jewish business.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">QUESTION:  And were the Germans around a lot in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">ANSWER:  They had their <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> which were inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">But if somebody saw a German, he tried to go around them as far as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">QUESTION:  They weren't too threatening though?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Maybe someone did something or some of the fellows felt bad, he might have hurt the Jew when he saw him and the Jew did not get out of the way quickly enough, or so, he might have hit him, or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">But not in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Let's put it this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">QUESTION:  So when we're talking about this Jewish administration, what were they 1n charge of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER:  Well, what an administration would do. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">You know, give jobs, or say this and that has to be done, or complied with the Germans order that has to be done, but mostly it was the orders from the Germans that we got, or that they got to comply.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">QUESTION:  You said they were also responsible for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">ANSWER:  Yes and no. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">An order came from the Germans, for instance, on this and this date, one thousand Jews have to be going east. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">We didn't know where east was, or we didn't want to know where east was. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Everybody was afraid that it's worse than from where we are coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And a thousand Jews had to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">No matter what. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And they sent them and we were afraid it's worse -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> we heard some rumors where they are going to, but it was so terrible that nobody wanted to believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Nobody would have believed that there were <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">QUESTION:  Who had to make that list of the thousand people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">ANSWER:  Well the Jews really. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">But they were instructions, for instance, everybody over 55 years, or under 25, or everybody who has done this work, or that work has to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And it was always bad feelings about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Among the Jews too, because everybody thought "1f 1t wasn't for him, I wouldn't have to go" or things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">It was a very sad business.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">QUESTION:  Did that come through your <span class="BUILDING">office</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">ANSWER:  Sometimes, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">QUESTION:  The orders?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">QUESTION:  I understand that within <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> there was a whole court system and everything, is that true?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">ANSWER:  If you want to call it that, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">If someone did something we had a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> and he was set before the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , and was maybe sentenced to spend a few days somewhere locked up, or so, but I don't know too much about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">QUESTION:  What I'm trying to understand is that it sounds like there was this semblance of a whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> - all the regular functions and activities of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Is that --
ANSWER:  Well, as much as the Jews could do it, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">But we were supervised by the Germans and if the Germans didn't like something it couldn't be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION:  Was this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> enclosed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">You couldn't get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">You can flee somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Hide and go somewhere but if they caught us, and where to go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">QUESTION:  Did people escape?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">ANSWER:  A few might have, but 1t wasn't made public.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">QUESTION:  Could you move around pretty much within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">After it was closed, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Before, not. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">We had to have passes to get from one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> to the other or things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">But after it was closed, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">QUESTION:  How soon after the beginning was it enclosed, do you remember’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  I would say about a year, a year and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">As long as they got the non-Jews out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">QUESTION:  So in the beginning there were non-Jews living there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">ANSWER:  Well, they couldn't move everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And those people didn't want to go because they were living in their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , you know, that they owned and they didn't want to leave it. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">So in the beginning there were non-Jews there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">QUESTION:  And then eventually they moved away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">ANSWER:  Yeah, they moved them out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">QUESTION:  So I'm trying to get a picture of this because this is different than many other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Basically, you moved in and took over a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">After a while, not at the beginning, but little by little, and about a year after it was started we had the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">QUESTION:  So all kinds of <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that are in a normal <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">ANSWER:  Not <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , these were big casernan (ph.), </span><span class="sentence" id="383">if you know what I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">So there were some <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and people who were lucky got assigned to live in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> after they evacuated the civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">But that was a big advantage, and they lived in the <span class="INT_SPACE">upstairs</span> without --
QUESTION:  Do you remember some of the leaders of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> 
ANSWER:  I knew them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I was working with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">QUESTION:  Well -- the first one was --
ANSWER:  Edelsteinand _, and then came the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Epstein was the name of the German Jew who took them over. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I mean from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">In the beginning, we were just from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> or from <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> and <span class="REGION">Moravia</span> , but then they came, the ones from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they were assigned the top job, for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">After the Germans came, the top leader was a German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">QUESTION:  What kind of leaders were they; were they good men?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">When they could help they would help. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Otherwise they would have to do what they were told by the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">QUESTION:  In general, did you and the other people living there respect them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">ANSWER:  We did not disrespect them. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">We took them for granted. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Maybe somebody did respect them, you know, one of them or the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">QUESTION:  But there must have been a big difference between the way one would run the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and another one would; there must have been a difference between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edelstein</span> and Mermelstein (ph.)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">ANSWER:  Yeah, but they did not really have to run it by themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">They had to run it together. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Mermelstein we didn't like, but not because he was bad but because personally.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">QUESTION:  Why, what do you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">He was a funny fellow, let's put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I couldn't say why. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I, personally, didn't like him. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">That's for sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">QUESTION:  Were they corrupt?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">ANSWER:  I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">They couldn't have been too much corrupt if they accepted from somebody something sometimes, it's possible, but there wasn't too much to be corrupted by.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">QUESTION:  Did you have any contact from the outside world? </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Did you have radios or letters?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="437">QUESTION:  Was there a lot of industry, I mean, was there all kinds of different work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">ANSWER:  It wasn't all kinds of different work, but they came -- some of the Germans wanted to have something done for himself maybe even. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">So he supplied the means.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">QUESTION:  Was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> making things for the war effort or was it basically trying to keep itself going?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="446">ANSWER:  He was a chief physician and I met him and we liked each other and he had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for himself, so it was much more comfortable to live together and then, officially, I had my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> three <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> away from him, but we lived together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">QUESTION:  And?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="468">ANSWER:  We figured that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">The only thing is that they sent him away and I wanted to go with him, but he knew more than I. He was going to go not to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And he didn't want, as he said, three people on his conscience because my parents would have had to go with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">His mother had to go too when he was sent.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  He was a leading physician; he was the chief physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">But ask what you want to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">QUESTION:  Was there a big medical operation there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">It was pretty big. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">There was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">There was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there before and they turned it over to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">So at the regular <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> we had good physicians. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Better than on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">QUESTION:  A lot of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">ANSWER:  Enough, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Some of them were sent away or some attorney was sent away and they went with them, but we had -- considering what were, and where we were, we had lots of physicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">QUESTION:  What about medical supplies and equipment?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">ANSWER:  The Germans wanted -- were afraid if something breaks out in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> it will go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and they will be affected. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">So they supplied us this equipment and these supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Medicines and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Not because they liked the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">They liked to help the Jews, but they were afraid for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">QUESTION:  Was there a lot of illness at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">ANSWER:  Comparatively not. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Because the Jews took care of themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">But there was, of course, you know, enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">QUESTION:  Was there disease? </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Did people die there?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION:  No <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> ?</span></p>

ANSWER:  Whatever they could find. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">The family made some arrangements. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">It was a <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">They found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to bury them or so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">QUESTION:  I understand that there were a lot of different specialists in the medical community. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Did they take all kinds of operations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">ANSWER:  Operations -- no, they put the Jews -- the Jewish doctors were there, so there were all kinds of specialties. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And if they could make an operation, if the doctor would think it would be good and he could learn something from it too on top of it, he would do an operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">We got the supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">The Germans gave us supplies because they didn't want an epidemic. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">They were afraid for themselves, mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Not for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">But, you know, how can you confine an epidemic in a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">QUESTION:  Did the Germans get treated by these Jewish doctors also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">ANSWER:  Notas arule, but some of them preferred them from the German doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">They came on the Sly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">QUESTION:  Were there a lot of nurses?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">ANSWER:  Well, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">As many as we needed were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Some of them came as nurses and some of them learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">QUESTION:  And your husband basically ran the whole operation or he actually worked on patients.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">ANSWER:  Both. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">He worked on patients whom he knew and who he could treat. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">But normally he was assigned to people to treat or to work in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> or that. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">We had more doctors than we needed and we had better doctors than the people <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Let's put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Because we had doctors who were something and somebody before they came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">QUESTION:  Did your husband ever talk to you about special concerns with what he was trying to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">ANSWER:  Yes and no. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">We all felt -- everybody feared to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> because everybody was afraid it's worse than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">How much worse and how much other people knew than I did, I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">QUESTION:  But did he talk about special problems in even running the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , or things he needed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">ANSWER:  It was running by itself more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">We had more doctors than we needed and better doctors than they had on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">QUESTION:  Now what about -- I would think for some people maybe they would need some kind of social -- psychiatric counseling. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Was that ever done there. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I don' know whether it was done as, you know, just to help to it as specialty or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">But there were people who did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">They were doctors who did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">It was for their own better. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">You know, so to be able to practice and to see how it works.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">QUESTION:  It was also a bit of a <span class="BUILDING">laboratory</span> is what you're saying?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">We had better doctors than the people on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Let's put it this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">QUESTION:  Do you remember whether there was much of a problem with suicide?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I mean, I don't remember, but I don't think there were many people who committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">There might have been some.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">QUESTION:  You had mentioned the Germans coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Tell me a little bit about who were the other prisoners or inmates or whatever you want to call yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Who you were. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">It started off with people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and --
ANSWER:  Well, I was working for a lawyer and he kept me for as long as they let me work. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">As long as I was someone to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">So I wasn't affected too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">But I know that many people could not work any more because the employers didn't want to be accused that they were helping Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">QUESTION:  This was back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="570">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">QUESTION:  Okay, but when you went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , at that time it was mostly Czech Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Mostly, but then they started to send people from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And even from the ones that were in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Some people succeeded to get out to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and when they got hold of them, they took them also.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  So all these different groups that came in, was everybody mixed together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  They tried to stay together. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">The groups that came in tried to stay together because they knew each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">But how long could they stay -- they sent half of them or how many out of the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">They were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> wasn't such a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="581">QUESTION:  So you all had to mix together eventually?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">QUESTION:  Now when the Germans and Austrians arrived -- you don't remember when that 1s, do you?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="587">ANSWER:  They had different expectations, and it went even that far that even some time or one time a German said "if our Fuhrer knew how you treat us, if our Fuhrer". </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Because they thought, you know, since they are Germans, Hitler would take care of them better than of the Czechs. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">But that was what some of them said, "1f our Fuhrer knew".</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">QUESTION:  How did the Czech people react to the Germans who came in -- what did they think of them? </span><span class="sentence" id="591">How did you feel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">ANSWER:  We took them for granted. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">They came the same as we, and the German Jews, they expected to be treated better which is true because "our Fuhrer", but they were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And they got assigned the same as the others and then came an order, a thousand Jews have to go, so how do you select a thousand Jews and don't make a mistake, let's put it this way, or what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">QUESTION:  Were there ever tensions between the Germans and the Czechs and the people from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">ANSWER:  Oh, sure, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">From <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , not. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Dutch people were nice, but the Germans were saying to the Czechs, "1f our Fuhrer knew how you treat us", that you don't treat us better. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">That was tensions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">QUESTION:  Did that cause problems?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">It caused problem not to me personally, but I am sure there were bases where it was a problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">QUESTION:  And didn't some Danish people also come?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">ANSWER:  They were separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">They were not allowed -- <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> -- since they had to go they made a rule that they may not be sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they even got them out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> shortly before the war ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Because they were working for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">They were our citizens and we were responsible for them and they were protecting them. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I mean, there were not so terribly many, but <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> took care of their Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="609">QUESTION:  Were there a lot of children in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">ANSWER:  Well, the regular family has children and they were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">The children came along. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And there were children born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">QUESTION:  That was allowed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">ANSWER:  That was allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Well what can you do. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">We were human beings, and what can you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I mean the people who had them were human beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">QUESTION:  But the Germans allowed children to be born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="619">ANSWER:  Once they were born they didn't do anything to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">They didn't like it, but what could they do? </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Sometimes they sent the parents with the children, but that wasn't as a rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">QUESTION:  So women were getting pregnant in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">QUESTION:  And that was allowed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">ANSWER:  It wasn't allowed officially. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">When she wanted to have an abortion, she could have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And if she did not, they didn't do too much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">QUESTION:  So they didn't force women to have abortions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">ANSWER:  No, not really, but who wanted to have a child in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">So most of them did have abortions on their own really. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">On their own will.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">QUESTION:  Did you ever get pregnant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">ANSWER:  Did the children live separately?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">ANSWER:  Sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">They had some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> where they had the children separately if the parents were working, both of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And sometimes no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">QUESTION:  I understand that when the Germans came in, the Austrian Jews, they sent a lot of older people, a lot of people from <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Is that true?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">ANSWER:  Well they sent the other ones to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">So what they had to send the usually sick or older people. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">It came by itself, let's put it this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">QUESTION:  That probably changed the balance in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in terms of working people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="643">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">But as I say, they came from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> or so, and they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">The people who work they were sending to work and the older people remained and they sent them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">QUESTION:  When they began deporting when they'd make the list of a thousand Jews, or whatever, to the east, were there certain categories of people who went first? </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Did they send --

<p><span class="sentence" id="651">ANSWER:  The same. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I mean they said over 65 whether they were female or male, it didn't matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">QUESTION:  What I'm wondering is if they would keep the men around longer because they thought they were better workers or something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">ANSWER:  They might in some cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">If somebody knew something special they wouldn't let him go because they needed his work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">QUESTION:  Did you feel that women were treated the same as men there?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="673">QUESTION:  And they had special privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="674">ANSWER:  Not special privileges, but they lived in better <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">They had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> assigned where they lived together more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">To be available when the Germans wanted something from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Some advice or so.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="800">ANSWER:  Clean up everything and they gave us some things to show like some more food or some things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">But unfortunately they did not come to often, and because what they gave us they took it then away -- they gave to one <span class="NPIP">part</span> and they took it away from the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="802">QUESTION:  Who were these visitors?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="839">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> to the east of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Extermination camps</span> where they didn't have to have anything extra.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Were the supervisors or the guards when you were working -- they mostly treated the people pretty well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="848">ANSWER:  Regularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">They didn't beat us unless somebody did something. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">They didn't do too much bad things to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Because they were afraid if we should survive they might get it after it.</span></p>

QUESTION:  He didn't share a lot of that with you though?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="873">ANSWER:  Well I think I knew about everything, but the Germans didn't know how much I knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="874">QUESTION:  So you did know what was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="875">ANSWER:  I knew more or less what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">I mean, I didn't want to believe what I heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">That's another thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">They were saying they put people in <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and they killed them there or God knows what. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">But it couldn't be true. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">It was so horrible that it couldn't be true in my way of thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="881">QUESTION:  This relationship must have really helped you cope with your life there a lot better?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="882">ANSWER:  Oh, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">First of all, I had somebody whom I loved. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">Since he was the leading physician he had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for himself which I could share with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">I had an extra <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> to move away, but I could share the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with him so I can't compare my life with anybody else's.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="886">QUESTION:  Towards the end were there a lot more deportations out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="887">ANSWER:  I think so because they tried to get as many people away so they wouldn't have so many people to tell about them; you know, about the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="888">QUESTION:  So it was more regular?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="902">QUESTION:  What did they look like?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="910">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">We had to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">They gave us sometimes not too much, but we had our meals and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that they showed off how well they treat Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">QUESTION:  That's why I was wondering, because it would seem that the people who came from the east must have looked very different from you people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">But as I say, by the time they came, they had something to eat or the Germans let them eat some. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">But I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">I came there early and someone who knew me said "do you want to work" and that saved my life and my parents survived with me which was unusual, but thank God.</span></p>
