<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  -- in that I just want to acknowledge the importance, and I want to say thank you to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> for doing this, because I have believed for some time that the archiving of this information is extremely important. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">And I’ve said publicly, privately, that even though every interviewee’s information, including mine, may not be earth-shaking, or startling, the fact that it’s archived, and the technology is available to do it, is terribly important. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">How interesting it would be if I go to the -- whatever <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , take out a tape of a Civil War soldier, talking from the Civil War, not a mere reenactment, and we could learn so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">So I just want to acknowledge, and extend my appreciation for whoever sponsors this, and for the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> for doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I do understand now this has been now going on for maybe 10 years, these second interviews. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I really thought it was a brand new idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">But I’m delighted to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Let me get to the question that you asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I don’t know if I’ve learned anything specific. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Much of what I know about the Holocaust, I know from -- from memory, and I’ve said before now, and I’Il repeat -- Ill try not to repeat myself too frequently, to say that I was old enough to remember, because my memory apparently works well, and much too young to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Which makes yo -- me a survivor whose emotional scars are quite different than people my age, and two, three, four years older, who in fact understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I thought I was being a little pint sized hero for wearing a yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I didn’t think it was a stigma. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I couldn’t understand the concept of stigma. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I mean, I too have, like an adult, that’s a good thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">All six year olds want to be like big people. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So it isn’t so much that I’ve learned a lot, although I’m sure I’ve learned certain things about myself, my father, my mother, and others, what I’ve done the last 14 years different than before, and it’s not because of the interview, was I be -- have become very much more involved in Holocaust kinds of things, in order to make use of the survivors, because we are a dying population, and I can identify for you -- and again, I don’t think I did before, that the night that Steven Spielberg -- that’s a matter of just a coincidence, received the Academy Award for Schindler, he said that there are, at that time, as I think he said, 350,000 survivors, I guess, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And I was flabbergasted because in relative terms, it’s a very small number. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I mean, 350,000 people, and that’s a dozen years ago, whenever that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So there are less today. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And I said maybe I need to, in some way be involved, because I’m one of the younger survivors you’!] </span><span class="sentence" id="22">meet -- I’m only 67 years old, do something to archive, to use, to teach, because if we don’t, this is an -- this 1s an irreplaceable commodity. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">If we don’t do what we need to do, after we’re gone, it can be done, but differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">A second generation experience is different than the initial experience that those of us who were there, 1n all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> , can tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So I’ve become involved in a number of things, but I think that’s the major change, since that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Not so much what I’ve learned, but what I’ve done with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Do you want to talk about some of things you’ve done?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  Well, I have probably spoken in a -- in a gazillion <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I’ve been involved locally with the Jewish [indecipherable] Council, which sponsors an annual Yom HaShoah commemoration that’s six, seven, 800 people, attendance thing, and all the largest <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community,</span> I’ve chaired it for the last five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And I did -- I’ve been a member of that commission for 15 or 18 years, but I thought maybe I’d like to become more involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And that involves with some other elements of the Holocaust thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Serve the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , museum visits, museum volunteering, some other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I have some connection with the legislature, as a consequence I’ve tried to help the council, and the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> be involved with legislators to come to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , or to meet them there, or to speak with them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">These are things I’ve done, I’ve -- anecdotally, one of the things I’ve done is our organizations that have silent auctions, I’ve been a silent auction museum tour giver in any number of organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">If you bid on my particular offer, and it’s a winning offer, whatever the organization decides, I will in fact take a half a day, and take you and four other people to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and the most interesting group I had once, was a -- a woman, I forget what her organization was, she called, and we arranged, and there were four women, and I, all veterinarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I don’t think they were Jewish, but they were involved in some organization, and they wanted to see the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and I was there with four veterinarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I had never been with that many veterinarians in my life, women or otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Just an interesting combination of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  I’ve done that, I have probably been involved in the -- in a -- to a greater degree in the three organizations that are Holocaust organizations in the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">There is the Washington fre -- th-the survivors and friends organization, with which you may be familiar. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">There 1s a child survivors organization, which covers more Baltimore/ <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , and there’s a second generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And now there 1s a third generation organization, and I have gotten to know some of the people, I’ve been involved in some of the meetings, some of the planning, some of the conferences.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">That’s quite a lot, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And do you talk with the schoolchildren? </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Have you done any of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  Well, for example, recently there was a cooperative program within the council and Comcast, and the [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">Olney theater</span> , here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olney</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And several <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> classes were brought -- several <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> , and they [indecipherable] 11" grade class, were brought together for a -- an orientation, a talk, a -- a video, and after that they even did projects expressing the Holocaust in art, music and design. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And we spoke to those four <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">The next year, there were four other <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">These have been things that I’ve done. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">There was a training program, for example, for the Jewish Social Service Agency, JESSA, and five years ago, I think it was, when we spent four days, one day a week in four weeks, in a very comprehensive training program for their staff, including a visit to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , which I, as a volunteer put together for them, with a director of the agency, and it was a pretty successful thing involving all of their people, on the assumption that if they deal with Holocaust survivors, they ou-ought to know something about the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Is it possible for you to summarize what -- how people react to your presentations when you meet with them? </span><span class="sentence" id="56">People who may not know a lot about the Holocaust? </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I’m talking about groups aside from survivor groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  React in what way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  How do they react? </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I mean, what do they want to know, what -- what do they not know? </span><span class="sentence" id="61">What does it --
ANSWER:  Well -- there are probably at least two major kinds of presentation, and I do one because I’m unable, or whatever to do the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">The -- those presentations which are based in the emotional experience, but as I said to you, my emotional experience at the time was very limited, I didn’t understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So what I do is I do a much more -- not objective, but I guess it’s an objective approach to describing what happened, from the eyes of a six, seven, eight, nine, 10 year old kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">The reaction to that often is amazement, to the point, and this is again anecdotal, but I spoke to whatever, the fifth grade Hebrew school class of my <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And the fifth grade Hebrew school class, one of them, included my grandson at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And he asked a question at the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And he became so kind of involved in the description, he said, “Did you survive?” </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I’m his grandfather, I mean, he was like trying to ask, how did people survive, so he said to me, “Did you survive?” </span><span class="sentence" id="69">He’s forgotten, I mean, this could have been a movie that I was describing. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So the reaction tends to be less visceral in some sense, and more factual, because I tend to present factually, rather than emotionally, for many reasons, including the kind of person I am, and the nature of my experience, of people that I know in the community who are one, two, three, four, five years older than I, whose experience was different as a consequence, they present differently.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">That’s interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Let’s g -- let’s go back to your chronology, if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">It was 1949 when you came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with your mother and father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  Mm, well, my father came in 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  Oh, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  My father -- we were all in, at that time, <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> happened a few months after my father left. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">My father came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> for two reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">One stated, and one kind of unstated. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">The stated reason was, of the seven children, six siblings and my father, two had died in 1930 of causes other than Holocaust, two women, one married, one unmarried. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Two brothers were killed during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">One brother was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , my father, and the seventh child, the oldest, was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">My aunt had come here in 1914, in some ways to be with some cousins, to reduce the burden, which was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">My grandparents -- my grandfather, I am told -- I never met him, he died before I was born, again for non-Holocaust related reasons, he died 1930. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">He was not a successful businessman, and they had some very difficult times. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">He became a -- kind of a county clerk of some sort, because he could read and write, and he knew Hungarian well, besides Yiddish and Jewish things, and it was difficult to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So my aunt came out here. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">My father wanted to see his surviving sister, whom he had not seen since 1914 when he was eight -- no, he was 10, and she was 14 or 15, or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">The other reason was that my father, being a professional cantor all his life, trained as a cantor, not just something he did part time, found that 1t was very difficult to make a living, because that’s one of the things <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> did not need too many of at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And he chose to -- he found a way to legally stay, he did, and then in ’49, my mother and I came. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Now we’re in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">What do you remember getting off -- you were at <span class="BUILDING">Idlewild Airport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">What do you remember when you came in, and what were your expectations of the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I honestly had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Remember that being of that age, and at that time, the number of movies that people saw -- I mean, movies were a -- a treat number one, and they were infrequent. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And when I lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , went to the movie, and I can tell you the names of the <span class="BUILDING">movie theaters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">But they were movies from various <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and I didn’t -- I didn’t have an understanding of what the size of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , the dimensions of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , the opportunities of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> were, and I’m not sure that’s something that a ni -- nine year old would -- well, by that time I’m 13, but even a 13 year old wouldn’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">My orientation was much more in terms of European recollections of things, and certainly this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> did not appear to be the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I was fascinating by- first I came by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Now, I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> in a -- what had been a <span class="BUILDING">military airport</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> , two engine <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , flew to -- for refueling in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , for refueling in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunis</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunis</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Spent overnight in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> took the big bird to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shannon</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gander</span> , in <span class="REGION">Newfoundland</span> , and then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">That was the typical way, but it was by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">My father had come the year before, it took him three weeks, I think, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">But it was just a question of how people traveled. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So you arrive at this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and I remember waking up in the morning after an overnight flight, and my first inclination was, as I looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> , was to get out and walk, because the clouds looked like sheep. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">They looked s -- as solid as rocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Now I knew that that’s not a good idea, and I didn’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But it was uneventful flight of -- probably the hop from Shannon to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gander</span> must have been 10 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gander</span> down, another six. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">We traveled probably 30 hours all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">But we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Now, you have to remember that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Idlewild</span> , which we now know as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">JFK</span> didn’t look the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">It was kind of a little <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , because international flights had not been too common, one because the war had just ended, and two, that was not the kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jets</span> hadn’t come in, not for another 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  And the prop-driven four engine planes had to make hop, to hop, to hop, to hop. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It was still quicker than <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , but -- so we arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Now, at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , my father and my aunt, his sister, were waiting for us, and in a matter of minutes, it seemed, we were kind of hustled by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> -- that was not unusual, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxis</span> I knew, to <span class="BUILDING">Pennsylvania station</span> , 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , where we spent some time kind of getting acquainted. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And I remember seeing a sign on the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> between <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> and <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trenton</span> , which I couldn’t read then, but I had taken that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride subsequently many, many times, and it says <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trenton</span> makes, the world takes. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Took me years to figure out what that meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">But it was one of the initial things. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">In those days when you went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , or you went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> , you had these various dispensing machines, much less sophisticated than what we have now. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I was absolutely fascinated by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gum machine</span> , where you could put in a nickel or whatever, couple pennies, and get Chiclets. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And I wanted to kind of do it all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I was fascinated by Venetian blinds. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I was fascinated -- certainly by television set, which my aunt had, as I remember, but we didn’t for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Now, radios were not unusual, radios were common. </span><span class="sentence" id="130"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Cars</span> were not unusual, although the number were common. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So that the impressions you had -- what I had is twofold, what Ill leave you with. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">One, the impressions of a 13 year old in a new <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And the impressions of a 13 year old in a new <span class="NPIP">place</span> called the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I knew very little about the States yet, at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I didn’t begin to know about until we moved back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , after about two weeks of staying here, and my parents took a <span class="INT_SPACE">sublet apartment</span> , and I began to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And I s -- we spent a year and a half in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for about a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I came here in what would be equivalent to seventh grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So I finished seven B in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , in those days with A’s and B’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Did eight A in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I can tell you about that, too, because it had impact, a significant impact. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And then we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> where my father lived the rest of his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">My mother died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , and I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> until 1961, till I finished <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> , and then my wife and I, and daughter at the time, left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  Tell me about going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  Well, the point of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was that -- people think this is just words, but <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> are the Mixmasters of society, particularly in a place like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Now, my father found a <span class="INT_SPACE">sublet apartment</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Remember, my father’s congregation was on the east side of <span class="DLF">Rivington Street</span> , had to be walking distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Even though he performed in that congregation only once a month, it’s that kind of job. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Still had to be walking distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">During -- on other Sabbaths, we went to some <span class="BUILDING">local synagogue</span> , a small one, whatever, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">But we are on -- on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in the <span class="REGION">west side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We are in the heart of the famous part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , <span class="DLF">Bleeker Street</span> , <span class="DLF">McDougall Street</span> , and we were on <span class="DLF">Barrow Street</span> , 72 Barrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">An <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> where people were away, and we sublet their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155"><span class="BUILDING">School</span> became an important thing, obviously, and my father made some inquiries, I suppose, he was not familiar, for me to go to one of the Jewish-type day schools. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And there were many of them in the general community, subway rides. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And I remember going to them, and I remember that one of them, I forget the name, insignificant, said, “We will be glad to have the young man,” -- I mean, I was fluent in Hebrew -- “we’ll put him in third grade.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="158">Why?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="159">Well, he doesn’t speak English.” </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Which is true. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I had some knowledge of English, but very spotty, and very unreliable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  And either of your parents speak English?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  Well, my father had been here for a year, and he spoke some. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Again, street English, learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">My mother didn’t, she knew less that I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">My mother, by that time, spoke Hungarian, Serb, passable German. </span><span

not taught in Europe when they were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I knew very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I mean, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trenton</span> makes, the world takes, I could not read, then. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I was 13, I was not, you know, an infant. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">But there was something about the notion of third grade that didn’t make any sense for many reasons, not only the fact that I’d lose four years, I could probably make them up, but a 13 year old is not going to have anything in common with a nine year old, or a 10 year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">There’s a difference, I mean, raging puberty was probably taking place, and all those other things that happen in early teens were taking place, and that did not put me into any kind of a connection with the younger kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So my parents, somehow, and I don’t recall -- I don’t -- I can’t remember how they discovered that the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> happened to be exactly a block from the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">P.S. number three, on <span class="DLF">Hudson Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">The principal was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I’m not sure that’s terribly significant, but there may have been some -- I had with me a letter from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> , saying that I had completed so much of seventh grade, but the curriculums are different. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">The principal said the following, he said, “We’ll put him in seventh grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">We'll give him an allowance, he will not have to take classes in Spanish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Which was already being taught. “</span><span class="sentence" id="181">If he makes it, he’Il go to eighth grade, and if he doesn’t, he’Il repeat seventh grade, it’s pretty simple.” </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Which made an awful lot of sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And obviously I was able to pick up enough to begin to go on, and kids, first of all, are spongelike, and you pick up. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And one of the differences between me and people who are three or four years older, who came here maybe after <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , or at the end of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , you have different language pattern, you have a different knowledge of English, and people after 50 years, still speak like they got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I never did a thing in my life to try to deal with the way I spoke, but I tried to learn the language as well as I could, so I have command of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">In P.S. number three, I could do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And that had significant impact in that I continued, at least age appropriately, as opposed to continuing in a way that was, you know, kind of as a sore thumb sticking out, a kid two feet taller than everybody else in the class, cause I was 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">So that had very significant impact. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Then I continued through <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , and that’s -- we’ll get to that at some point if you wish, but that had an important element. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">My father then decided that although he could have stayed at that congregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , I guess indefinitely -- well not indefinitely, but certainly for awhile, cause community had begun to change in some ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">He thought that he would like to live in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community,</span> so his wife and son could

ANSWER:  No, because the kid next to me was from <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> , and the kid next to him was from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and the kid next to him was from some Spanish speaking -- and I remember vaguely these two kids, the Italian and the -- I don’t even know if it was a Chinese youngster, but he’s certainly an Oriental kid, he could have been Korean, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">But he came -- he wasn’t in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Next day he comes in, and I say to him, “Where were you yesterday?” </span><span class="sentence" id="196">He says, “I played hooky.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="197">Oh,” I says, “with a stick?” </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I didn’t know the word hooky, but I learned the word hooky from my Chinese friend, who was playing hooky, okay?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="218">ANSWER:  It -- 1t was -- 1t was my some sense of freedom, and I could do anything I pleased. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I didn’t have a large number of friends at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Little later on, when we moved to the East Side, because we went into an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where we stayed for the rest of our time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , which was an old brownstone on 11" Street. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I had two or three friends that I had some contact with, but we went to different <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And life tends to be mostly going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and having a little bit of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And again, 50 years ago, the kind of freedom, I mean, none of the kids went for vacations in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Lauderdale</span> , at least not then, and I was too young to do that on my own anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">But we went -- <span class="DLF">14" Street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> was still a major demarcation line between the lower East Side, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">lower Manhattan</span> , on -- further up. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And we went to all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I remember taking -- taking -- I asked my parents to go to the movies with me, which they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And we saw two and a half hours of cartoons. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And I still don’t know how they survived that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="232">ANSWER:  No, it’s not the work, the work was very much what he wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Community in that sense meant having friends that you could live in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> with, shopping that you did in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> when you knew the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , organizations where you got involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="234"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> is not that kind of a community. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">In a peculiar way, neither 1s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">But the cities of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , and so forth, have histories as -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> -- are communities. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">There are certain rules about them, there’s certain elements, and certain ebb and flow to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And that’s what I meant he wanted a community. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">The position in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , the job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , was a star position. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I mean, this was the -- not quite, but it was the Metropolitan Opera version of the cantor at the -- the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I mean, you appear once a month, and the rest of the time you can do anything you damn please. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">But he wanted to be based in someplace where he has some bricks, and some mortar, and some other kinds of roots that he can sink -- having now started his career for the third time.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  Tell me briefly, and then we can go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">ANSWER:  For whatever it’s worth, the cantor of the day was not a recognized minister of religion, the rabbi was. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Rabbis had non-quota entry possibilities in terms of the Walter Maccaren Immigration act. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">A rabbi could come here, non-quota, bring his family, a cantor could not. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">My father had been ordained as a rabbi twice in Europe, at very respected ye -- <span class="BUILDING">Yeshivas</span> , one of them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , well known. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">It was never done for professional reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">It was not at all unusual to have somebody become a ordained lawyer, physician, businessman, accountant, bookkeeper or chemist. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">In his <span class="DLF">field</span> it wasn’t a bad idea to have that kind of background. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">My cousin -- my aunt’s son, who was a Philadelphia lawyer, with all the terms that that means, was able to research the law, and was able to find that as a ordained rabbi, no matter what he does for a living, he could enter non-quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">The rabbi of the congregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , eventually gave him a position of being the associate rabbi so he could come. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">So I’m saying that that’s how he could stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and this happened before we arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">How he got the job originally was that on a recommendation, he was asked to do a particular piece of -- of the liturgy, which happens once a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">It is called the Yom Kippur cattan. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">It is a -- every month there is a Yom Kippur that’s done -- not any more, but it used to be, and he performed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">He performed it as a volunteer, he performed it because somebody said, “Hey, you ought to listen to him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And on that basis they decided to offer him position. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I think he performed in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> as well, but he was able to get that without much difficulty, and as far as the job was concerned, and the income, that was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It was the community that was missing, and that was se -- that was given, or that was made available by the existence of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> -- remember, I had an aunt, an uncle, three cousins, and their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So that came with an instant kind of a set of roots.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">So the transition to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> was not difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">For me the transition to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> was not difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Certainly 1t was an easier transition than the previous several. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">You know, from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">That was much more difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">But no, I met Sa -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B

ANSWER:  That I met some friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , in s -- in eighth grade, and one of them -- a couple of them, but really one of them 1s still my very best friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Unfortunately he lives on the <span class="REGION">west coast</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">He’s a retarded pe -- a re -- retarded -- he’s a retired pediatrician. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And Bill and I keep in close contact, and we expect to see him later this month, we’re going to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> , and they were here last month. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">So, that’s a friendship that’s 50 years old, and we maintain it as well as we possibly can. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And there were others, the other -- typically in 50 years, you’re not going to maintain your whole <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> class. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">But the transition to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philly</span> , to the best of my recollection, from that point of view, was easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">There were some other things that were difficult, probably with my educational background, and in some ways the lack of it, and what I saw probably subconsciously as my -- as my targets in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Want me to continue on that direction?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">QUESTION:  Yeah, tell me about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">ANSWER:  Came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> -- came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , did okay in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , nothing unusual, however, interestingly, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> in which I lived, and for Philadelphians, all I have to say, I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Logan</span> , and I eventually went to <span class="BUILDING">Central High School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Now, that’s a whole thing by itself, and that’s a keyword to anybody who knows <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">If you don’t, it doesn’t matter, and if you do, that’s a -- it’s the origin of the <span class="BUILDING">magnet school</span> idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">It’s a city-wide school [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">That <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> was equidistant to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to the zoned high school that everybody from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> went to. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">My friends went to Central. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">They left <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> -- in those days <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> ended in ninth grade, I went to -- or eighth grade, but you could stay for ninth. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">You could start <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ninth or tenth. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">That’s significant, as I recall -- as I think back, that my friends went -- the two or three friends that I maintain contact with, went from Jaku Junior High School to Central in ninth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">The counselor at that <span class="BUILDING">yunior high school</span> , Mr. Cotler by name, in his attempt to be kind and to be nice, said to us, “I would recommend that he go to <span class="BUILDING">Central High School</span> , but next year. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Ninth grade would be good for him in <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> , because let’s face it, his English is not as perfect, his writing is not as perfect, I mean the kid has been here for a year.” </span><span class="sentence" id="298">It was one of the largest mistakes I ever made.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">QUESTION:  Why’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">ANSWER:  Because the whole style of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was formed in ninth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">When I arrived as one of maybe two or three newcomers to that class, to the 10" grade class, I was one of two, or three, or four kids who joined in 10" grade, everybody else was in ninth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And the adjustment, and the academics -- strictly <span class="BUILDING">academic high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">We had no non- academic course, it was the original <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> wi -- where the Ford program, which later became the accelerated program, was introduced. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I had major difficulties for two reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I think it took me awhile to catch up, and I spent <span class="BUILDING">summer schools</span> in <span class="BUILDING">summer school</span> because I had to make up one course or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And secondly, I was very concerned- not in a conscious way, of fitting in. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">As a consequence, the social and the -- not just social in terms of social with -- it’s a all boy’s high school, none of us minded that. </span><span class="sentence" id="308"><span class="BUILDING">Public school</span> , all boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">It’s a whole other story. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">But the point is that I -- none of us missed the girls, so it wasn’t just a social with girls that we were trying to deal with at 14 and 15, which 1s the appropriate time to do that, but the other social things that take place among boys, [indecipherable] concerning sports, concerning various kinds of things that boys begin to become involved with, quite appropriately, was important for me to be part of. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Well, you could only do so many things in 24 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">As a consequence, I think that I would have had a -- an easier <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> career had I gone during ninth grade, and if I wasn’t so conscious, at least subconsciously on adjusting to become one of the gang, where I didn’t do anything to become one, but it was certainly a drive, because I had recently been elsewhere, and I’d recently been different, quite different. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And I -- I want to be sure that I say that in terms of my own experience, I wasn’t concerned about doing this in any conscious way, but I’m absolutely convinced in retrospect that in some way, I had a certain amount of catching up to do, which then slowed down some other things.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="318">QUESTION:  Did you have trouble in -- in <span class="BUILDING">class</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  I think that I did not do -- well, I know I -- I -- I think -- I didn’t do very well in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , I was no scholarship student. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I don’t think I was the smartest kid in class, nor the dumbest kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I was an average kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">But somehow, when it came time to spend time on this or that, in terms of homework and other things, I spent less than I should have. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Not at -- all the time, and not all -- every year. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I had a marvelous <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">My three years in <span class="BUILDING">Central High School</span> -- and I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">Central High School</span> , were as important to me as any schooling, and that’s the only <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I have any feelings about, in terms of wanting to have any kind of connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I mean, I would consider going to next year’s 50" reunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I certainly would not consider going to the reunion of <span class="BUILDING">Temple University</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Penn State University</span> , or the <span class="BUILDING">University of Pennsylvania</span> , all of which I attended, and some of which even gave me a piece of sheepskin. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I have no particular connection with them, or with it’s -- or with classmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">So Central is very important, it was a formative -- as it should be, but also a transformative time for me, because of where I came from, where I had been, and what I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I remember only one kid that I can recall, who had an experience similar to mine, but I don’t know all the details of it, who also had been born overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Only one kid I can remember, 1n a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that because it was a city-wide <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was quite eclectic in it’s combination of whites, blacks, Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Not -- I can’t recall any Hispanic kids, because there just weren’t any in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philly</span> at the time, and not too many Oriental -- or Asian, or whatever you want to call, youngsters at the time, because there weren’t any. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">There were some, but not enormous numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">It was a white, middle class school.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="337">ANSWER:  Yes and no. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Yes, in that I think my father in fact, was able to achieve what he wanted, and my mother with him, a sense of community involvement, and the -- all the various social and other kinds of organizations and things that -- and I’m not going to enumerate what it takes to be a member of a community, but we were not housebound, and we were active in this, that, and the other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And they -- my parents became involved in a association of survivors there, and all kinds of Jewish kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">My father became very active in the cantor’s organizations, chairing the local group, eventually becoming the national president of the cantor’s assembly. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">This is after I left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but he was very active, and very involved, and if you talk to any cantor today who is over the age of 50 -- cause the younger ones don’t know him, but the -- would know Yehudah Mandel. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">He was very well known, and very well respected, and did fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">The community, the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was a major <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Not a major <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , but a significant <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">QUESTION:  How so?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">ANSWER:  Because it had been there for 50 years, and it had a tradition that people came back to it even after they moved away. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">It was not one of the most prestigious, or one of the wealthiest <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> , cause it was not in the wealthy part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Interestingly, it did not choose to rebuild in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">When it came time for the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> to essentially die, it was sold, and it’s holdings were transferred to another <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , so there was no second generation of that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">It was built in ’24, I think, 1924. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And in 1970-something, 50 years later, it just out -- ran out of it’s usefulness in that community, and it’s holdings were transferred to another <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> , actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="352"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> ’s a very large, physical, geographic place. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">But it ceased to exist as a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , but for the years my father was there, 35 years, it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">So that was very much so -- one of my limitations was that being from a observant family, there were many things I didn’t do. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I didn’t go to the <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> -- as little as people did, but I didn’t go to the <span class="BUILDING">hotdog stands</span> , and I didn’t do this, and I didn’t do that, and I wasn’t available Friday night, and Saturday morning I didn’t go to the ballgame. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">There were things that I did not do, because they did, and I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Eventually that changed to some degree, but there was always a little bit of an overtone, not a stigma --
QUESTION:  Did you chafe against that in any way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">ANSWER:  Chafe, no, resent to some small degree, or found some restriction, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">But then again, one of my f -- good friends lived across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , was six foot three at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">He chafed against being so tall, because that was unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">The center of the basketball team was six the -- three, and today six foot three 1s a midget. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">So the question is how one chafes against things. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">I wouldn’t say I chafed against it, I think that I recognize it, and most of my buddies recognize it as well, and say, “Well, where are you going to be Friday? </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Oh, I -- I know you, Friday you have to be in <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , right?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="365">That’s right.” </span><span class="sentence" id="366">You know, you’re singing in the choir, your father’s choir, I did that for awhile, those kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So people understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">My circle of acquaintances, and the circle of acquaintances of my friends were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , 99 percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I cannot remember being in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of a non-Jewish kid in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And it was not a religious -- you know, it was not an observant th-thing, nor was there any kind of an injunction against. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">It’s just they weren’t part of our friendship groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I didn’t have any black friends, lots of acquaintances, played on the teams with them, but I had no contact with them, they lived over there, and I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Wherever that was, the over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And the other differences were limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">I certainly had no <span class="BUILDING">church</span> connection, which is where a -- my non-Jewish friends gathered, and various organizational things, and I didn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">Catholicism class</span> , and I didn’t go to, you know, to mass.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">QUESTION:  Did you -- how did you identify yourself at that time? </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Did you think of yourself as an American right away, or did you -- did it take awhile for that to happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">ANSWER:  In some ways -- and again, I thought about this in terms of today’s conversation, in some ways I’m not sure I’ve ever consider myself labeled. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">There’s no question in my mind that everybody sees me, and I am in fact, and have been for the last 50 some years, an American, more so than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">But every once in awhile my good friend on the <span class="REGION">west coast</span> will call me that crazy Hungarian kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">So there are some glitches in that perfect -- I mean, they’Il call my wife something, too, but they call her crazy New Jersey kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">At least that’s in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">But there are some things that I’ve probably maintained -- retained, that I’m not even conscious of. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I never -- and I repeat because it’s important for me to repeat to myself, I never consciously tried to acculturate, or to assimilate in anything that I did, by speech, or by dress, or by manner, or by behavior. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">That just happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">But I think underneath it there was always an element, and still is, of the first 10 years of my life, and the first eight years in Europe, the first 13 years overseas, and the subsequent years here. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">You want to remember also, that developmentally, a kid changes more in the first 15 years of his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Once he gets to be kind of an adult, he tends to be the same for al -- as long as he lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">But the changes, the developmental tasks of infancy, childhood, and later of adolescence, and there are such things, kind of need to take place by the time you’re 18 - 19, or 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And from that point on, you either are or you aren’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And I hope I am.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">QUESTION:  When you were approaching the end of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , how did you think about your future?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">ANSWER:  Well, I was going to be an engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">No question. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">If you look at my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> yearbook, it says, career path, engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Only problem was I had an --
QUESTION:  What did that mean to you, engineer, what kind of engineer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">ANSWER:  Well, he tinkers. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">An engineer tinkers. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I had no idea that an engineer sits behind a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drafting board</span> for two, or three, or four, or five years, in an <span class="BUILDING">engineering firm</span> , going absolutely bonkers. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">When I began to become somewhat familiar with that, I said I don’t think I want to be an engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Aptitude-wise, apparently -- I mean, I don’t recall the particular scores, and cuda preference tests, and strong vocational tests and things of that nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Tests with which I’m familiar for other reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I think I scored okay on math, and physics, and other kinds of things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">But I really -- and I am sure that subconsciously again, by formative previous years, had something to do with, I thi -- I thought I wanted to go onto some kind of human services, not engineering services. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And I thought I wanted to, in some way work with people, and not with things, which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And I transferred into a liberal arts program.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">QUESTION:  In <span class="BUILDING">college</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, you started in an engineering program?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  Well, the first year of any <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , engineering or anything else, is the same thing, you take English 101, math 101, everything else 101, but in the first year. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Now, what I did, I wanted to be very much independent in a sense of paying for <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">ANSWER:  Now, one of the advantages I had, having come from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and the background that I had, I was a Hebrew school teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Full time, which [indecipherable] 10 hours a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Four to six four days a week, and 10 to 12 on Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">In that amount of 10 hours of work, I was able to make as much as some of my buddies who worked 20 or 30 hours in <span class="BUILDING">grocery stores</span> , and after school jobs, because the rate was higher. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I mean, I probably have earned as much as 900 dollars a year, but 900 dollars a year was two years worth of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , because my first year at <span class="BUILDING">Penn State</span> , was 410 dollars, 205 dollars a semester. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">So I’m saying I was able to do what I wanted, namely pay for it myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">My parents, though they were getting to be a little bit more comfortable as time went on -- this is 1955, my father had been here five years, his salary was acceptable, he was teaching in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , he did concerts, he did this, and appearances, and what. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And I think that they were, economically, certainly comfortable, and remember, they didn’t spend a great deal of money eating out, because <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> weren’t kosher, and it wasn’t the tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I mean, this is before the fast food avalanche, and everybody didn’t go out to fe -- Chinese food, you know, three times a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I’m not sure they do it today either, but still. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Anyhow, I was able to fund a certain amount of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I was able to then go to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that was as close to being away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as I could think of. </span><span class="sentence" id="424"><span class="BUILDING">Penn State University</span> had <span class="BUILDING">campuses</span> throughout the <span class="REGION">state</span> , including one in oga -- at the <span class="BUILDING">Ogontz campus</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jenkintown</span> , <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> , commuting distance from my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I had one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eerie</span> , and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dubois</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Several centers were you could go for two years, and then you have to transfer to the main <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> at <span class="BUILDING">state college</span> , or transfer to some other <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">So for two years I had this idyllic life, from whatever in the morning, until three o’clock in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">At four o’clock I had to go teach. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And I was out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> [indecipherable] that I would either drive up there, or my father would pick me up or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">It was arranged, and not a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">But I had this idyllic life on this tiny little <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> of maybe 300 kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">It had been the Ogontz School for Girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And miss --
ANSWER: O--O-g-o-n-t-z, Ogontz, Indian name. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">It’s a section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And Mrs. Sutherland, or Miss Sutherland, who had been the headmistress of the <span class="BUILDING">Ogontz school</span> , lived on the <span class="REGION">property</span> , in this little <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> -like <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and she had rights to live there for the rest of her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">When she died, I don’t know what happened to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="437">But this was- and we had a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">gazebo</span> , and a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> , and ducks. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">It was the most idyllic kind of life that you could think of, for a couple of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Then reality kicked in, I was not going to go up to the <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> , because I would have had to lose my teaching job. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">It was important to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I transferred to <span class="BUILDING">Temple University</span> when I finished the undergraduate work that I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And <span class="BUILDING">Temple University</span> in those days was 475 dollars a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">So again, I could afford that. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">But you ask about what I did in my first year. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">At <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ogontz</span> , at <span class="BUILDING">Penn State</span> , I transferred -- I can’t remember now whether it was in the first semester, or the second semester. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">As I made out programs for my second year, I moved into -- more into the humanities, and into sociology, psychology and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">But even in your second year, things are pretty well -- re-requirements, you don’t have -- and this is 1955, this is not 1995, or 2005, where, you know, kids go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and take one class a year, and then go back for basket weaving two. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I mean, there are many jo -- they do this the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and in el -- in -- literally in the mel -- <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , the choices of curricula. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Well, there were less choices, and in my second year, I don’t recall exactly, but I do remember that I moved away from the physical science, into the social science.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">QUESTION:  And living at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">ANSWER:  Living at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">QUESTION:  The whole time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">ANSWER:  Living at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the whole time. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Never a thought of living away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And I’ve often thought whether that was an issue of my choice, or I just couldn’t conceive -- I can tell you this much, that I certainly didn’t think of living away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as an expression of independence. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I was very independent at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I guess I had lived in enough different situations, that I didn’t have to prove the fact that I in fact could find my way on my own, by living away. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And I think economically it was not a good idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I mean, where was it going to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="459">There are some people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> who lived at <span class="BUILDING">Penn</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">University of Pennsylvania</span> , who are city residents, you know, who lived a half an hour from the -- as people here live at <span class="DLF">college park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">If I was in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> these days, I never would commute. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I’m sorry -- I would always commute, I would never be a resident student at <span class="DLF">college park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">My kids were resident students at the <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> , but they at least were outside of commuting distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">So my wife, interestingly, I mean just as a contrast, although this -- it’s no impact on me, I hardly knew her then, commuted to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , although she had a scholarship to attend any <span class="BUILDING">university</span> -- any <span class="BUILDING">state university</span> in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">She was [indecipherable] she had a Regent’s scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">She could have gone to <span class="REGION">New Brunswick</span> , from the <span class="REGION">Newark area</span> where she was raised, and been a resident student. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Because of a number of things, she chose to live at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">So interesting, we were both commuting students as undergraduates.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">During these years -- first couple years of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , and you’re still working every day, teaching?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="471">QUESTION:  You’re still thinking about what it is you’re going to do, you haven’t completely -- that idea hasn’t really formed in your mind?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">ANSWER:  I wish I could identify for you at what point I began to make more of a concerted direction decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Probably when I wo -- when I transferred -- when I finished two years at <span class="BUILDING">Penn State</span> , and as I said, I couldn’t stay there any longer, I had to either transfer to the main <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> at <span class="DLF">college park</span> , or transfer to any <span class="NPIP">place</span> else that would accept me, and I was [indecipherable] acceptable things. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I transferred to <span class="BUILDING">Temple University</span> , which is the commuting school in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And I’m trying to think of whether it was a particular teacher, or particular curriculum that got me involved in what was another Ford Foundation trial program. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I am currently, and have for the last 45 years been a professional social worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I’ve been in private practice now for 20 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I say that because that’s where I got to because of what I decided then. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">There was some kind of a program in the school of education department of secondary education, which combined majors in sociology, psychology, political science, history and economics. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">That attracted me, as a -- this kind of a [indecipherable] thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Now, at the end of that completion, you could practice teaching, become a teacher, which I did not do. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">My undergraduate degree is as a bachelor of science in education. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I was a qualified, but not certified teacher in <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Had I practiced ott, I would have become certified, I think, in history or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">So that attracted me, the choice was to do that, and the other choice was to go to school of social work in graduate programs. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And at the time there was really only one <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , that was the <span class="BUILDING">University of Pennsylvania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">As this is going on, and I think back to a couple of people at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , who were instrumental in talking with me about these things, and these are programs that some of the courses had practicums attached, in the field of social service, in the field of social welfare, in the field of social work. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I began to think more and more in relation to maybe doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I knew I'd have to go to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> , which didn’t bother me conceptually. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I was a little worried about the fact that the United States army might interfere. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And I was very concerned if my career in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> is interrupted, will I go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> afterwards, and there’s no way to guarantee that, I took the deferment exam, I did everything I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I wouldn’t say that I had a daughter for that purpose, but that didn’t hurt, because here I was 23 years old or something, or whatever, and with a wife and a family, and I had to sign a commitment up to the age of 35, but I wasn’t drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">There was a reason why I wasn’t

<p><span class="sentence" id="505">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">ANSWER:  The rules stated that you could become a citizen at 18 on your own if you had been here for five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">If you were here for five years before you were 18, you could become a citizen on your parent’s papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">But I was sworn in to this da -- the <span class="BUILDING">federal court</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> in December of 1954 -- ’54, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">QUESTION:  Was that a significant, memorable moment for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">ANSWER:  I gotta tell you that I have to think about it, because I haven’t thought about it daily. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Pll tell you two things about the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">One, I certainly felt more American that day, not because of the swearing in, but because who else was being sworn in. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I was, as I remember, the only recently graduated <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> kid being sworn, everybody else was older. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">There were two guys who were in Air Force uniforms, who had to renounce their titles in the Czech royalty. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">They couldn’t be Count PFC, they had to be Mr. PFC. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">There was arule, you cannot hold a title in the States, but they were already in the Air Force, or maybe the army -- I think in the Air Force. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I -- but there were other people were there, they were all older now, and older probably by three, four, five years, or 30 years, but not anybody my age, and I was an American kid for whom this was a right of passage, no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I didn’t have any difficulties with the three questions they asked me, which may have been what’s the highest <span class="BUILDING">court</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and what are the highest legislative bodies in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Remember, I was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philly</span> , not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">It was an easy th -- it was a non -- 1 -- 1t was anon -- how do -- it was not, as I remember it, an emotionally important kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I didn’t have my parents with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I didn’t go to their swearing in. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">It was a routine that you had to do, like renew your driver’s license. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">It was equally emotional, because I felt so very comfortable with where I was, and how I went, and who I was, and what I knew in terms of the American life. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">It wasn’t a sheltered existence in my own self-made ghetto, whatever <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that is, as many people do. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I'd been involved in the swearing in ceremonies here, because of a commission I served on at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And it’s interesting to see the people now, that’s a very different world, but still you see the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> that come. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">The Thai community comes to the swearing in of it’s Thai people, and the Cambodians to the Cambodians, and to the Salvadorians to the Salvadorians. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I didn’t feel that I was a member of any of those communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">QUESTION:  That’s interesting, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">ANSWER:  But I really -- I have to tell you P’ve not thought about -- I know it was December 1954, and I re-remember the -- the -- the <span class="BUILDING">U.S. court</span> , but I don’t remember anything about it that would have been remarkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Maybe the word is unremarkable, to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">But again, I was the only kid that I can remember, there was a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> -- just recently graduated <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> kid, I guess I was at <span class="BUILDING">Penn State</span> , I don’t reca -- call what day it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Obviously took the day, and I took care of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">But I didn’t make any kind of a thing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">As I said, my parents didn’t come with me, not because they had to take me, but because it wasn’t that -- important yes, significant, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">During these years, were your parents weighing in with thoughts about what you should do in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , or were those decisions left pretty much up to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Did you discuss those kinds of things with your parents very much?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">ANSWER:  I’m sure I did, and I’m sure that it was a non-significant discussion. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I know that my father said to me when I was at <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> , he says, “I don’t know what social workers do, but I have a feeling that 1t may not be the most lucrative thing for anybody to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So I have a recommendation. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Start on your second million. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Takes all the pressure off making the first.” </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I took up his advice, and I’ve done exactly what he told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">But I have no -- social services, human kind of work, that kind of stuff was understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">In those days the interest in working was for some agency type occupation, not the private practice that I do now, or the independent practice, where I see independent patients on my own <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And that was understood, because lots of folks, and lots of community positions had that kind of background. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And the difference was this job was different than that job, but that kind of training was similar. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And look, my father had been in communal kind of involvement for a long time, he was very active in the chaplaincy. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Bumped into social workers all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and all the veterans in all the regular <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="553">He was the chaplaincy’s chaplain. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">My mother was involved -- grew up in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that was community based. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Her father was the rabbi of the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">The one rabbi in the community of 3000 Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novisad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">So this was not something that was on <span class="NPIP">Mars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">But I have no recollection really. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I think my parents were very interested in my finishing <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I think they were very concerned that would I finish on what terms, because they 36 obviously were aware that my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> career was not brilliant. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">It was not the kind that <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were chasing me with scholarship offers. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I mean, I finished -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Emanuel Mandel. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">This is tape number two, side A. Your parents didn’t really pressure you in any specific direction as you were deciding what you would do, as you were in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Was there ever any thought that you would move in a -- in a more religious direction, that you would go become a rabbi, or a cantor? </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Was there -- did your father --
ANSWER:  That’s a terrific question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">QUESTION:  -- want you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">ANSWER:  They did not push me vocationally in any direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">They did push me educationally, because they thought it was important to attain a certain status of having earned a degree, that was important. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">As far as specifically, I think that they would have been -- my father particularly would have been happy if I had been more involved in some religious life avocationally, although I don’t think he would have necessarily recommended the rabbinate, and don’t misunderstand, and the listener shouldn’t misunderstand, that he had some feeling that that’s a lousy job for a nice Jewish kid, in some ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">It ha -- this -- th- the politics of the rabbinate is not -- no, the rabbinate 1s not without politics, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="571">The cantor has a different element. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">The cantor requires, at least by his judgment and mine, a certain talent which I did not possess. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">I was not blessed with a voice, as he and many others. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">He could learn everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">But the performance piece requires the talent, and I didn’t score well on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">I sang in his choir until my voice changed kind of, and -- and I’m still, at this point, very interested in the cantorate, and varying s -- music, and the only thing I play is the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">So, no I -- th-the question 1s good, and they would have been pleased, but I don’t think that he’d -- they really thought that if I am involved in some kind of communal service of a Jewish nature, that’s close, that’s close, and it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">QUESTION:  And that was the assumption, that it would be 1-in the Jewish community?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">ANSWER:  I think so, I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And it was, in fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I don’t know if that was because it was so directed, or because I saw no cha -- no choice anywhere else, it was not that I didn’t see choices anywhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">If I hadn’t been involved in a scholarship program, in Jewish communal service, given by the B’nai Brith, which funded my <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> , and then I owed them some time, I would have been very interested in going into a different element of human services. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">In fact, in the -- in -- as a social worker, yes, but in the rehabilitation. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">In that -- and I did an internship, or an externship at the wa -- <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , and I was very interested in being involved in the elements of helping people adjust to the dite -- activities of daily life, now without a hand, or now with a major disability. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Because the point is you don’t put them into -- onto -- put them on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">shelf</span> , and make them not participate. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Now, there’s got to be some acknowledgement for the fact that they may not be the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I mean, blind folks are not going to be pilots, rights or no rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">But, that doesn’t mean there’s nothing else they can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And that whole element of that kind of retraining, and re-understanding of the psychological dynamics of being disabled, fascinated me, included the physical elements of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And I would have gone into that element of things, as many others that I had thought about, if I hadn’t had a Jewish commitment. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And in fact, a guarantee that I have to take a job for two years, because I have to repay them for their having given me a scholarship to <span class="BUILDING">University of Pennsylvania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">So yes, the Jewish element was there, the Jewish vocation element specifically, in terms of rabbinate or cantor, it was not.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="597">ANSWER:  Well, not that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">What happened is that there is a World Federation of Hungarian Jury, I think is it’s name, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">My father knew some of the people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">My father knew lots of people, and lots of <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and he used those contacts for appropriate things. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And my father tells me again I’m digressing on him, but it’s interesting that he went to call on a person as a matter of courtesy, not because he was a supporter, but because of what he stood, what -- what he represented, who at that time lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , and was one of the major enemies of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">This was the Sotmire rabbe from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sotmire</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , Rabbi Oyle Titlebaum, who my father knew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sotmire</span> , which is in the general area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ruthinia</span> where my father was raised. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And he called on the rabbe, as an acknowledgement of the rabbe’s achievement in the ra -- in the rabbe business, as a scholar, not as a political entity. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">But he is the leader of the Sotmire Hassidim, and he’s not gone, but when he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , they changed the ne -- the notation on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> from the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to cover it up, because after all, since this was not created by the Messiah, it did not exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And Titlebaum would have given <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to Abdullah, and wait for the Messiah to come to create the state. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">So, clearly there was no agreement on the politics, but my father call on -- now why did he call on him? </span><span class="sentence" id="607">He knew him from there, and Titlebaum was with us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="608">He was one of the 1600. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So there are many people that you tend to know, but to get back to -- to the issue that’s closer to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> --
QUESTION:  Did you participate in those activities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">The World Federation hungar -- of Hungarian -- of -- Association of Hungarian [indecipherable] was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and knew some people from before. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">They, my father and some others, started an organization called the Hungarian Hebrew Association of Philadelphia. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">It was not necessarily of survivors, or a survivor organization, but by definition 98 percent of them were survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And they had the fundraisers, and they had programs, and they had concerts, and they sponsored Israel bonds, and they sponsored Jewish National Fund, they sponsored the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and other kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">So this was an element of not a survivor organization, but an organization of Hungarian Jews, who by definition were -- I don’t know about 98 percent, but substantially either survivors, or people with survivor families who may have come here before the war, so they were not survivors, quote unquote, but they were in fact part of the same community. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And he was very active in that, and I was involved in -- in my way, I mean the picking up and the dropping off of packages, the rummage sales. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I’m not sure I attended too many of the meetings, I certainly went to their programs. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">They would get together and they would cook potluck dinners, enormous ones for the community, and my mother was again involved in the cooking for large numbers, cause she knew something about how do you do whatever Hungarian cooking type things for 200, not for three. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And whatever they were, whether it was sour cabbage or some other things, and again this was usually done at the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , where my father had certain privileges. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">He could rent easily enough, and make arrangements for making it available, and he would pay arent, and they would have programs, and that was something they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">My involvement in that was limited, but clearly I was involved in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">QUESTION:  Your father then -- and y -- both of your parents, their professional and social lives were very much bound up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community,</span> as he --

<p><span class="sentence" id="624">ANSWER:  His, my mother had no professional life any more, she didn’t have any professional life since she -- really since the time she was married, although she had a little bit afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">She’d been an enent -- <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> teacher for kiddies in <span class="REGION">southern Hungary</span> , and she taught in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Temerin</span> , which 1s a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novisad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I don’t know if she taught for three, or four years, maybe five, I don’t recall the exact numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">They were married in 1930. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">My mother was 24 year -- 22 years old, so she couldn’t have taught -- well, she taught some years after that until left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novisad</span> -- maybe four years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">QUESTION:  And was there involvement more to sort of be part of that community, and maintain the ki -- the welfare of that community, or -- how political was it at that time?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="646">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">ANSWER:  The Israel issue is not a political one. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">That’s an emotional one. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">It is alway -- there’s a familial -- I mean, we send packages, we had communication, we had some visits. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">I mean, I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for the first time since I came in 1957, as did my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">We went separately, but we met there. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I then again went in -- in °57 -- in ’60, I went, I don’t know, half a dozen times, or a dozen times since. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">But the connection 1s -- was very clear, but it was not a political one. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">It was not a support of labor, or a support of hashomir atsyere, or a support later of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leecould</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="655">It was not a political involvement on their part. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">I would think -- since <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> had an open primary system, you could vote for any party you wished, I would suspect that they registered democrats. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I certainly was, and I think that had to do with who was, in fact, representing. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">I mean, this was the era when Truman had been an important guy, and then came Eisenhower, and then came Stevenson as a candidate, and then came Kennedy. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">In that milieu -- Kennedy’s the first president I voted for -- in that milieu, democratic party seemed like the thing I wanted to be involved with, because I couldn’t find any kind of connection with the republicans, though the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , the -- the -- the -- the governor of <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> was a republican, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> had a long, long -- a republican mayor, until 50 something or other.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="707">ANSWER:  None.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="709">ANSWER:  Her parents were born here, her grandparents -- her grandparents came from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , from Europe, three out of the four, but they came as young people, before the first World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">So survivors -- she had some aunts. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">But -- and she had a cousin, her mother’s cousin, Alex. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">But no, no real survivor connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">I may have been the first one that she really met. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Was a kid in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> she talks about who arrived at her, maybe <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> , who came from Europe, and everybody was nice to her, and they gave her special help, and taught her English and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">But limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">You also have to have some understanding of the nature of the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Hillside, <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> was kind of an enclave outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newark</span> , between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newark</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elizabeth</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="718">But no, I would say that her involvement with survivors, even though she may disagree to some degree, was at best limited.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">QUESTION:  And did that cause any difficulty between you? </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Was there any <span class="DLF">bridge</span> to <span class="DLF">gap</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Any <span class="DLF">gap</span> to <span class="DLF">bridge</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">ANSWER:  I don’t think the survivor thing has -- was the <span class="DLF">gap</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I think the difference in some upbringing, the religious difference -- she comes from a essentially <span class="BUILDING">sectarian home</span> , Jewish but sectarian, and I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I think that the differences in where we spent the first 12 - 15 years of our lives -- I mean, her notion of the war was that they had air raid alerts in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and they crawled under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">My notion of the same time was air raids. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">There’s a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">And that difference, I think, has -- had been there -- ha -- has been there, is there, and will be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And we’ve been together for a very long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I mean, we're -- 1958 is now what, 47 years ago?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">QUESTION:  There’s so many stories you hear about people who came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and me- meeting American Jews, who have no understanding of what they’ve been through, and how that sometimes caused friction and difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="731">ANSWER:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">QUESTION:  Was that a problem for you before you met your wife, and -- and -- or were there any kind of incidents that you remember along those lines, about, you know, American Jews not understanding what you’d been through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">ANSWER:  I don’t think so --
QUESTION:  Or you thinking that they should, or --
ANSWER:  I don’t think so at the time, because of the difference between myself and the adult community. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">I think my parents experienced that much more so than the kid community, who kind of went with the flow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">ANSWER:  I mean, my buddies knew this, that, and the other thing, and didn’t care about the rest, and didn’t -- I didn’t accuse them of not having been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and they didn’t hold me accountable for having been there. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Not among kids, and I’m talking about kids now up to the age of, you know, college age. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Adults, something else, their sense of establishment when they came, what they did, why they didn’t help, the whole issue about Roosevelt and various emissaries, and the interest that the national government had, and what they had to do, and [indecipherable] the first to recognize that the first interest had to be the protection of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="739">But that doesn’t mean they couldn’t have had something to do with other things as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">But there’s a whole issue involved with who they were, what they were, what thi -- their upbringing was. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">But I’m saying -- the question that you ask I think relates with my parent’s generation, not to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="743">ANSWER:  I can’t recall anything that will be significant that I can tell you, where this -- this rub, this -- this chafing, as you said earlier, was of issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="744">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Do you know of specific incidents about your parents experience along those <span class="DLF">lines</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="746">I mean, was there --
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">No, well, specific, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">I think that there were issues having to do with the fact that anybody who didn’t come here on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mayflower</span> , and nobody I knew came on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mayflower</span> , was seen as -- the reference being a greener, a newcomer. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And that came up once in awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Certainly my father had that because the kind of life that he had to start all over with for the third time, was not the kind of life that he had in th-the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And in some ways he resented that, and to some degree he expected things of people in terms of performance, in terms of responsibility, that he thought was appropriate to expect.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">QUESTION:  I don’t -- can you be more specific about what you mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="753">He expected what kinds of things from people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="754">ANSWER:  He expected -- well, you have to know something about him as well, which I’m not going to detail for you, but the point is he expected certain behavior norms, and cert -- if somebody said I’m going to do this, he should do it, not forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">This has nothing to do with being an immigrant, but it has to do with the fact that when he was in Europe, and was the chief cantor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , essentially if he barked, somebody said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And here he was not that, but the expectation may have been the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">If some of his colleagues said they will do this or that, or the other thing, and bring this piece of music to that rehearsal, he expected that. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And if they didn’t, it had something to do with him personally, but also with the fact that he did not -- he did not suffer fools well, cause he never had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">I think that he had some feelings about the fact that when he was looking for a position in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , he had occasions to go to various <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and to essentially go for tryouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And he was resentful of the fact, for example, that one rabbi said to him -- rabbi came from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> that he did in Europe, but came 20 years before, he said to him, “Well, you know, cantor, in this congregation, the cantor does the responsive readings in English.” </span><span class="sentence" id="761">To which my father said, you know, I mean, “Is that what you want me to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="762">I mean, you have now just said the weakest part of my armament is what you want me to feature. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">I mean, I can speak English, I can read English, but I have reasonably difficult accent, and this is not my -- I mean, I’Il do it in German, I’ll do it in Hebrew, I'll do it in Russian, but I won’t do it in English, because again, it’ll embarrass me, and itll embarrass you.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="764">Well, 1f you can’t do that, we can’t give you the job.” </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And he thought that there was an element of saying, uh-uh, I made it, you ain’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And that was a resent thing against the newcomer. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">It may have also been a resentment against my father’s skills and abilities, which may have been threatening to some others. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And he was an outstanding cantor, and if that sounds like a chauvinistic statement, it isn’t, alright? </span><span class="sentence" id="769">An enormous voice, was very well trained, and it scared the hell out of folks who weren’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Who were legends only in their own minds, and he was not, but [inaudible]. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">So there are things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">We came from <span class="REGION">central Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">The majority of the Jewish community in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> came from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="775">My mother was not Yiddish speaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">I don’t know if you know, but Yiddish was not spoken everywhere in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">My grandfather knew Yiddish very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">My father knew Yiddish very well, because when they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yeshiva</span> , which is the original schooling thing, you learned in Yiddish, you learned -- you learned Bible, which is written in Hebrew, discussing it in Yiddish, not in Hebrew, because you didn’t use the Hebrew language for secular conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">It’s a holy language, it’s only for study. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And you discussed it in Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">So they knew Yiddish, they spoke Yiddish at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Much of the community that you see here, that came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> had Yiddish in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="783">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> my mother was told any number -- she wasn’t told, it was told about her that she doesn’t even speak a proper language. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">How can the cantor’s wife not speak a proper language? </span><span class="sentence" id="785">What’s the proper language? </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">So those were things that they had to do with the fact that she didn’t speak a proper language, she didn’t come from the right <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and she didn’t come when we came. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">These kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Are they serious? </span><span class="sentence" id="790">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Are they significant? </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Somewhat. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">Impact? </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Some. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">Critical? </span><span class="sentence" id="796">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">That’s the valuation I can give you about the impact of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="798">QUESTION:  You finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you had this two year commitment, and what -- where did you go, what -- what kind of work did you do when you finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="799">ANSWER:  I had a choice to -- well, I had to take a position with the B’nai Brith youth organization as a professional member of the staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="801">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="802">ANSWER:  And I had a choice -- if not a choice, a 55 - 45 choice, so it was not a total choice, but a choice still, of taking a position in the <span class="BUILDING">Philadelphia office</span> , or taking a position in the <span class="BUILDING">Cleveland office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="803">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="804">I really thought that I wanted to have a career start not in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , for all the blessings of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , and all the negatives of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="805">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">While in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> , a position opened up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> , which is no more attractive than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> , but it was in a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> , with a different staff, with a different supervisor, with a different boss than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , and it would -- and it was the top job in the state of Michigan, and I was interested in that, to see if I could do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And I got that job, and as a consequence, I stayed well beyond my two year commitment, and I stayed with them for 15 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And I was with the agency totally for 15 years, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> and <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> -- well, even before, I was even in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> for a little time. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">But I stayed with the B’nai Brith organization as a professional social worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">They used to hire group workers in those days, which I was, and I ran a program for healthy, well-adjusted middle class Jewish kids in the state of Michigan.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="811">QUESTION:  What kind of program?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="812">ANSWER:  It’s a social, educational, religious, athletic program after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="813">They meet in groups called chapters, very much like I was involved as a kid in a chapter in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , my wife in a chapter in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And we would have gatherings, and -- where we met, and others met, and I had not the same, but similar programs, in <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> , and programs in the <span class="REGION">district</span> , which was the larger area of the <span class="REGION">Midwest</span> , and programs which were national, which was in the national encampment, which happens to be in <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="815">You know, it’s a home turf for me again, but that’s a -- it could have been in -- went to conventions the <span class="BUILDING">University of Illinois</span> , where we in fact, took the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Champagne</span> , for a convention of several hundred kids from that <span class="REGION">district</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="816">That was a large program divided throughout the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> into seven different <span class="REGION">districts</span> , and the details of that are not important. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">No longer that.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Deal with adolescents and adults in issues that are -- many of them are similar no matter what age you are in. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">Depression is depression at any age, almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">The separation issues for younger people are the same no matter where you are, many of them having to do with the need to strike some kind of understanding and insight that an outsider can strike, that the insider cannot. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">Example, family comes to see me with a kid who 1s a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> senior, and this is March of any year. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And the kid essentially has, in fact, run away, or left, come back after three or four days, because he feels that he no longer can function with the confines and the restrictions of the <span class="BUILDING">parental home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="856">It’s devastating for a family to have this happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">If you can help the parents make some adjustment, the kid make some adjustment, gain some insight, and postpone that runaway for four months. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Four months. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Now, the kid is going to go away to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="860">That’s a legitimate runaway. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">It’s a runaway in either case, if you nee -- know what I’m saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">But in the one is legitimate and not devastating to the family, and one is. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And sometimes the outsider can make that happen and observe that and understand it, cause I’m not emotionally involved with the kid nor the parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And the parents, what they’Il do is they’ II do every kind of tough love issue there 1s, and they’Il restrict, and restrict, and the kid will rebel, and rebel. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And the more you push, the more th -- you resist. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Well, if you can understand that, and the dynamics of that, you can be very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">And once in awhile I am.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="868">QUESTION:  It’s been a very interesting kind of gradual move for you in that direction, to working with people individually in their very intimate, kind of family problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">It’s not -- 1-1t’s not -- 1-it was an evolution for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="870">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="871">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="872">ANSWER:  I don’t think I could have said to you 35 years ago I’m gonna do that, because the number of folks in my <span class="DLF">field</span> who were doing that, you could count on one hand, and I’m exaggerating again. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">It was the province of the psychiatrist, who had limited medication to prescribe, because there weren’t any. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">I mean, anybody could prescribe medication, many psychiatrists could, and the medication of choice 50 years ago was various kinds of tranquilizers. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">If you tranquilize them enough, all mental patients will be docile, and they could be put in <span class="BUILDING">institutions</span> , and even into <span class="INT_SPACE">back wards</span> , which no longer exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">The world has become much more complex than it was as recently as 50 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">A hundred years ago I can’t talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">But in the last 50 years compli -- complexities have evolved geometrically. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">As a consequence, the kind of help that’s psychotherapeutically appropriate had to evolve into more practitioners. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Psychologists began to do some of that, those who became clinical psychologists, not research guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And today social workers provide more of that than any other profession by the number of hours provided in this community. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Now, I didn’t think of doing that because I on -- first of all, that was not part of my thinking, secondly, I didn’t think that I could -- this may have some to do with what I did as a kid, I didn’t think that I could take the risk of economically subjecting my family to a -- to a horserace while my kids were still in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="883">I didn’t start this until after they were out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="884">I figured the worst can happen, we’ll skip a meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">My wife and I will make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">And thirdly, I really thought that one cannot do this, no matter what training they have, until they have practiced in a variety of ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">I’ve always had individual attention to things. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">I mean, I remember when licensure became mandatory in the state of Maryland in 1970 - something or other. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And obviously I was well off that I was -- I was out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> 15 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And I had to put together the pieces of hours that I provided an individual psychotherapy, or individual counseling in the previous 15 years, an hour here, two hours there, three hours there, because I wasn’t doing this 40 hours a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">You had to come up with some 2,000 hours or something, and I don’t recall exactly how, but I think, you know, a percentage of every year was spent in this, in families. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I mean, I had to, in my job in <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> , I had to get a kid out of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> once in awhile, and I had to have a suicide attempt, and I had to have a runaway, and I had to have a something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I mean, again, these things add up, but I did this on a very limited basis, and then of course it became something I did full time. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">But I didn’t think I could it full time, until I had amassed the body of experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">So you talked before about gapping <span class="DLF">bridges</span> , or bridging gaps, I had to have <span class="DLF">bridges</span> to things. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And you don’t have a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> to various things until you’ve had some experience, not so much in life, but life and applied practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="897">QUESTION:  I’m leaping ahead to the big kind of question, but --
ANSWER:  You’re gonna bridge the <span class="DLF">gap</span> , or gap the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="898">QUESTION:  I’m always trying to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">What is it about your experience, your -- a fact of your being a survivor? </span><span class="sentence" id="900">What does that -- what -- what -- from that experience, what do you bring to what you do with people in -- in this setting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="901">ANSWER:  You'd be so -- you’d be so easy, and I -- and I have to tell you, I’ve thought about this a great deal, specifically because of this interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">It’d be so easy to say, well obviously I saw atrocities, I saw terrible things, I saw things that shouldn’t happen to humans, and the job that I now have helps humans, therefore -- that’s too glib, and too easy, and it’s not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">Now, does that impact? </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">But I think the impact is an on -- is on -- on the -- on the understanding of behavior, of motivation, of choices, of why do people sometimes go like sheep, and sometimes don’t go like sheep, and it’s the same people in different settings? </span><span class="sentence" id="906">I can’t tell you the answer to that, but those kinds of behaviors does in some way have some additional armament, or some additional <span class="DLF">bridge</span> to human behavior. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">But as I say, I cannot say, nor will I say to you that because, therefore -- it’s an obvious. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">I saw bad, I can do good, that’s a good thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">That’s glib.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="910">QUESTION:  But you were in a position as a child to perhaps focus on cause and effect of people’s behaviors because there was -- you were in some danger --

ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">QUESTION:  -- that I’m under some kind of danger here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">ANSWER:  Okay, no, I was -- I was probably in more danger specifically in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> when the independence war was going on, and shots were fired and some hit my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="915">It didn’t hit me, because I wasn’t stupid enough to be standing out there, but I’m saying that that kind of danger is a little different, but you’re right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="916">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="917">ANSWER:  I think that I have a capacity to observe, sharpened by 40 years of practice, by education, or by the eyesight that I was born with. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">I think I have an ability to in some way amalgamate various kinds of background pieces, and put it together into an approach, so that they become part of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">But I have to say again that maybe it’s because I was not old enough to understand, and maybe I would have understood at 15, the fact that I’m undamaged by it, at least substantially so, I recall, I understand, I can re-retell, I und -- I know what went on, and of course I understood the meaning of it subsequently, but I was not damaged the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">A siren doesn’t frighten me, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And a siren is an example that’s given by many survivors, they hear a siren today, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> , and they freeze on some level, to some degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">A siren does not frighten me. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">And again, a siren here 1s only a smallest of examples, because the sirens were very dangerous, because we were bombed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="924">We spent days in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , in -- not the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , 1n the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , and in the -- in the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="925">No, not days, we spent parts of days, sometimes four and five times a night. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">My grandmother, my father’s mother who was living with us at the time, went back to her little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , from which she was deported, because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> -- and I said this on the other tape -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> was invariably out of commission, cause they couldn’t get parts to repair them, and to go down five stories, three and four times a night, was too much for her to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Choice two was send her back where she didn’t have to go to the <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="928">And she was deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">Ah, she would have been deported perhaps, elsewhere as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">But I’m saying it’s because I under -- because I recalled, and can now, and have for some time been able to assimilate that. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">But I wasn’t -- you know, if you looked at my guts, they don’t have black and blue marks, they’re clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">Or my brain doesn’t have it.</span></p>

QUESTION:  My goodness.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="939">ANSWER:  -- for entirely different reasons, and I don’t think the Holocaust connected. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">One day they thought she had a stroke, cause she was dragging a leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">Literally days after the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 1967, they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to visit family, after the six day war. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And they came back in August, I know I picked them up, I was in the east, I was living in <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> , and my mother was not well. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">Well, this is in August, by December they discovered she had a massive growth in her head, and that killed her. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">I mean, they radiate it, but in those days this was a caveman oncology. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">I mean, this was the kind of thing that today two pills, and something would cure it. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And I don’t mean that literally, but --
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="947">ANSWER:  -- it’s -- we have gone thousands of miles beyond that. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">She -- this killed her. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">There was a choice of operating or radiating. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And we were told that operating would invariably- invariably produce a vegetable. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">My father and I agreed that that’s of no value if she lives to be a hundred, in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> as a vegetable. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">We radiated, 1t metastasized, she died, 1967. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">So the impact of my parents was significant, and in my father’s case lengthy, but very different in my mother’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">You remember that I was with my mother all of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">I mean, I left both of them 1958 - ’59. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">As a matter of fact, interestingly, we even lived with my parents for a very short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">When I was looking for <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> , one was in <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> , one was in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , one was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="958">And I couldn’t find a rental for my wife and I for three months, or maybe four months, for a very short time, I -- in those days, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> did not offer very short rentals, and I guess a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> was not an idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">So we moved to my <span class="BUILDING">parent’s house</span> until the decision was made where I would goi - go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And when it was made that I’m going to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philly</span> , we took an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> immediately, which was our first <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , which was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">But we lived with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">But it was with my mother throughout. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">When I was born, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> , two months after I was, my father went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> to begin his rehearsals for the holidays in the fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">My mother then packed up, and two uncles came out and helped her, and we trucked to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="965">My father was away from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for continuous times in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="966">We were at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="967">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , he was not with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">He comes after us to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , he leaves before us. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">So my father’s relationship with me as a child up to the age of 15 or so, is very spotty, and I am sure it had impact. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">I can’t tell you precisely, but he wasn’t there, through no -- and I never held him accountable for not being there. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">The fact that he was in his own <span class="DLF">field</span> , meant that he never played baseball with me, but you can overcome that. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">But he was not there, through no fault of his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">His influence was there, his impact was there, his feelings were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I’m going to back up for a teeny story about language. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">You asked about English. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">My mother and my father correspond when he is here, and my mother and J are still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> , and there were some times during the War of Independence in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> where food was scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">Plentiful, but some things were scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">We had all the dairy and all the veg -- butter was rationed, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="980">You could live without that. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">But all the bread, and all the vegetables, and some meat, and all the fish from <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> was available. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">But my mother says that things are scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">My father gets absolutely frightened, and goes to the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> , and I remember to this day, he packs up a package from the <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> , and ships it by <span class="DLF">air</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , 44 dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">It was probably a week’s salary in those days, 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Ships this thing to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="986">And we open up, and we see these little cans, little flat cans, and it says on it, Chicken of the Sea. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">Well me, with my incredible knowledge of English, decided this is chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">It’s a very funny, oily chicken that these Americans put in cans. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">Cans were not unusual to us, but what kind of chicken is this, and how do you cook it? </span><span class="sentence" id="990">I cannot tell you what my mother did with this, I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">But this was my knowledge of English, Chicken of the Sea was chicken, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="992">Well, we both know that’s not exactly what it means. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">My mother’s English was even less than mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">She didn’t even know the word chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">But we had this neat meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">As you know, kosher requires no mixing of the two. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">We had this very strange American chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">It didn’t taste like chicken, it was in oil. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">But it said chicken, and Mandel the English expert said --
QUESTION:  Mom --
ANSWER:  Mom, it’s chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">Cause he knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">And they also had corn flakes that were introduced, and we didn’t know how the hell do you butter corn flakes, like bread or that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">But again, I -- I couldn’t read the English, I mean I could underst -- I didn’t- I might have known the word corn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">I am certain I didn’t know the word flakes.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1009">ANSWER:  I mean, why would I? </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">And if I did, it was a filet of tuna, or a stew of tuna, or something that my mother could recognize as a fish.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1014">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1015">ANSWER:  But I was with my mother -- I sometimes illustrate it by saying that I always spoke with my father in the language of the <span class="REGION">land</span> in which we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">Hungarian in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , Hebrew in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , English here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">With my mother, Hungarian always. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">Not because she didn’t know any English, but with my mother it was always Hungarian, no matter where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">There’s a different continuity with her than was with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">So I missed his involvement, which was spotty, and clearly through no effort on his part to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">I suppose in some ways he could have been more of a dad only, but only in terms of throwing a ball right handed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">That’s silliness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">Every other <span class="NPIP">way</span> he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">And I had the most consistent part of his life with me when I no longer needed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">When I wanted it, but didn’t need it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">I mean, I was an adult, with two children, living in <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">That’s -- it was in those days that I had full availability of my father, and none of my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">So that my parent’s influence on me had these kinds of impacts, both good and both -- I have both bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">They both survived, but I did not spend equal time and equal impact for both of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1030">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">Did you and your mother talk about the day -- about the war, and your experience together in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> very much?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1032">ANSWER:  Not much, because we lived it together.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1086">ANSWER:  I wouldn’t want to -- I wouldn’t want to weight levels of trauma. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">However, from day one, whatever that is, I was willing to, I thought that it’s important to know, you can’t know where you’re going if you don’t know where you came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">Maybe a cliché. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">George Santayana’s comment about the fact that 1f you don’t learn history well, you learn to -- you have to repeat it or relive it is another one, there are many of those. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">And I have involved my kids in either visiting with me, speaking with me, going to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> with me, coming to programs with me, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, any which way I can, and I think they are quite conversant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">I did not believe that since it’s traumatic for me, I should not give them the opportunity to learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">That’s unfair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">It’s denying them experience that they should -- they can reject it, they can ignore it, but they have the right to possess it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">It is exactly what I said in the beginning of this conversation about archiving this material. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">I think that many of the people that are recorded -- I mean, that have been, thousands and thousands, may not be interesting, and may be repetitions of some other folks, but if it isn’t archived, it can never be retrieved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">And I wanted to archive it in my kids, and my grandkids.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1113">ANSWER:  I -- well it’s -- Xeroxing it is illegal, but it’s out of print. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">And I gave a copy to my -- each of my kids, and I have one in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">Couple of years ago -- last year I remember, my daughter gets me a present for my birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">She got it on the internet, she found two copies of the book, bought them both, one for her, one for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">I now have the book on the shelf, right next to Robert Saint Johns slightly fictionalized version. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">My point being that she thinks about these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">She had this idea, maybe on the internet with whatever, Amazon, oh I don’t know where, she was able to find the book, and there were three, I think, that were available, she didn’t need three, she got two. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">My son calls me up the other day and talks about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">La Spaitsia</span> , cause he saw some pictures with surfing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">Now these are all Holocaust connected, history connected to our family, that we were quite free to share, and to -- and to talk about, and to inform, and to update constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">When 1 did the Spielberg interview, my kids were here.

<p><span class="sentence" id="1125">ANSWER:  All I was saying 1s that these are normal activities of daily life that happen without any specific reason, it just happens, and we do it, and my kids are very much involved with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">My grandchildren, well, my son’s daughter is five, let’s wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">My daughter’s daughter is 10, and she knows a little bit, and the son is 14, and he knows a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">And again, there are these conversations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">One of the things I did for my grandson, the 14 year old, as part of my -- interestingly for a Bar Mitzvah gift, or right of passage, I took him to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">I thought at 13, or 14, he was old enough to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">And he -- I’m not going to say that he enjoyed it, but you know, he at least was exposed to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">Clearly, my taking him is an indication of my willingness, and his willingness to have the two of us have that experience together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">I was saying before on the tape that when the Spielberg interview took place in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , they asked the family be there at the end and they photographed the whole family, and my kids all came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And it’s quite an open door issue in this family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">It is not in many others, for many reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">I don’t happen to believe that protecting my kids of the reality of my past is a good thing to do, so I don’t.</span></p>
