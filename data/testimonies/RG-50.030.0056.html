<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Could you tell us your full name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Yes, my name is Eva Cooper. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My maiden name was Eva Brust and I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  And when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  I was born in 1934.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  And could you tell us a little bit about your life before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  My life before the war was very, very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I remember living in a very nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , actually an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">You probably know the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> is divided by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> and the part that I lived in we had mostly <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> as opposed to the other <span class="NPIP">part</span> which was private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And I was...uh...besides my parents, obviously, I had...uh...nannies and governesses and we led a very, very comfortable life with lots of vacations and...uh.. parties and I went to <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And... uh...in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we had...uh...we had religious education in the public school system...uh...besides the languages, arts, geography, history and math, everybody went to their own religious classes during that particular period so as Jewish children went to a <span class="BUILDING">class</span> where a Rabbi taught Jewish history, Hebrew, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Catholics went to <span class="BUILDING">Catholic class</span> and Protestants went to <span class="BUILDING">Protestant class</span> and everybody mingled and got along very well and I was never aware of Jewish or not Jewish or anything else pertaining to religion until much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And until 1944, which was when I was 10 years old, I really don't recall anything particularly disrupting my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">In retrospect, now I understand that many things were going on since 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I was aware that my father was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , but I thought that was just being a soldier and he always came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Uh...He went several times and came back and I...my mother did go help my father...run my father's business. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My father was in paper...wholesale paper manufacturing business. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Uh...But otherwise I, personally, was not aware of having to be afraid or being concerned until 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And that was a particularly special day in my life because my birthday is March 18th and I was having my 10th birthday party in my...my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with all my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">They were really my parents' friends, children who I was brought up with, as well as some of the mothers and a lot of the nannies or governesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And it was an early evening party of hot dogs, and...uh...we lived on a fairly main <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">We heard marching of soldiers and we looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and the German army at that point, to my recall, was occupying <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22"><span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was the last of the <span class="REGION">Eastern European countries</span> to be occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="23"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> had already had German troops in them. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And everybody started running around and there went my party. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Everybody went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And the reason being that they were all afraid and that the Germans at that time were occupying <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and...uh...that's when our whole world really fell apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Uh... There were a lot of negotiations. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I didn't really know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Everybody tried to keep the children from worrying and...uh...we lived in...uh...a designated <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that was called the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> ...uh... which happened to have been the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which we were in. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">What that meant is that several <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> , were designated <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span> where the Christians had the option to stay or go. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">In a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> , the Jews stayed and the ones that were not the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span> , the Jews had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Also we had a fairly large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and we were only allowed to live in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">But because my father was fairly active in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , we were able to pick the families to move into all the other <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So we had friends and family move in. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Uh...My parents' <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> because our...our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We had friends in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and somebody else in the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> and somebody else in my...in my old <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Uh...That's when I first was aware of the fact that things were not quite the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Also, one of the laws that came to pass at the time was that Jews could not have help, servants or whatever you want to call them. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And...uh...so all our so-called staff, which consisted of my governess and a cook and a maid, had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Uh...
QUESTION:  What were the sanitary facilities like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  Uh...Well, 1t was difficult because we had <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> and all that but it was a...1t was really really interesting from a child's point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">It was a time of sharing and pulling together. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I was an only child, so I thought it was just terrific to have all these children running around and I was always brought up very properly, to behave myself and speak when I was spoken to, and here they were all these people running around. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And one of my father's very good friends who was a lawyer and had a great deal of...a tremendous sense of humor wrote poetry for the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , to the effect that the men were to put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet seats</span> down after use and all sorts of funny things. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We just thought that this was great fun and we played jokes...uh...on the grownups and...uh...but things did progressively get worse because... And one of my first personal experiences as a child was when a little girl who lived in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , who stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ...all the Gentiles chose to stay in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in their own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> , but they kept the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And one little girl said...I asked if I could play with her in that afternoon as we usually had, and she said no, she couldn't play with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I said, "Well, how about tomorrow?" </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And she said, "No, she can't play with me tomorrow either.” </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And I said, "Well, why not?" </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And she said, "Because you're Jewish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And I said, "Well, I don't really understand what that means or what does that have to do with anything anyhow.” </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And she said well, she didn't know either, but her parents said that she couldn't play with a Jewish child.” </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So...
QUESTION:  What was a typical day like for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  Well, by this time we weren't going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We were only ...Jews were only allowed to shop and market in the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> late in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">They were only allowed on the <span class="DLF">street</span> ...uh...for an hour or so, when the produce and most of the stuff was gone and what was there was not terrific. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Uh...my father would go to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Community Center</span> to see what he could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Uh...My father was a prominent person in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> so that the wealthy Jews still had some influence and were able to do such things, such as acquiring the...the Star for our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> to remain in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and...uh...to get much more information than we would have gotten otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  Tell us about the Star.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  There was a Star outside the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that designated being a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish building</span> so anybody that would pass by that was not <span class="BUILDING">Jewish building</span> would know that this was a Jewish Star...<span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> and...uh...the Jews had to wear yellow Stars. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Had to be exactly put on each item of clothes as a certain measurement that had to be...and it had to be put on the left upper shoulder of each garment. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">In other words, that when you went out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , you should always be identified and if somebody wanted to spit on you, kick you, shoot you, take you away, that's what you were to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  Did you go out on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  Yes, I did go out on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">We did go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I have this...my...my little boyfriend who is 11, and he and I would go out and do some stuff in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">We would also buy newspapers and sell them within the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And...uh...we also, I remember...nobody in my family smoked, but people did. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Europeans smoked a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And we would pick up cigarette butts from everybody...wherever we could find them, take out the leftover tobacco and roll them in tissue paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I have no idea where we got the tissue paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And sell them to the smokers, because there was a shortage of all things. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And so having this and, of course, the fact that we were children everybody bought it for us and we decided that we would support our parents because we did realize that nobody was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And I'm not sure we supported them, but it was again great fun.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  Did you have any frightening instances on the <span class="DLF">street</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  No, I never had any frightening instances on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Uh...I did have...uh...a lot of fun things in the... in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> as a I said because we were friends and we had all the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We played tricks on people and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">But, 1t was getting to be frightening because you ...you had sense of doom. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">You had a sense that there was... there was a lot of whispering going on, and sometimes not knowing what is going on is almost as bad as sharing and being told that okay, these are the things that can happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Uh...There were a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> ...uh...obviously, going on the <span class="DLF">street</span> with lots of people in it, and everybody was making up stories about where they were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Labor camp, to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , all sorts of things, but it was...1t was getting obvious even at my age that people were being picked up, but I didn't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And this lasted from about the middle of March until...uh...the fall in October. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And in October, the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span> did no longer protect the people that were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Uh...my parents were able to...uh...get the Wallenberg protection papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Raoul Wallenberg, under the Swedish king, was able to protect and save a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">They were designated <span class="BUILDING">Swedish houses</span> , protectorates, where they claimed that Jews could be saved and we did go to such a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...uh...for one night and they had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I don't know how many. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But my parents decided that there were just two many Jews under one <span class="DLF">roof</span> and if the...1f the Germans really wanted to get rid of a whole bunch at a time, we would be better off going somewhere else where...where it would not be so obvious that we're together. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I think that night that we left our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in October was the first time that I was really scared and I think that was the experience that, as a young adult, stayed with me for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I was very attached to a pillow that I carried. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We had no suitcases to take with us because we had to travel light. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Uh...we were dressed, all of us, in several layers of clothes so as to have some warmth and have some change and I did take my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And...uh...I also had long...long hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I had long braids which were cut in case the sanitary facilities were non existent and I shouldn't get lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And I remember asking my parents...uh...where're we going to sleep that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And my parents said, "We didn't know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="99">We were just hoping that somebody would take us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I said, "But we have to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We have to sleep.” </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And that was really very upsetting and as I said that took me a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I always like to know where I'm going to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I don't like to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I have to know where my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> is going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And we went to somebody's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> who took us in for one night, that night, and again everybody whispered and it was really scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">People were being picked up on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And from then on, we went to several <span class="NPIP">places</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  Did you actually see people being picked up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  And what were your thoughts as a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  That I didn't know where they were going, and I didn't really get a lot of answers. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I mean I was asking questions, but I guess my parents were...this was not the time for the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">It was just time for me to be quiet and do what I was told. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I remember very distinctly once taking issue with something that I had seen, and my mother gave me a very stern lecture and she said that if she says it's black and if I know that it is white, but if she said that it is black, it is black and I am never, ever to question because that's how people get killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And this was not a time that people came up and said, "Are you Jewish," and my parents obviously were going to say no, and if I would have answered, "Oh, yes, we are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Why are you telling a lie?" </span><span class="sentence" id="118">That could get you into a lot of trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So I was really at a very young age told...was told to just do what I'm told and not to ask questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  Were you still wearing your star?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">At this time we were so serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">This was not admitting to being a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">This was hiding...uh...and my mother did not look Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">My father did. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And, of course, it's very easy to determine if a man is Jewish or isn't, especially in those days so that my mother always did all the talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And...uh...she was very competent and very strong willed and...uh...was able to handle these situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We did go to somebody's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we stayed for two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Uh...A man worked for my father and my father gave him the position as superintendent of one of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> , that my father owned, and he let us stay in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> ...uh...for a couple of days, and brought us food whenever he could. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And a very nice family who I think was aware that something that was going on, told the superintendent...uh...that they were going to be away for quite awhile and sort of insinuating that without their knowledge but it's okay, 1f we stayed in their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Uh...I don't think we ever met them, but that's what the superintendent told us, that it's okay for us to be taken to this <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">He would bring us a tray. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">There was a radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Uh...We listened to...uh...Radio Free Europe, and this lady happened to have had the best collection of child...of children's books, and I remember reading Little Lord Fauntleroy and a lot of the children's classics. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I remember that very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I was a avid reader, and that was the only place during the war that there were books that I read. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I used to remember taking a bath. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I was too hot and I almost passed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And one of the things that happened that I recall very clearly...and it's interesting because my mother just finished her interview and she didn't mention it...my father was having a kidney stone attack or had...we thought he had a kidney stone, and he was having an attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And he had no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">He had to go to a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So he went and he left...uh...quite late in the afternoon so as...so as to be dark and my mother and I sat there wondering if he would ever return, if he was going to be caught or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">But he had to go because he had I guess ...I'm not sure but he must have had a kidney problem before because the choice was not to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">It was not going to go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Anyhow, he returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I don't know what happened to the kidney or the stone, but he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And from then on, we went to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , a very beautiful <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And by this time, there was a lot of bombing going on because the Russians and Americans were bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">The Germans were starting to lose the war, so their interest in the Jews were getting less except if they happened to see any, they shot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">But I mean, it was not as active involvement in killing the Jews as to save their necks because they were losing the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I remember somebody being shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I think it was a Russian or a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">But I know there was a dead body, and somebody went out and stole their shoes or whatever they could off the body. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">But I don't really remember the details. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I just know that this was a body and people went and stole things off the body because peple were now at this point didn't have shoes, didn't have clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">The food situation was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And I was an obnoxious, terrible eater. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I still am. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I don't eat if I don't like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And most of the children just ate whatever there was to eat, including horsemeat off dead horses, but I was not having anything to do with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So I had a hard time being fed because sometimes when something was found that was edible I save it up for a week and chop up little pieces of it and I would just eat it because I wouldn't eat if I didn't like it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  What was your contact with other children then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">At one point, we were being hidden and there was another child there. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And that's when I was told that I was not to say that we were in hiding, that we were friends of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And I really don't remember too much about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  What were the living conditions at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  Terrible.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="251">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">At one <span class="NPIP">point</span> , I was supposed to be sent to a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And also some arrangements were made. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">A lot of Jewish children were being sent to convents because the nuns were going to take care of them and save them. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And then...I don't think I wanted to go and my parents just decided that we would all get through the whole thing together or...or not at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">QUESTION:  Any question of conversion for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Actually, before all this, we were told that...that...1f you had non-Jewish papers, Catholic papers...by a certain date that you would be...considered a half-Jew and possibly not be taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">So we did acquire Catholic papers and my father didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">My mother and I went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and we learned whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I don't...Cath...whatever you call it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">QUESTION:  Catechism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  Catechism and the beads and all that kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And we actually had to take a test or at least I remember taking one, and I remember reciting the...uh...what everyone recites, and so we had papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I don't know of my mother still has them, but we had papers saying that we were converted. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">My father wouldn't do it, but he thought it would be a good protection for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Subsequently it didn't help anybody anyhow because it was just another gimmick, but we did have the papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">QUESTION:  What was the attitude of priests and nuns during your classes and learning?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">ANSWER:  Fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">They were happy to convert, and I guess they were hoping maybe ultimately that people would remain. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And a lot did. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">A lot of people who came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> when we came...families of my parents I knew had converted when they came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , raised their children as non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Well, we always remained Jewish and after the war was over the paper that was just a piece paper that may have saved our lives at the time, but it probably wouldn't have. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So it sort of served its purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  When you were out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , were you aware of what was happening 1n other parts of Europe and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Do your parents talk to you about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">By that time we were aware of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I don't know if I personally knew what that meant and I think the grownups had difficulty acknowledging that there could be such a thing as...as...as <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> where they...where they gassed people. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I mean, to comprehend that whole thing 1s...1s very, very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And a lot of people who should have at the time believed that it existed refused to believe it because it was so mind-boggling and I don't reallythink I had any particular feelings or total awareness of just exactly...I knew we were in hiding and I knew we were running away from being taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And then as we started coming back, I remember my father saying that if there was anybody in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> he would just kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Which is most unlikely because he was a very, very gentle man. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">But you do get angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">But I think it was when it was all over for us, I think it was a relief that it was over and some of the anger kind of went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And I am an only child and since my parents and I survived together, that was already a good beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">A tremendous amount of our relatives were gassed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Most of these relatives being my grandmother's sisters, brothers, and their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Then after the war were the horrors of identifying people. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Yes.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="296">QUESTION:  So you went back to your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">What were your feelings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">ANSWER:  I went back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Glad to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">QUESTION:  What did you do when you got back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">ANSWER:  The <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was a mess. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Interestingly enough, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and all, that was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">It was not totally destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Windows were gone from bombings. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">This had nothing to do with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">This was, you know, the shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And...life just short of started all over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">People found whoever they found. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">People cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">They cleaned up...the cleanup process was really the bodies and they were just all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">At our <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> ...in the backyard of the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> -- the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> I guess is what you would call it -- became a <span class="DLF">graveyard</span> for those who could not be identified or they were such...they were so totally disfigured that they were not recognized. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">My father went to identify people and, you know, one of the ways to identify these bodies that were practically not recognizable through their teeth, through dental something. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I'm not sure what, but it was like their teeth or through birthmarks, stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So that was a horrible experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">QUESTION:  This is something you witnessed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And...uh...
QUESTION:  And your thoughts when you would see sights like this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  Scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And...but I guess it's interesting, you know, from a child's point of view, because I...I was with my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I always felt a certain amount of security and that I really think 1s what helped me come out of it fairly well-adjusted, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">For a long time as an adult 1n this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> or as a young adult, I never wanted to go anywhere without knowing where I'm going to sleep and I do not like sirens because we always ran to the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> and I always knew that when the bombing started that there was the potential of being killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">QUESTION:  What kind of <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> did you go to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="324">ANSWER:  Well, when we were still living in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , there was...the <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> , became <span class="BUILDING">bomb shelters</span> ad they were not set up with first aid. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">There were underground facilities under the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and whenever the bombings and sirens went off, everybody ran to the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">QUESTION:  What did you take with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">ANSWER:  Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Just whatever we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Some food, if there was any to be had. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">A flashlight, that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">As a child, you were just sort of dragged along to go and be quiet, and that was a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be and when the...uh...when it was over, then you came back up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And at this point it was obvious that many <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were bombed out and sometimes people died. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">So, you know, toward the end of the war, you didn't know if you were going to survive because...or not survvie because you were a Jew or just because you could get killed from the bombs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  Did you ever talk about not surviving with your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And so by 1945 we were back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">My father tried to get his business back and for a while it looked like everything was going to go back to normal, but then the Russians sort of started taking over what the Germans had taken over before. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And my grandparents had come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in 1939 to visit the World's Fair and my grandfather I guess he was smarter than most of us, had planned to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">He just didn't tell my grandmother because she wouldn't have left. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And so we came out here to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">It took a while to get papers and visas and all that kind of stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  When you first came back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , did you try to look up friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">ANSWER:  Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">QUESTION:  Some survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">ANSWER:  Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">QUESTION:  What did you talk about with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  Most of my friends were children of my parents' friends and they all survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And I think we were just really talking about all the things that happened and busy listening or not listening to each other's stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">A lot of these youngsters...well, they're not youngsters any more, they're my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">A lot of them are in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Somehave stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I have not stayed in touch with any of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">QUESTION:  What are some of your feelings about leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> to come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  I didn't want to leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">QUESTION:  Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  Well, that was my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">I mean, after...after the war was over, there were my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">There was my family, whatever there was, and it was an adventure coming here and we came through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and then we went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and we sailed on the Mauretania, which doesn't exist any more, but 1t was a <span class="DLF">Cunard Line</span> and we travelled first class. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">It was a wonderful trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And then when we came here, it was a very, very new life for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">But a child adjusts very quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">QUESTION:  Did your father have any experience with Adolph Eichmann?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">My father, because he was an important person in the Jewish community, met anybody and everybody that came to do any kind of negotiating and basically Eichmann wanted money from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and the wealthy Hungarian Jewish Community had a great deal of money and he made all sorts of deals to promise to release some people or take less people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camps</span> for money. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">So it was a trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And my father was in on some of the negotiations. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">They were not intimate friends, but as my mother told the story, that he was a perfect gentleman and elegantly dressed, as all Germans were, as opposed to the Russians, who were boors and did not, you know, their uniforms were not as the Germans' were. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">The Germans always were saluted and were, you know, in their own horrible way were always perfectly behaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Such as Eichmann who obviously was not a perfect gentleman otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And the Russians were...were just the opposite. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">But when the war was over, there were a lot of American soldiers were and my parents became quite friendly with some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And the, as I said, the wheels started working...to my father, was not really thrilled about coming to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I mean, he thought that everything was just...that was his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and...

<p><span class="sentence" id="376">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">No...after the war was over, for your own personal safety, there was no...there was no more problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Very slowly it was really the government, because of the Russians, the Americans left and and the Russians stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">But that took a while.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="393">ANSWER:  Well, that part was really...again, it was a very nice trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">It was a pleasure trip coming out. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I mean, we weren't running away with...with clothes on our backs. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">By this time, my father had acquired some of his properties back. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">We weren't penniless. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">We weren't escaping. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">We packed our belongings and we were taking a trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">We had left options that if my parents didn't like it here to come back, to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Things were packed, ready to be shipped if we had said to ship it or not.</span><span class="sentence" id="402">And as I said, wecame out first class and my grandfather was here. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">My uncle was here. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">We had relatives here. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">It was a difficult adjustment for my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">New language. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">New <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Different lifestyle. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">My father was a very prominent person in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and here he wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">So it took a long time for him to adjust...and probably a little bit faster for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">But I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I literally got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and then went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And except for the fact that I spoke with an accent and I was probably a little embarrassed that my parents did, I just became an American teenager.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">QUESTION:  Where did you settle?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> all my young and old adult life. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I went to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> and I have one daughter and three grandsons. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And that's the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I think that I got involved with the Holocaust Musuem...actually, my daughter had pointed out to me about a year ago a New York magazine had written an article about the Hidden Children Conference that had taken place last year in the summer, and she thought it would be something...something I should look into. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And I did attend the Conference and I realize that with my generation...it's kind of the end of the <span class="DLF">road</span> for the people that have been there, that participated. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">That after me it's just history, which is very different from having been there. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And I think that's for us who...whatever way participated in the war, it's very important to record the history, to tell our children and their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And when I attended the Conference, I went with mixed feelings, thinking, you know, the war is over. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">This was fifty or forty years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">What am I doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And I found the Conference very, very moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I found a lot fo Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Some from similar and some from different backgrounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">A lot of the nationalities formed support groups within themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">The Hungarian women of my generation formed a group. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">The Hungarian women that have been meeting monthly and during the Conference besides meetings and people still searching for each other and people finding each other...there was also a large library of books on the Holcaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And I bought one book: the name of it was Remember Never to Forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And it was a book written for children in a very simplistic way with pictures, black and white barbed wire, but nothing particularly scary, certainly if you don't know what it's all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And I bought the book thinking that one of the days when my grandchildren are old enough, I will read it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And I forgot all about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And this summer I took my oldest grandson who js six and a half to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to pick up somebody and as we were standing at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , he raised his right hand in sort of a Hitler salute and said, "Heil Hitler." </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And I was very upset and I tried very hard not to scare him. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">He didn't think he was doing anything bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And we sat down on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> and I said, "Adam, I don't ever want you to say that again, and I want to tell you a little bit about who Hitler was, what he did, and how it affected me." </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And he really was fascinated. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">He's a very bright little boy and he's very curious. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And I said, "When we go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I have a book that I'm going to read to you," which I subsequently did. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">But the reason he did this "Heil Hitler", because we had been watching "The Sound of Music", and he loved the music and that was one of the salutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">So that's where it all came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">But the concept was still there and I had to get rid of his other brothers, because they really were too young, and he and I went into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and read this story. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And since then he has very often asked me to tell him stories.</span></p>
