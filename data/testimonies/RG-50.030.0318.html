<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  I'd like you to start off by telling me your name, date of birth, place of birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Harold Zissman, although it is not my birth name. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My birth name was Zuckerman, same Harold. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called Austrofmazotyetski (ph) and that was about a hundred kilometers east from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My parents and grandparents and many generations before them were of the Hasidic belief. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">However, they were involved in business from crockery, porcelain, glassware, and they used to distribute it to the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> in the vicinity and in further away places, maybe 200 kilometers to 300 kilometers from base. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">It was a divided <span class="REGION">territory</span> that they shared among the other and it was their <span class="REGION">territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">They would supply to the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">My father, like my uncle, like his son, all were part of the operation who used to, by horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> , deliver goods to the various clients each week. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And this was the means of making a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">It was three generations involved in it -- my grandfather, his children, which that means my father's brothers and sister, my uncle which it was, again, part of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">So, it was a family owned and operated, a closed corporation that all these families lived out of this business.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Just for the record, I don't think you told what your date of birth is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  My date of birth is 19, ah, May 10, 1922.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Well, my personal life was brought up a real strict, devote Hasidic kind of way. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Besides all of that, my father was a Corporal in the Polish Army, during World War II, and life was strictly on a military basis, with the command, you had to do that, you were told to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">If you didn't do it, you had to report. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">So, it was really a strenuous life, that it was in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , especially for me since I was the oldest of four. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I had two more brothers and a sister, who vanished in the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  Did you, you went to a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  I graduated a tri-level school, which it was a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> , influenced by Zionist organization, Mesrah (ph), to which my father was a member and a member of the board on top of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Tri-level because it was Yiddish, Hebrew, and Polish; it was not just for linguistic-sake, but in history and geography and literature and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And later on, I graduated equal to a <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , as we talk about the modern way; the name was Dachkemone (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  Did you have contact with non-Jewish people as well? </span><span class="sentence" id="25">What was the, sort of the population of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  When you talk about scholastically at the time, it was a <span class="BUILDING">sectarian school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">It was strictly boys, without girls, and it was strictly influenced by religion, so it was a boys' religion type of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ; if you wish to call it parochial, would be in place. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">However, from the outside world, we were living on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> for Gentiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">So to say that I associated with Gentile boys, yes, I did, played maybe soccer with them, or just like neighbors sometimes get together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  Did you experience any anti-Semitism in those days?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">As a kid going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , it would have been sort of different as to bring it out in today's world, as we live in, in the 20th century. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">We used to, for instance, to give you an example, going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> early in the morning, carry a lantern, for instance, to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">The boys of the neighbors at that particular time, maybe would walk their dogs or stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And it was nothing odd to see this dog was sent against us. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Although, we were going sometimes two, three kids together, neighbors; or maybe throwing, for the sake of play, throwing a rock at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I did not see friendliness in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I sensed that because the words that would follow it would be sometimes easily recognizable: "dirty Jew." </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And the likes that kids were ready, even at that age, and I'm talking now by the age of seven, eight, nine years of age. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And you probably did not, I did not get the training of hatred, but I felt my neighbors kids do what they did to us was hatred.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  How did you make sense of this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  There was no sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">You do what you've got to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">At times, sometimes maybe you throw a rock back. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And that's when a fight would ensue and you'd come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and have to pay for it because the parents did not like for you to fight on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So, to resist was bad; not to resist was also bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So, it was a mix of no decision and no resolve.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  Before 1939, what did you know about Hitler or Nazis where you lived?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  First of all, it was in our history books in 1933 when Hitler did come and became Chancellor of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So we were aware historical from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Second of all, come 1937 when Hitler drove all the Polish citizen Jews out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where they had to come back, although <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> didn't claim them, but they were Polish citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We were exposed to them real early because our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was about 40 kilometers from <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span> ; in other words, the location would be to go about 135 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kinegsburg</span> (ph) which was <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span> , and we were about 100 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So, for us to see scene at that particular time was a real scene to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">The people came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and they had nothing with them; all they had with them was their belongings that was on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And I remember we would learn as a child that <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> were set up for those people so they could come and have something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And it was cramped <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> for the people that somebody moved in with somebody else and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So the story in 1937 was not just a story that one read in the paper or one heard on the radio if, occasionally you could, because not every <span class="BUILDING">home</span> did have a radio, but you used to listen in sometimes outside near the <span class="DLF">windows</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that did have a radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And it looks like the people didn't mind; they were all aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So it was no longer a story that was told, but it's a story that was seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">It was real; the trap is there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Do you remember your family talking about what was happening or whether there was anything for you to do, or whether it would come to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , these kind of problems?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">It was, a few months later, I'm talking now '37, come '38, this scene became more vivid locally. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">We had the river Nalif (ph) going through our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Nalif</span> <span class="RIVER">river Nalif</span> (ph) going through our city. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And it may sound a little funny that in 1914, during World War I, it was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that was occupying the <span class="REGION">area</span> , not this type of German's that they build a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> that was still considered new in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , crossing that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And at that particular time, the Polish Army started to start building <span class="DLF">dams</span> ; in other words they wanted to flood the on-coming German Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">This is how they thought yet in their minds, that it would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So basically, being that you were a youngster like I was at the time, that in the summertime going to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> which we used to walk and share our fun there, <span class="REGION">areas</span> near the <span class="DLF">beach</span> became restricted because they were building the <span class="DLF">dams</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">So one could not help but see a war, sort of this kind building up. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">We only did not know how long it would take. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So, to answer, as I just stated, we did know something tragic as war will come, but we did not know when.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Now, was there any talk of your family of trying to leave that <span class="REGION">area</span> , or at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  Yes, it was a personal tragedy at my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I lost my mother at that time and tragedy was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">As a gesture, my mother's sister which still alive in here -- she's in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> now -- and her brothers, which with they are no longer alive, tried to save me. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Since she had a letter in her possession, the last letter which I have, with my mother pleading for her to save me and bring me to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">They did send me the papers and as time that I wanted to leave, I didn't make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Hitler beat me to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">By 1939 in September, I was supposed to come for the visa, but September 1, the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So, yes, as I said, we felt it and we knew it, the other tragedy. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Personally at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the size, the eminence of the other tragedy to follow, with Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  Tell me of your memories of the war beginning, in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  The preparation before the war, as I mentioned about the <span class="DLF">dam</span> and the mobilization it started already, in early '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And at that particular time became month by month, the news became as an echo, closer to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , especially like ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">For instance, on <span class="BUILDING">market</span> days, before hostilities had started, we used to have an exchange of German people coming in to purchase their eggs, buy their chickens and so on, because it was an open <span class="BUILDING">market</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was willing, we had an over abundance of food in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they were good customers so therefore, we saw all at once that not so many Germans coming to <span class="BUILDING">market</span> days because <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> did not now want to sell it to them, so before making it a total restriction, there was limitations of how much they could take out, or how much they could buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So, one could sense a change and all of this here affected a little bit of the economy because you were built up and ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">The other <span class="NPIP">part</span> , my father would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with stories telling of sometimes inticinating (sic), stone throwing, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So, on every occasion, being from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , being from for instance religious upbringing, as we used to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I was singing in a choir at that time with one of my friends who were the cantor's children attending the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Yavnev (ph) was the name of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , by the way for the record. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And the tune of the high holiday 1938 was no longer the same as it was in '37 or prior to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">It was sort of more solemnity. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So in every way of life, from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> to going to the <span class="DLF">beaches</span> , one could sense a change all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And you did not have to find out what; everyone was tuned to the news very much and the newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And, in our own family, we started to prepare ourselves and my parents and grandparents remembered that in World War I, our city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stranlinka</span> (ph), which I am speaking of, at the time that I was, we were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stranlinka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Because prior to that, my family were in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , the city of my birthplace, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Astramocietska</span> (ph) involved in the same business as I aforementioned, but they were forced, of their personal matters with one of the partner's bankruptcy, to move and they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stranlinka</span> (ph) in 1929, re-starting again only a family operation, not like before when it was multi-families. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And therefore they decided, since they were remembering that in World War I, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostranlinka</span> (ph), the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was totally burned down by Lastrovmazofyetsky (ph) not having a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> nearby, not having the main station railroads remain quiet, so they decided that probably the war would not reach in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lastrovmazofyetsky</span> (ph) but it will be only in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostralinka</span> <span class="DLF">station railroads</span> remain quiet, so they decided that probably the war would not reach in Lastrovmazofyetsky (ph) but it will be only in Ostralinka (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And, as a means of dividing, so they also took are merchandise from our <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> and try to put it in hiding in the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , so in case it gets destroyed here, they'll have something to live on there and vice versa. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So, yes; the family began to know before September | that world, not knowing to us that World War I was going to be named but that some war is going to break out any time, any moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And that was what they decided to do, basically, 1s to divide. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And closer to the war, the family, all of us, were in that city of Lastrovmazofyetsky (ph) and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostralinka</span> they left the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that we were living in, as sort of to the outcome it will be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  So, you all moved back before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">When you talked about going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> were you talking about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostralinka</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostralinka</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  While I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , see again, I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , looks like my parents did not know what to do with me at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So at three and a half years old I was sent to a private, to like a malamet (ph) as we say in Hebrew, which it means a tutor translated into English. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And it was private. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">That tutor had about ten, twelve kids and it still is, I'm of age now, but it's still the picture of that one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and with all the songs surrounding it, you know, with the story of a tutor still 1s very vivid to me to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So, three and a half years of age, I already was a student in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">However, it was again another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">When I reached the age of seven, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was compulsory. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">You had to start at 7 o'clock, at seven years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So therefore, when I reached the age of seven, we were in a new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> already, moving into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostralinka</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="115">At that particular time I was very advanced in my Yiddish and in my Hebrew teachings. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">However, Polish I could speak but I did not know enough to qualify to be in the first grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And since it was a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> , so my father would be involved paying extra money for three years for me to catch up because, according to the exams, I would qualify to go into the third grade, but I did not, they wouldn't let me be in the third grade since I did not know, had enough education in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So my father hired a tutor to tutor me at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in Polish only and with permission, and I was transferred into the second grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">However within the first year and the tutor, I was able to go in immediately, not even finishing the year, to third grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So, it was rough on me even then, already, you know, as it was the rest of my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  What do you remember about the very beginning of war? </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Was your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> occupied?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">At the year that I'm talking about, to make it vivid, it falls out before the high holidays, as we call our Rosh Hashanah, the way it would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So the day before Rosh Hashanah, while we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostrovmazovetsky</span> (ph), that's when the Germans entered the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">That first hello from them that we had was the same very day, within hours, they occupied the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">They started to round up Jews, in other words, coming in with their guns drawn in their hands and you they rouse, "Jew out". </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And we were all gathered at the <span class="NPIP">place</span> over there, where it was the high school, which had a big <span class="NPIP">place</span> <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , which had a big place, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But, I mean the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that was the <span class="DLF">playground</span> that they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And we were made to be seated, hands over our head and the war, I cannot exactly tell you the amount, but there were a few thousand of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">On the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> , we could see a machine gun, a big machine gun drawn. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We were surrounded in <span class="DLF">lines</span> in between, with German soldiers, be they had carbines, some of them had automatic weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And for what reason we were there, what, known knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">But we expected the worst in the position that we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">After an hour of sitting over there, and it's already curfew time near, all of a sudden, looks like it was a command and we were told to get up and round back. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">As we found it out, the next day late, that Army was called to help some on the front line while they were going towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> <span class="DLF">front line</span> while they were going towards Warsaw at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">In the days of the war, it was probably the fourth day of the war, and so take it, more or less, that it was September 4 at that particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And we were driven, sort of to go back to our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and shots were followed, a lot of them were killed on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Like, this year, my father, and as we were split up because we were not together there, and my father was running in another direction and since he was a military trained person, he knew how to go on his stomach and so on, to get out of the fire's way and he, when we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , everybody was there but my father and we took it for granted for that night that probably he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">However, in the morning, he made his way to meet us and it was a joyful thing that my father was not killed, and he told us that story. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">The first day of greeting, we found other casualties, the rabbi of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and a lot of people from the, from one type of <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> near the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , were driven with their shawls, or , as we call it, to the <span class="REGION">area</span> where we had a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We did not have a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostravmazofyetsky</span> , but <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">At the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> there, there were lined up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German cars</span> , that they were asked to wash them with their shawls and then afterwards they were asked to go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">They did not know how to swim, so some of them drowned, you know, we knew right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And when they came out, they were beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So, there were begin some casualties really known. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">We again found out that now, in order to, you cannot buy anything so there was <span class="DLF">lines</span> lined up near the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> in order to get bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And soon enough, the police, the local police, which it was organized with arm bands. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And the Germans started to pull the Jews out of the <span class="DLF">lines</span> that the Jews cannot stay in <span class="DLF">line</span> for bakery goods, to get. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">We immediately knew the expectations to a wait; that it will not get better but it will only bet worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And it was a matter of when.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  What happened next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  The next thing that had happened, a local government came in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">By that particular time, it was about a week later already into the war and the following the holidays it was already , which as you know, it follows Rosh Hashana, Yom Kipper, and five days later, Sucot (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And the family decided to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We went back part, my father, I, and a few more. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">We were afraid to move, to touch the merchandise that was there because it would have been confiscated. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">However before that happened, I must not forget to tell an incident that a rumor had it that leather, shoe leather was hidden someplace because the Poles used, at that time, cooperated very easily with the Germans and the German demands were met. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So if sometimes, they knew who the merchants were and who what, and they were aware that a lot of people were hiding their goods because they were afraid in case, so they couldn't find it and we, for what it's worth, that's my grandparents, both of them, my father and I were among the 10 or 12 hostages that were lined up again and they said if somebody's not going to tell them about where the shoe leather 1s hidden, we will be shot dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So the first time in my life, I had the fear of being almost lined up against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Luck was with us that the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> next to us, the leather was discovered and we were let to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So, sort of to speak it, you were counting your blessings. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So the second time that ever it happened that we were lined up, that we came out whole as far as the family, no casualties. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">But there were casualties already there. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">The chores immediately had started. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">The Jews had to line up on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in a given <span class="NPIP">place</span> and from there cleaning the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and so on was the kind of work that we were ordered to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And, of course, let me not forget to say it was without pay, for pay the billing was in order. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And we decided at that particular time we had to have a paper that allowing us because without a paper who knows who could happen on the way? </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So we managed to get a paper, as refugees, that we were running, during the war to return back to our <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And, the Germans gave, not the Germans but the local, from the <span class="REGION">local area</span> we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And we were on our way back. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And on the way back, every time we were traveling, we were stopped by the Germans and they made us get off from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and start to look but we did not, we did not yet had anything to be heard, until we neared one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , I think it was, maybe, I would say maybe 20 kilometers from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">In that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> lived one of our relatives and he had a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , a general type store and we found out, because we stopped to find out what to do, we found out that they already had a small massacre of the Jews and his family was among them and the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was no longer in his hands because it was confiscated. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So we found out a little bit of mishap on the family right on the way there. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">No sooner had we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostralinka</span> , back to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was not robbed or anything like that; it was still there because the rest of the people in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> were there, so it was sort of like was somebody to watch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So once we were there, again the chores started, the same as over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">My father was ordered and they put him into <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for a day because he was cleaning. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">That was the main chores that Jews were given to do, street cleaning or any of the <span class="BUILDING">office buildings</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And we noticed at that particular time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostralinka</span> that it was less of an uprise, less going on than in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lostravmozavensky</span> , which we found out later the reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">The Soviets were only at that particular time sharing the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , so one part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> at the other end, one day the Soviets would come in, the other day the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So we took it as an interpretation that since the Soviets were part over there, the Germans did not try to act out in the same way as they did for instance in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lostravmozavensky</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">That was never supposed to be belonging to the Soviets so they had a more free hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">That went on for another few days while we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> until one day, it was still the Jewish holidays of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soco</span> (ph), the second days, so the, it was placed notices all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that within ten hours, the Jews are to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Officially it said you could take all the belongings that you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">In our case, since we had a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , so there were three of them so we shared it among the family and besides the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , we tried to manage to take some of our clothing and so on and to leave with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Immediately, the same day, the Poles from farming and the other <span class="NPIP">places</span> came into the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and they were not asking, "Do you sell it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="189">or anything, but they took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was emptied out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> within a few hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And there was known to stop them. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">We tried to open up the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and maybe muster to get a few, some money out of it, of whatever it is, and no sooner we opened up the <span class="DLF">door</span> to our <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , a Polish person brought the Germans here. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">The Germans start to ask who the owners is, I was there with my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">As soon as we realized the questions, we took the first chance and run away from there, back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and that was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So in other words, that was confiscated. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So however, the other <span class="NPIP">part</span> in hiding was, still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lostravmozavetsky</span> , where I and a cousin of mine, in a few months, almost two months later, make a chance and cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> with the horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , dressed as farmers and we make an attempt, the Germans almost caught up with us and we salvaged some merchandise from there, from the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , which it gave us an ability with, money- wise, to have for the first winter that we were over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And it's a long story to tell until we get there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  I have one question. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I'm a little confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">These two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , were they close to each other, because you seem to go back and forth a bit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">ANSWER:  40 kilometers, which, 1n our miles-way, we were talking about 20 miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So you must understand, 20 miles driving with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> is nothing, but with a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> , it would take, with the horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> , you know, it would take a few hours which you would be there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  But, you seem to have the freedom to choose between these two <span class="NPIP">places</span> to go back and forth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  When do you talk about, in the first days of the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Until we were sent out from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , you needed to have a piece of paper, that in other words, you were permitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So once you had a permit, you were stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">They checked the permits but you could move about. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">End of Tape #1 Tape #2</p>
<p>QUESTION:  How long did it take before certain decrees or rules were implemented by the Germans and Poles?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">All the German forerunners were on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">That's how they were, that was their infantry, starting with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> and then <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and so on and armor would follow them. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Immediately, their crews would post posters on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lighting poles</span> or whatsoever, wherever posters could be posted, telling the new ordinance, what it is: A. That it was curfew hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">B. That the Jews must be identified and must carry identification and in the early part, at least in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , we were supposed to wear a band with the Mark of David, with the Star of David on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And it was told immediately if one is caught, they will be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">That was for anything that one violates, violating the curfew was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">It was immediately declared that Jews cannot walk on <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">So, the identity was the arm band and you must not walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> ; you must walk just on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And the same story was, in reading on further, one would know that Jews no longer can attend any <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , Jews can no longer own any <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> , Jews no longer have rights and that was stating according to the rules of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremborg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Therefore, for the time being, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was not erected as yet, that was not talked about as yet, but they always must report every morning to their assigned <span class="NPIP">places</span> for the assigned work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">So in the first days of entry, when everyone got out of their <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> , running away from the bombings, they were faced immediately with the rules and arm bands affixing and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">QUESTION:  Did you always follow those rules?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">One did not try to there because we saw the consequences how easily it was for a German to draw his pistol and even without anything, can be just target practice and there wasn't a day or anyplace, as soon as they came in, that killings were not going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And they were not re meditated; they just a lot of times were out of laughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And I've seen with my own eyes where a mother and her child were target practice, to shoot, to see that one bullet should kill both of them at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And it was not to save a bullet, but it was just that the rest of the Germans would laugh, you know what I mean, you would see a scene much rather than a murder being committed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  What were the Poles doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">ANSWER:  Well, the Poles at that particular time, please understand, immediately remained as, those who worked in <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> were left working in <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Those who were formerly in the police, a lot of them escaped for fear and a lot of them were drafted to the services, so a new police force was being organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Also they were carrying bands to identify the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So the Poles were pretty much back to their normal lives, whatever they had to do, you know toying around with a new regime, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">But the important thing was, as a Jew, immediately your <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> were confiscated, you know, and if you had lived someplace in a nice <span class="REGION">area</span> , it was nothing to hear new that you were pushed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">But, as I said, that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lostrovmozavetsky</span> , in the first few days; but we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostravlinka</span> as I for mentioned before, things were a little bit different and not so rapidly, due to the fact that we were sharing the Soviets on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and one did not know that they may not occupy the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So, therefore it was a little bit easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">So when it happened, it happened to us rapidly; ten hours and the Jews must leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">When we came to the <span class="DLF">borderline</span> with bayonets they went through our belongings and if like pillows, you saw feathers fly everywhere, so in other words, and if it's anything valuable, they tried, nobody dared to carry open gold or rings or anything like that, because that was confiscated on you there. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So then, you would still get a few biddings and go to the <span class="DLF">borderline</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And there was a no-man's land shortly in that part than over on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">In our group, the family, my grandmother, my mother's father, he spoke Russian yet because he knew to write and to read Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">So he served at that particular time for us as the interpreter and we crossed over on the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">QUESTION:  Now, at what point did you decide to go over on the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">ANSWER:  It was not a decision at what point. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">As I said, when the posters were posted that this is declared to be a city of the Third Reich, according to the Nuremburg laws, a Jew was not permitted to dwell in the Third Reich. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So we were given ten hours, as I said, to move out. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So, as I said, we had ten hours to leave and we had two choices to make: either to go, as we called it at that time, Congress Poland, which it means out of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to any other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , or we could cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> <span class="REGION">Congress Poland</span> , which it means out of our city to any other place, or we could cross the border to the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">The <span class="DLF">Soviet border</span> was remained open for all who wants to cross and to come there. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">That was the part that it helped a lot of people be saved or rather, that 1t saved their lives crossing like my family did. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And that we went on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Continue on. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">We went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> 36 kilometers from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lunja</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And from there, about another 15 kilometers or so was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yedvobno</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="256"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yedvobno</span> translated from Polish to English would be silt; the silt city, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yedvobno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">In that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , our family probably from the shakot (ph) to the rabbi to anybody else was somehow related, you know; second cousin, third cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And the family sort of found ways to get situated among all that family. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So even if it was only one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that it was given to go in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And immediately, we had to register with the police ask so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And youngsters were asked to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because it was September, and the school year was disrupted for a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="262"><span class="BUILDING">School</span> had started. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I enlisted 1n <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at that particular time, again. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Since Russian was not my language, but I had to study so instead of coming in according to my education, I should have at least come into the tenth class because the Russian had a ten-year <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I came in at the ninth with an examination because on everything I tested but Russian and I was back into <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and it started a new life, sort of, in a way feeling of joy, even though everything was left behind and all of a sudden we were supposed to be the proletariat. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And of course, the identity that my father was a businessman was a shameful thing to say, shameful enough that you could have been arrested and sent to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> which the bad thing for one, which like it happened to some of the family, turned out to be good wishes for later, because it since they were sent to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , they survived the war without a lot of these problems that the rest of us had to go through, those who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So, at that particular time, started a new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I, as a young person, was starting again like all young people used to get together after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the evening and it was the Russian system, which they called "Dacadumcrasne ami" (ph), which it means the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the Red Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And the Red Army used to supply dances, sort of in playing, and it was, you know, that was part of their propaganda, how Stalin cares for the youth and Stalin loves us. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And all of a sudden, a new life had started, to listen to politicians talking and voicing opinions that we should learn the constitution of the Soviet Union and that they came to liberate us and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">It was a new lexicon for me and many of us to indulge and I remember it was influenced on me as a young person; after all, I was only 17, going into my 18th year of life and everything coming on so fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So, I remember when I used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , starting to talk politics with my father and tell him the wrongs, the way he was doing before, without realizing, and my father told me, "Wait, son. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">While you're in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and you come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you have a clean <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and you have food to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">It's very nice for you to talk of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">But, when the day will come that you will have to earn your living, you will see who is wrong." </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Because my father, and the rest of the family, first being religious, second they were against communism or socialism to begin with and it was sort of life at a time rolled back to working with them, being <span class="BUILDING">school</span> influenced on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and being influenced on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">For me, I felt good, that no longer I have to go and go attending religious upbringing and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So as I lot of youngsters, you choose what it's easier and better. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And especially, you come at night, and you go out with all the boys and girls and it's dancing, it was sort of a different life without knowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And you know, that was, that's blind thing that it was put up. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Before long I joined even an organization called Soviehem (ph); it was a sports organization so you get involved in sports and it didn't take long, when we were asked to take our passports and after then we took out the passports, things became a little bit more strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">We were restricted as we cannot live 100 kilometers from the <span class="DLF">border</span> which that city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vadlov</span> (ph) was less than a hundred kilometers, you know, to the <span class="DLF">border</span> , so therefore as refugees, we had to start moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So the first time winter we through there, come spring, new problems had started even on the <span class="REGION">Soviet side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Now we had to leave all this family, leave all the people that you knew and move to at least a hundred kilometers away. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">We choose, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Galestov</span> (ph), for instance, was the big center. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Big <span class="BUILDING">centers</span> were forbidden for these displaced persons to live in there and we had to . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">That's how it happened that we came to the Ratchen (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="288">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratchen</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that it was far enough from the borderline and we were permitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">However to get <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> , was again another problem over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">They were not prepared to take in this many refugees.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">QUESTION:  One question before you tell me more about the . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Were you able to continue practicing your religion? </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Were you able to be a Jew under Soviet occupation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  I would say that even at the time, if it was not officially restricted at first, and we are talking about not even a year there, but people were understanding of the circumstances so they did, after escaping the Germans, everything that the Soviets had to offer was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So, therefore, instead of violating the rules so people, yes, did practice in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">It was another way like we were for instance, which I didn't tell at the beginning, on the first day of Rosh Hashana, that we descended in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> at that time, and my grandfather at that time, and on the top, going down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> on the top we put on a piece of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> so it should not be visible in the event the Germans come in to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And I spoke to my grandfather at that time and I say, "Now I understand what they went through in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , in the year the Jews were practicing." </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And he says, "Be quiet my son. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Don't talk now. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Pray to God maybe we'll survive." </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So, that's how deep the religion was in these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">They saw only one way out of it was through religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">So, now when we're on the <span class="REGION">Soviet side</span> , they did practice religion but no longer did I have the discipline that my father would ask me, "Did you pray this morning?" </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Because I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> again and he realized that I'm becoming brain washed with something different so it was sort of a "Don't talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Don't tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Don't ask," situation that I was brought into to live in the new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And, as I started to say at the outset, getting situated in the regimen was not an easy task. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">For instance, a whole family moved into one single <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> next door to a guy who is making harnesses for horses and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> used to be his workman place. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">But it looks like all the bitterness became sweet and everything was well. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">After all, as I said, for the first winter, the merchandise that I and my cousin being risked our lives and brought it in, lasted for that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">But all of a sudden, everybody had to get work. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">My father, since he still had the horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and that gave him a good way hiding than he was not a businessman but he was a working man, earning a living through that. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So now, he used to do with his horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> taking some merchandise from, which they used to call it Soluzatil (ph) which it was scrap metal and so on, and he would have to take it to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to bring it in to the big <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So he had a job for this year and that helped him to do black marketeering while under the cover of this merchandise that he had. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">He would go ahead and smuggle like saccharin maybe, and other things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">So, when you were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sloyen</span> (ph), you would take along some eggs, butter, whatever it is to trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">There was no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Trading was the important thing, and come over there, buy flints for instance, for lighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">That was a big thing because matches were in a scarce <span class="NPIP">place</span> ; getting sole, which it was a very scarcity item or sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So, it was a matter of black marketing. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">It was against the law. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">If you were caught with it, five year <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> was the term. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">But need and the necessity to go on does not get scared by five years imprisonment, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And we went on and at times, at first I still was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , didn't get involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So I tried to go ahead and listen to what they told me in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I involved myself to become a working man. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at that particular time taught you and they kept saying that no matter what we do, we must go ahead to do work. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And I registered to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Galistog</span> (ph) to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I wind up in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> were they were building actually housing for the soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And as a youngster I never did this kind of work before and there I have to take the wood barrels and fill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">After a couple of weeks of work, I thought I'm going to collapse and I returned back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I got a permit and I returned back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I had to find another job. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">My father at that particular time was afraid continuing with the work that he was doing over there, so we decided we are going to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> ; which, this going to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> would build up the future later, serving as a base, that I knew the roots of how to escape from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , although we didn't do it with that in mind, but it turned out to be, yesterday's bad things turned out tomorrow's safety and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">So we came there, over there with a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">We were loading trees that were cut down and taking them from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">The other part behind it was that we worked close to the farmers so we could deal with the farmers and that black marketeering was still a part and before long, my father's influence worked on me that I got involved doing the black marketeering in the same way alongside of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And for a while, we thought that it couldn't be any better because the shortage of food was no shortage to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">We always had enough food to bring <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ; not luxury food, you know, good food that we wanted, but food was around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">So you had bread, you had butter, you had cheese. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">You were able to get a chicken even though you couldn't get your steaks and so on, but you could have a chicken and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And was the other problem was at that time with kosher slaughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Kosher slaughter became a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I did not go into the political part of it, to tell you of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I don't know how much to tell or how much you can give me the time to tell, but talking about kosher slaughter, even through 1937, through a woman by the name of Pristo, Madam Pristo, and she served in Polish Congress. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And she was a humanist. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">She said that killing an animal, as the kosher slaughter was, takes too much time for the animal to be dead; therefore, we were doing an inhumane thing to the animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">So therefore, kosher slaughter should be forbidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">It stirred up a tremendous out pour throughout <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because the Polish constitution of 1918, when they gained independence, and Pilsutsky (ph) at that time being the head, and since the Jews saved his life, he owed a debt to the Jews and he kept all these anti-Semites (ph) in place. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">He couldn't stop them altogether, but he, like a dictator, kept it undercover and control. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">The Jews had elective officials, even to the same as they were called the same, Senate, <span class="BUILDING">house of Congress</span> , as you would call it, you know, and the Senate. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And the law, and it posed tremendous protest. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">But I blame the Jewish leadership for not coming up at that time immediately to squelch all of this here that in turn led to the officials handling black candles and they called a fast that we have to fast and punish ourselves so that God will help us, that this bad law will be change. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Well, we know the outcome, that it didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And the hypocrisy worked on me even as a youngster. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Because why? </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Instead of forbidding the kosher slaughter, we were given a contingency; in other words, you can kill so many so that, in its, tells the wrongs. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">If it is right to kill 100 pieces of cattle, why is it wrong to kill 150 or 200. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So in it, one so blatantly, that anti-Semitic out burst against the Jews, even though they were constitutionally protected, that it's a part of religious ritual to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">So know, on the <span class="REGION">Soviet side</span> , all people who are before, remembered this here case and no one sort of dared to make an issue of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">However, kosher slaughter still went on in hiding, as sort of to speak that if you want a chicken to be slaughtered properly kosher, you could, there was somebody who would do it for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">But, it sort of, since the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> were small and the NK VD as we called it at that time, or KGB did not penetrate so much and the local people were working in the government so some how rather, it was "Hey, I don't see it." </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And, of course, in many instances, you paid off for all of these goodies doing it in the say way. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">So, religiously, again, which it was a big upheaval for people like in my family at that particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And I as a youngster, did not feel the hurt so much because I was young and foolish as the saying would be, not understanding tomorrow, you know, what it is going to bring on us later. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">So, as I said, I already got the taste of the coming Soviet working and being privileged to find out at that particular time, that in the Soviet Union, workmanship was by right; in other words, the bricklayer did not earn as much money, or maybe more money as the guy who was mixing the cement. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">So, it was not the Soviet system of socialism but it was again, capitalism. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">In the capitalistic system, we know there are different rates of pay, even for the same work. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So, I began do get a little doubt in the system to what is going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And that was own a year and a half on this sort of living conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I still was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I came back from <span class="REGION">Devon</span> (ph) back into <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and all of this kind of life lasted, as I said; with working in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> and doing all the means. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And at that particular time, I used to talk to my family, why don't they try to go ahead, go move further east, but their mind was that the work cannot be a lasting one, that the war should be over and we'll be able to return back to the <span class="REGION">area</span> that we had to run away from. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">However, the 22nd of June, all of the dreams of yesteryears became too evil for that same day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">QUESTION:  1941?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">ANSWER:  1941, the 22nd of June, Hitler attacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I don't want to have to put it in, but maybe we have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">If anyone's seen on television not so long ago, it was brought the story back to life, the way Stalin was forewarned about all the things that Hitler was going to attack but it did not want to listen to and he even went away and executed some guys, calling them propagandists and until the war broke out, he didn't want to believe that that would be the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">That's a point I want inserted because it's a true fact, the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">He began to see it immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">The local population then, in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> (ph), that I was, we were hiding from the bombings, when the Germans attacked and they kept saying they wished the Germans would come in already. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And after us telling them we already experienced the Germans, I hope that the Russians shouldn't lose and be able, because at that particular time it was a few days the Soviets, a few days the Germans, until it was settled. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Because within ten days at that particular time, it had reached almost near to be the Mensk (ph), you know, and Hitler at that particular time was the blitz , it was named, that he'll be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> within ten days. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And he almost succeeded, you know, to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So things began to turn real fast in a different way. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Again, at this time, in '41, like it happened in '39, the first thing when the Germans sent it in the Rachen, the Jews were called to meet on the <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the center. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">The center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> of small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , like in most cases in the United States also, have also, you know, they call it the <span class="DLF">plaza</span> over there, what we call the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> also, have also, you know, they call it the plaza over there, what we call the marketplace or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So that was usually the center for the Jews to be gathered. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And they drove us out over there and, again, if you want to call it a miracle be it; to me it is a miracle but it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">While a man, a German uniform went out and spoke to us in perfect Russian and he was a, I believe a captain, if higher, spoke to us in perfect Russian and started to tell us about the new law and all of us were searched and if anybody has jewelry or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">So, we had a taste right away early to put it up and all of a sudden while we were there, looks like, you know, a piece of artillery that it was the wrong way, hit the corner part of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and when that hit and another one followed, the Germans started it and they were being attacked now, so we were dismissed. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">But the machine guns were surrounding us at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">We were not there to listen to speeches. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">We were there to follow through. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">They started to segregate all doctors needs to go to one <span class="NPIP">side</span> ; you know, the right and left, if you ever heard about it, that's what, we were a part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">To the right, to the left; no one knew whether the right <span class="DLF">line</span> is the right <span class="DLF">line</span> or it is the wrong <span class="DLF">line</span> , you know, to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And you had no choice about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">They would go ahead and look, right, left, and every time they was said, was always with a and that saved us, that explosion from this here artillery piece and all of a sudden the Germans were starting to run around like mice and we were returned back to our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Until a couple of days later, the <span class="DLF">front line</span> started to come for fuller, the Soviets, whatever was left, retreated and that was when life under the occupation with the Nazis began. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">A <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span> (ph) was formed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">A <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span> means actually a government -- it was not appointment. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">It wasn't even elected but then, we would line up. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">He would point the finger to one, he would go out to the right or to the other one and they would appoint about maybe ten people. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Then they told them, "You are the Univad," and they said, "You are going to be the president and this is where we'll begin to have a government," and a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">So, for the first time, a new life starts again, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ; which it meant they mapped out a few blocks of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which could house only probably a tenth or maybe less than a tenth of the population, and it was with barbed wire surrounded all the way around, with <span class="DLF">doors</span> and we had the police, the local police which they assigned to; it used to be on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">The Germans could always go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> to the police, but the restriction was for farmers or Gentiles to go inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">We could only go out with a "shine" as they used to say in German; in other words, a paper which was a permit and groups used to be started in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">We would line up near the <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span> ; these ones are going, those are the carpenters. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">They're going to do carpentry work. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Those are the electricians, going for electrical work. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">The other ones we'll send to cleaning the various types of <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> or the <span class="DLF">streets</span> or whatever ensued later, like 1t was winter for instance, to go to clean the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">End of Tape #2 Tape #3 A.... arithmetic of the case, since Jews were only 10 percent of the population, how come so much anti-Semitism could reach. (</span><span class="sentence" id="410">Another speaker, unintelligible.) </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Amoshik (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="412">So it could not be right. (</span><span class="sentence" id="413">Another speaker; "They wouldn't have to kill anybody.") </span><span class="sentence" id="414">It means the three half million people, all turned onto families. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">The families, let's say make it 3 or 4 per family, so it would be a fourth of that would have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">So they should have been. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  I think you were talking about (unintelligible)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  Life in the Rachen (ph) on the occupation and with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and Univad (ph) in full swing, brought new problems and killings day by day. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">They were not killings because they were called for, but it was the criteria I have aforementioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">If a policeman wanted to have fun, he killed a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Or, when he was working something and if he did not work as fast as the policeman told him to do, that was a good way to basically not shoot him, but beat him to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">So everyday used to go on in the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I had in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with me a brother to my father who he was, in part, responsible for helping me with my religious education and he was a graduated rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">We still used to, by his demands, when I would come from work and we used to sort of talk about the Torrah, a little bit here and then the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">All of that was very distasteful at the time to me, but I loved him enough to listen to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">He's the man at that particular time came to me since maybe I didn't mention, and I use that word, "ota defid" (ph), you know what I'm referring to? </span><span class="sentence" id="427">That's a French saying for "burning" and that was sort of burning on display. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">All religious scripture, be the Torrah, be books and everything, were ordered by the Germans to be making in a bonfire which they had burned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">They were so scared for knowledge that people could be aware that this was, again, a part of showing to the Jew which it belonged to a part of the de- humanization program. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Because, you must remember that we went through certain stages. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">As I have aforementioned before, the laws of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremburg</span> were the first laws to give them the guide. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And in these laws, a Jew was not a human. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">A Jew loss all his rights and therefore he was a person without rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">So, the same as I have aforementioned before, when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> started, it was the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , a Jew could walk every <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">But even by marching to work or doing your chores that you were ordered to do, the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> was forbidden for a Jew to walk on. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So,....</p>
<p>QUESTION:  You mean <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ? ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">ANSWER:  Outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Even while you were doing your duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">The only time he could walk out was when he had a broom in his hand and sweeping the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> so therefore. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">But otherwise, this was forbidden for Jews to walk on those <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Every time you saw a German, a Jew was asked that he must salute him and say "Good morning" and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">If you didn't, that was good enough cause for the Germans to beat you, kill you, or whatever it is because we had no rights, so he did not have to bring in front of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">You were executed on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Quite often when the killings went on, I would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and talk to my uncle and say, "Look, I'm very despondent today. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I've seen a child being molested and killed." </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Or, "I've seen another instance where that happened." </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And basically, that was, then the dig. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">They started to do a dig at that particular time in the out skirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">A <span class="DLF">pit</span> big enough for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , mind you, to go around and turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And that ultimately was supposed to be the burial places that was intended for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but it did not happen that way because of the Protestants in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , which I'm going to get to it a little bit later, when we get to talk about the Protestants. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">But, right now, I'm only trying to touch base with life and what went on, the kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Let's say when the winter came, a lot of Jews were killed and lost by sending them to go ahead to clean the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And they did not have the proper equipment. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">The Germans didn't provide shovels, it was our job that we, the Univad (ph) of the Jews had to have shovels. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And to get tools at that time, 1t wasn't like you go into a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and buy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">You paid dearly through the local population to get it for you because Jews could not travel around and go to purchase things. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So, in order to purchase things, that's what you had to do, the outside connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Another thing which I do not want to leave out: the creation of the <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span> , a new thing and a new word began to make its <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">The word was called "contribution" . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Now, in the normal language when we use a contribution in the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , we talk about a donation. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">You contribute something to a welfare, to a cause. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">That word "contribution" was done exactly opposite; that was a punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">In other words, it means the <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span> could be called and was beat up to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of the Gestapo and they were given an order that within, for instance, ten hours for so, this community, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is to write one kilogram of gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">They did not care whether you had the gold, but if you didn't have the gold, they wanted a kilogram of gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Maybe they were successful to bring 14 ounces; they accepted the 14 ounces, and but on another contribution, which in other words. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">So, little by little, all the laws began to be of that nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Jews cannot wear leather shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Jews cannot wear any leather clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">So, in other words, all of this type; if you had boots or you had shoes with leather, you had to turn that in. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">So all of this here was the part of the dehumanization program and the part of breaking us morally and shy away how to resist the enemy, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">So you haven't got this and you haven't got that and you can't get the others and before long, and we used to have to come every morning and stay in <span class="DLF">line</span> to receive the amount of ounces of bread prescribed. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">In other words, it wasn't a matter that you go out to buy, but it was a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> and the Jews used to be delivered bread and the bread was not made of flour. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">If you heard stories that were, you know, putting in sanding from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> , you know, things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">It was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">It was like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And that the Jews had to pay for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Labor, you didn't get paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">So you used to go through all of this here, stay in <span class="DLF">line</span> to get the ration for the day of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So food became a problem, and talking about smuggling was again an issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Since my brother used to know the farmers, that he used to speculate before with the Russians, now he used to, as a child it was easier; he was four years younger than I was, so we split up at that particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I was with the family of my father's and my brother, my two brothers and my sister went to live together with my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">My grandfather on the father's side was dead; he died already. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">But my grandfather from my mother's side was still alive and he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">So he was together with his son and his wife already was dead, left a child behind and then he had the three children, his grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">So my brother used to be the one who would steal his way out and if my uncle would find something that he should give him to trade for food, he would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And as a kid, but he was very well equipped to be able to do it because necessity at a time mother of invention and since we had to make the life of black marketeering, you know, that's what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I did not tell you this point, that at this time in my life my father was no longer alive here. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">As I aforementioned before, that my father used to go ahead and carry on the sayuzatil (ph) which is I said metal scraping, to he used to have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonum</span> (ph) with it, a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> (ph), and in the meanwhile he used to be able to take passengers along who would pay him money and they were also black marketeers. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">So it happened in that winter of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Now, I got to be careful; not the winter of '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">It was the winter before the Germans; it was the winter of 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">So while he was traveling to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonum</span> , at that time was a big snow, we had maybe 10 to 12 inches of snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And halfway, the horse couldn't pull the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> anymore because he was sinking, like there was no route yet made, so he decided to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">A friend of his who 1s still alive in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> today, who was the firsthand story to tell me how it happened, so he decided to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And he came back; I jumped up from my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> listening. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">It was something terrible to hear, you know, that he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I was wondering what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And he told me that it is impassable, the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and he decided to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">He was a hauset (ph), like I say, in a lot of Hasidic way, prejudiced about some of these here things. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">For instance, you don't go back the same way; if you forgot something in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and you came out to get it, they wouldn't go back the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">They got to go back the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">So why do I say that? </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Because two of the passengers kept insinuating (sic), "Why don't we go back?" </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Instead of being the <span class="DLF">wall</span> behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> , and if the horse stops, you help him. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And some how or other, my father listened to their pleas and he decided to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So afterwards it happened when the horse got stuck, it did not have a whip on it or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">He went over to the first <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , broke off a branch and came over and the horse wouldn't pull and he hit him, the horse, and the horse pulled up his left foot and hit him right in this <span class="NPIP">part</span> (point to his head) which actually, the way the doctor told me later, he busted an inside artery, you know, and he was bleeding internally. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">When he came back for the second time from the turn and he was already laying, crying, I immediately took him to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with calling the doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And the doctor told me that it would be the best cure for him if we could get him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonum</span> (ph) to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> because he'll need surgery; he's bleeding internally. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">He was a strong man, my father, that he could hold pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And no matter how much effort by morning I tried, that the Red Army should take him with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> to the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">No matter how much influence I tried to use, and I did not have the influence to take him and within 24 hours, he was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">So I had the second personal tragedy awaiting me after all this year that now my father remarried after my mother's. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">He remarried in 1938 and here we're talking about three years later, that we thought that it was a good thing it happened to us because the stepmother, she was very good to my younger brother and the others, and my sister, and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> began again to be in order. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">SO we were very appreciative to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And as I aforementioned, I, at the time, thought that I'm going to leave for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">So know it looks like trouble followed trouble, one after the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">So this time, while we are there and we're doing all this here black marketing, my father is dead now. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">But the family's got to go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">His father was still alive and he was so proud of me that I can go and keep the family together. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">It looks like he couldn't die until I would be back. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">On his dying <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , he kept on talking, "Where's Harold?" </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And, it's when I came back, I used to travel by night and came that morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">My stepmother said to me, "You better hurry to see grandpa; he's in bad shape and he keeps asking." </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I came to his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and he was hardly breathing but he recognized me, hugged me and within a few minutes, he was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">We had a <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> where my grandpa was living at that time, the Soviets, and I called the doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">He was in right away and it was all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">So both of my grandparents were fond of me in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Now, this grandfather from my mother's side had his love for me in another way. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And with him, he was behaving well until one day, he wanted to go commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And suicide, by Jews, religious Jews, is a no-no. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">He couldn't take all that was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">He couldn't take his life, his religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">So somebody stopped and they saw what he was doing, that he was trying to cut his arm and they started yelling and then my uncle got him back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we started to calm him down. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">But, the man lost his and he couldn't go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">All of that took place until I was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">The story starts like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">QUESTION:  I just wanted to get a sense of time for clarification. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">This is, was, all of these episodes you're talking about prior to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> being formed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">ANSWER:  What I said about my grandfather was prior to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> being formed. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">My father's father, when he said he couldn't die until I was to his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , now I'm talking about my other grandfather who also was fond of me and he, looks like, wanted to commit suicide by not being able to see life what had been ensuing in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">You follow me now? </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Because, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , as I told you, my brother would risk his life and go out to get a little food to keep for them going. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I had to go working and a few times then round ups were, by that time I already built a hide out in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION:  Let me ask you a few questions about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="547">How did your brother get back and forth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">ANSWER:  As I say, he would steal his way out, as a kid, and you know, he was four years older than me and even the other kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And if he would go sometimes with a <span class="DLF">line</span> up of the people who were marched out to go to work, he would crawl in to there. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And who these days, on the Jewish side, from the <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span> <span class="REGION">Jewish side</span> , from the Univad (ph) cared that they saw another guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">They were not accountable that much, so he would go with us on that <span class="DLF">line</span> and in the meanwhile, he would get lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">QUESTION:  Were the Univad and the Jewish police, were they --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">ANSWER:  In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we did not have Jewish police. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">The Jewish police was in the bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettoes</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> (ph), Veilostok (ph), large, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">But in the smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> there, we are talking about a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> right now that prior to World War -- to the outbreak of the war probably, maybe, had 3,000 people in total population. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">So, you know, and then there was an influx of the refugees, you know, more like the way I said that we came. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">At the time when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was created, some Jews escaped from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettoes</span> and they came in here. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So, our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I would say from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> at that particular time, when we are talking about in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> (ph) probably must have been maybe 2500 or 3,000 people of population in all. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , there was no more than about a thousand to 1200 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">QUESTION:  Were the members of the <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span> good to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Were they good people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">ANSWER:  That's a bad question and you'll please forgive me for saying this. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Serving in a <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span> could never have been a good and bad question because when the Gestapo imposed that you have to deliver and they used to have to go from <span class="DLF">door</span> to <span class="DLF">door</span> and really knock on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and say, "You are going to turn it over or we have to turn the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> apart and you are going to have to give it if you have gold, or if you have money." </span><span class="sentence" id="564">You know, they were searching and doing partially before their scheme, and second of all, that was the only way you could do it in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">It was not a matter that someone was going to go to their <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> and take out, you know, what I mean, from the hiding and take out his gold or money. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">There was no such thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Anything what anybody has, was told all the time in hiding, people would have buried some things that in case they're searched or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">We had to go ahead to buy things from the local population or through them to satisfy the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">So we didn't have gold but there was money available to be gotten together, American dollars or whatever these people had it, so the means was that the Germans did not look for us to better ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">They would come at the worst, they can make how much more miserable in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> could become. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And this was part of the, as I used that word, the dehumanization program that it went out to suck, like to say sucking our blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Picture when you cannot wear, the men cannot wear -- the fur that men used to wear was inside fur. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">I'm not talking about the people of old Mensk (ph), you know, but the average person. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Used to take from a lamb skin this <span class="NPIP">part</span> if it was a healthy one, so he had it to the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> finished, you see, and so it was sewn in things and it was decorative and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">But the poor guy had something else, a fur lining 1n there to keep him warm because that was a good item to keep away from the cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Now you had to turn all of that in. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">So, what I did, I had a piece of fur in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> coat and I took that and sewed on a lining to cover it. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Sure you tell me, Harold, what would happen if they would discover it? </span><span class="sentence" id="579">If they discovered me with it, I'm dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I ran away to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> with that thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">But, you have a risk to life. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">This is why I still say to this day, not only were we heroes in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , everyone in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , everyone in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> who managed to survive, is a hero because that was exactly anti- what Hitler wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">So no matter by what means, that one could prolong life and survive, that is the heroism that the people of our stature like myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Sure, I am happy that I went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> and had the opportunity to lead a platoon and to go ahead and do diversionary work like burning <span class="DLF">bridges</span> , downing <span class="DLF">railroads</span> , as I get to it a little bit later. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">But every time I could, of not giving the enemy what they wanted out of me, I already was a hero at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And so, getting killed; sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">That's what the meaning was. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">That's what we were waiting for. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And the people of sound sense knew about the time that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">However, a lot of people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettoes</span> still believed that a miracle or something will happen and they will be able to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">But, those who are hoping for the survival to come, like this here, did not survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Those who acted in no means or ways, we would have run away, did whatever they did, survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">No 100 percent, but a bigger percentage survived and that's what it was the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">So, as I was saying at that particular time, I, my little family was split and my brother was helping out. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">He was the helping hand there. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And then one morning, which I had that chapter in my own manuscript, the 33 pages. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And I called it my "Escape to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Forest</span> <span class="FOREST">Forest</span> " and I want to tell you in detail right now how that came about until I came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="598">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I want you to tell me all that, but I just want to ask you a little bit more about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">ANSWER:  Good. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">You go ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">You're commanding me and I'm listening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">QUESTION:  Within this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I know it wasn't a big <span class="NPIP">place</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lojur</span> (ph) and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Was there any semblance of normal life, in terms of friendships or activities? </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I'm trying to get a sense of what it was like living there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="606">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">The important thing, the life, for instance, picture yourself at a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , for instance, of European standard, at the <span class="REGION">area</span> where I'm referring to. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">A <span class="BUILDING">house</span> consisted of maybe two or three <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Now, these two or three <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , if a family was living there with 3 or 4 kids, was not accommodating, as you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Picture that same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> now, putting in ten families. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Now, you picture ten families, ten families cramped into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Somebody's going to pick on someone. "</span><span class="sentence" id="613">How come you snore?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="614">How come you keep waking up in the middle of the night?" </span><span class="sentence" id="615">So therefore, when you say, when you use that word normal, that's a word impossible to refer to at that era because that's what the Nazis planned. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Then you are going to be so cramped in, you're not going to be able to live with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And that's what they want. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Therefore, you cannot unit; therefore you cannot do all these things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">So, during the day men and women were out at work and it was not bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">But, at night, can you picture; it's like sardines in the cans. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Kids, no kids, everything was together. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">There wasn't a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Even if there was one <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , I mean one <span class="NPIP">part</span> , and if somebody could go ahead to boil some water. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">It was all tragedy; where do you get the wood to use to make, you know, the firewood. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">To have to prepare everything became a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And know, who's going to be first to use, if they had some things. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">If they had some food, they had to hide it because somebody will take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">They did not take it with a gun or a stick; they'll take 1t one way or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">So all of this here, to use that word as I said before, the <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span> ; no, the <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span> was not made to please the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">The <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span> was a sign for the Germans to have a conduit between them and every dweller in them and they would put out the clothes, for instance they needed to have a count. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Everyday they had to present a count. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And when somebody died, to go ahead and take them for burial, again, that was all going through. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">There was one thing about it, they did keep good records, the Germans, and they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">However we out smarted them. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">No <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ever had the amount of Jews in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">It always had less in their ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So therefore, I'm coming to what I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Food was the big problem to cause and why it was because we knew it from here and from the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">There are too many Jews in this so they have to kill. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">So when they killed out, just for the sake of talk, if a thousand people were, according to the accounting, was over there with the Nazis and they killed out 500, all of a sudden if you were to take a head count, really, you'd find out there was probably 700 to 800. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">So, how many to keep up the lease and how to keep that, was never a factual thing that everybody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">But everyone looking around him could see from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that all of a sudden we had another few people that was not here. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So, it was dog eat dog and everybody was not telling the truth to each other because you couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Everybody shivered; they were scared for their own head. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">You never knew when it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And on the other hand, it's very hard for me to make a person understand how we did not become insane and all of us lose our senses, to kill ourselves off first. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Do you follow me? </span><span class="sentence" id="648">When I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> in March of 1948 and I gathered with my wife to the family, until 2 o'clock in the morning when I told them. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">The question came, "So, how did you survive?" </span><span class="sentence" id="650">and, "Since it was so terrible, did you tell us a story or, we believe what you told us is true, so how did you survive?" </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And this is the miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">If you believe in miracles, every survivor survived by way of a miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">He was not that smart; he was not that schooled. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">He had plans and that helped him survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">If you have a more questions about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I will gladly fill you in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">QUESTION:  You, so I think what you are saying 1s that you didn't resembled the <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span> ; they did what they had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Is that what you are telling me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I personally, I speak for myself in this case and I hope every person who I'm saying understood them. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">That's why we listened and we tried to do what they wanted us to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">QUESTION:  Another question, when we've changed take place, 1s were you able to practice your religion at all during the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">ANSWER:  There was no such thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I said it to you the story about my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I did not get to tell you the rest of that, that by his demands, I took as we call a shatz (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="665">A <span class="DLF">shatz</span> is six of the, you know, the Homaj (ph), the Tomat (ph) and all of that, and he had all these books and I told you about the alta dufar (ph), he made me take a whole set which it was a Torrah and other religious things and I built it underneath the <span class="DLF">roof</span> to make a double and put it in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Again, as I aforementioned, would they find it what would they do? </span><span class="sentence" id="667">They would kill. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">But they'd kill anyways. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">But I pleased him to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">I liked him and I discussed with him some of the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Like he would tell me at one time, and when I told you when I came there was killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">He said, "Look, you are a student," he said to me. "</span><span class="sentence" id="673">And you are a very good student. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">You remember what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , that what they did to the Jews and all of that." </span><span class="sentence" id="675">He says, "God had an opportunity at that time to play with the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> because they were devoted. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">He knew that they will not put him down. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">But can you imagine if the Jews of today were to give a choice, what would happen?" </span><span class="sentence" id="678">he said. "</span><span class="sentence" id="679">What would happen?" </span><span class="sentence" id="680">This is how much devotion he, my father, my grandfathers, all of these here people, there was no "ifs". </span><span class="sentence" id="681">There was, that is the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">End of Tape #3 Tape #4</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I will have to come to you to tell you about my escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">This is how, we called it a selection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">If you're going to get to that, that's fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">You mentioned something that I just wanted to ask you about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">ANSWER:  Did we have that story part about hiding their religious things on the tape before? </span><span class="sentence" id="688">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">We didn't put it in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">QUESTION:  Okay so, you were talking about your uncle?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">ANSWER:  I often used to, after work, have discussions with my uncle, not about my wanting to, but by his making me talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Maybe in his way, it was a means of keeping my moral going instead of down. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And he would talk religious things. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">In one particular day that I vividly remembered, and we were working already that day about digging the big <span class="DLF">pit</span> as I have aforementioned before. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And I literally had seen on that particular day, some gross, inhumane ways of the way a policeman, because the way it used to be over there, there was maybe two Germans and maybe 10 or 12 from the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">That's the way it used to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">They used to use a couple of Germans and the local people who were drafted as policemen or so on, they were the ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And, of course, they had the "life of Riley;" their family, nothing was done to their families but good things and all that they robbed from Jews were free for them to, for their families to have and to enjoy. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">So, that particular day, I had seen a if you occasions where the guy was bidding the guy at work for no other reason but just his blood-thirstiness was in him to show off to the German that he needs to be promoted because he is doing, really, the job that the Germans wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">So, then he started beating on that particular person. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">It was at first, you know, the guy was starting to yell; the more the guy yelled, the harder the beating went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">So, if you could make sort of to yourself or a thing to remember; when they beat you, you perhaps don't cry so much, so they don't get the enjoyment, realizing how much you hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">So, if you didn't cry at all, they beat you a lot; if you did cry a lot, they beat you a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">So which way to choose? </span><span class="sentence" id="705">You had no way to choose. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">If you survived, you survived and if you didn't, you were left maybe to bleed to death or whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And then they would ask some Jews, to ask the Jews to go ahead to the <span class="BUILDING">burial place</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">burial place</span> could be anyplace, and put them in there, as a reward to them, they were shot and they would bring up. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">So sometimes it used to be going up. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I remember times when they used to bring the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> in our <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="710">In our <span class="REGION">area</span> , they experimented a lot of things but few, if ever, were taken to the main concentration camps as we know, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenvald</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> as we know, the Auschwitz, the Buchenvald (ph) or the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Of course, we found an uncle's brother first and he related that he was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sladen</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> aforementioned, and he was taken among many more. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">So, I don't want to rule it out, so I say it the way it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">In our <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we did not know or any round ups that were made to that I them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">QUESTION:  Did you know about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">ANSWER:  We didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">We didn't, in our <span class="REGION">area</span> , until we did not get out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , and we found out that Jews were remaining a life and they were in concentration camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">The important thing, when I use that word "dehumanization" was another part; lack of communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">The Jews could not get papers, the Jews could not hear anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">But every ghetto Univad would pay basically to send Gentiles to the Slovan (ph) ghetto or to the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to find out what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">What everybody wanted to do was to learn a lesson: how to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Unfortunately, they paid their way and the survival was not in place because what they did not ghetto in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonya</span> , not necessarily did they do in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jatel</span> (ph) or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> or someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">They wanted always that surprise, that different way so Jews did not have an opportunity of surviving or resisting. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">They did it both ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">They used to get the round ups where all the population was driven out, even the Valde Univad was to the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> <span class="BUILDING">Valde Univad</span> was to the marketplace, and line up over there and it was the right, left, right, left idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And one morning, that's what it was the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And I usually knew one man in the <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span> quite well because he happened to be a personal friend for many years from before the war of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">He was a personal friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">So a lot of times when a round up used to happen, since he was in the <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span> , I would go ahead to ask him whether the <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span> has any knowledge what's going to take place. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">That round up, what it happens to be now, I've been denied before somehow or other the rumors; rumors were, all the time we were living with rumors, all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And the rumors one day happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="731">QUESTION:  When was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">ANSWER:  That's still I'm talking about in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> like before. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Year, approximately again, because I escaped in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">So we are dealing with the era within '41 and ' 42, May. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">See, that's the interim period, that's when I'm talking ghetto life, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Because I escaped at that particular time, about this time of year, more or less, which is April; that's when I escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">It was like the spring of the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">We did not have calendars, believe me, to know exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">So I went to him, Veinstock (ph) was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And he says to me, Harold, you don't know anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Because, I, on a number of occasions, had my <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> where I used to not show. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And therefore I wanted to know at that time, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">My horse that I had, by that time was gone already. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">I did not have any horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="745">So, I did not, I couldn't go; I had to do the different kind of chores that I did before, so I wound up at that round up in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">That morning they all came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Fritz was the name of the head from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , from the Gestapo by us, and he used to be a lover of horseback riding. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And he came out with a big whip in his hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">The whip they didn't use for the horse, but that whip, that used to be his best way. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">That was a special love affair, it looks like for them, beating a person much more than shooting or killing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">They used to have their victims done so that they begged to be dead because that's how they used to. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And we were made <span class="DLF">lines</span> and in every <span class="DLF">line</span> , there were police in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">So, I mean, you had a police line in this <span class="DLF">line</span> <span class="DLF">police line</span> in this line, you had a <span class="DLF">police line</span> , and we were the column together. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">So you couldn't move or you couldn't turn and at one times that's what we were told to do and we were searched, sort of displicably, to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And at first they would say, "Anybody who has knives or any weapons to throw them out," you know. "</span><span class="sentence" id="756">If found, will be shot." </span><span class="sentence" id="757">We were, at that particular time, picked out approximately 350, give or take, or 400, all young people in most cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Some middle aged people, too, the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">When the selection, it used to be called selection, as it's known; when the selection ended, Fritz on his horse, some police and Germans on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> formed a column on the side and we were told to run, who knows where? </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Before long, we knew we were running on the <span class="DLF">street</span> that was leading to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonov</span> (ph) and of course, they were changing all the guys who were, for instance, keeping us and running alongside of us, were given a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> that were following and stuff like this, so they got in case we got worn out. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And our guys from the running and beating each time, you would see a few guys were left on the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Those who were left on the side were left. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">In other words, if some of them survived and could escape someplace is a question because behind were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , they could see and they had their machine guns tuned easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">So I don't know what happened because I was not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">What I saw, the way of the scenery went up, we were driven all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonum</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Slonum between the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rechen</span> was approximately about give or take about 40 kilometers, and 40 kilometers, as I say, is less than 20 miles, but you just take and start running under the circumstances for the 20 miles and you just see what is left of that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">So, the majority I would say, if at all, we were left about 150 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">That would have been -- I did not count, so I don't want to put the finger, and it was given to me, but were driven into the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="769">In that <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> we found people from other surrounding small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> around who were also, probably been through a similar situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">A Gestapo man came in in order to keep quiet and we shouldn't talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">That was the means, a shot was fired.

"</span><span class="sentence" id="1009">Take it to him and he'll have to sew on something for me." </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">Really, that was just an excuse for me to sort of see him for the last time, which it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">He did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">He took my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> coat there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">I didn't go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> but my youngest sister or brother, I couldn't face them anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">As soon as he left the coat, I saw him from a distance; I saw the guys scatter because there's one thing I told him, when you come, do not come as a group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">You must come distantly seeing each other, not as a group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And they listened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">As soon as I saw him, I ran in and I took the, no, I took the coat from him before he had gone into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , from the tailor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">I says, "I must go someplace right now." </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">And I ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">End of Tape #4 Tape #5</p>
<p>ANSWER:  We would know that no matter how much there is, when singled out, it never was in any catastrophe, or in any event what it happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">If everybody could think positive, obviously, Hitler would never be able to succeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">But because he could divide and conquer . . (</span><span class="sentence" id="1023">empty space in the tape) . . </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">to give all the time, about the fights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And mind you, that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> , as partisans we occupied later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">We held it for three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">But, this little group of mine that we come to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , could not convince the commander to attack it before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">Later, after the massacre we attacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">Okay, I know where I stopped right now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1030">QUESTION:  Oh, you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1031">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1032">QUESTION:  Good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1033">ANSWER:  As I aforementioned, to relocate my story right now, my rest of the guys, two men and one young lady, were getting to the point where we are to meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">I met with them and I said, "Now, it's a little bit too light yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">I did not want anyone to see that we are going to have to dig our way out underneath the <span class="DLF">wires</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">So we must wait until dusk comes, a little bit darker." </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">And I know people were not on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in those days, in other words. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">But still and though for the if and I wanted to dig out my bayonet from underneath there for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">So I waited until it turned a little bit darker and we started with our bare hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">We did not have no shovel; with our bare hands to dig a <span class="DLF">path</span> underneath because it was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , that's on the other end, and it was the time of year when it wasn't frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">And we made a dig over there so that we were able to lift up the wire and one by one, we slid on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , pushed back the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> to demarcation, so it should not be a mark seen that someone was doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">And, we immediately went to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I said I had put my bayonet in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">And I had a part of a piece of grass over there that I knew once I pulled it out, I wouldn't have to dig because I wanted to be on the ready with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">I got my bayonet, put on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> "and everybody held whatever they had with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">That's all we had, was coats. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">We didn't have anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">And we started on our way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">I knew my directions and I therefore, at this time I'm explaining it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">I says, "Look straight ahead and you'll see from a distance the lights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">That's where the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">We cannot go this way straight because we may run up on police or Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">So, what we will have to do is go out of way until we cross the main <span class="DLF">road</span> leading from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zulva</span> (ph) to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonya</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">That was the main <span class="DLF">artery road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">Once we crossed the <span class="DLF">road</span> , we have to go to the other <span class="NPIP">position</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">So, I explained to them that that's going to be, and I explain to them that that's going to be, and I tell them, "We are not going to go like a column, but we're going to be spread out." </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">So, the four of us, in case someone sees, you know, should not be able with one shoot to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">So, we will keep distance, distant enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">We will not talk loud at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">If you have to say something to somebody, come over, make a marker to stop and we'll talk because we definitely do not want anyone to hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">The language that we will talk will be Russian and, in part, we will talk Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">So, that 1f somebody should hear us, should hear any of the two languages; but definitely, by all needs, no Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">To camouflage our whereabouts and who we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">We came, as I showed it to the <span class="DLF">road</span> and we Started to check and in the same spread out wing, we ran through the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">It was not a big <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">We ran through the <span class="DLF">road</span> , away from the <span class="DLF">road</span> , inland, which it was like <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shrubs</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">And we turned, as I say, and I knew exactly the locations where it was going on by this particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">We had to turn a little bit forward ahead because we were getting to be closer to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where in that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , that little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="REGION">forest area</span> , they were making a big dig which I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And be that it is at night, I still was afraid who knows whether police or Germans, you know what I mean, may not be in the vicinity on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">So, everything was thought out by me and I outlined, I explained it to them, that's what it's going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">And after that, we have to cross another artery road which was leading into the Rachen and then with the <span class="DLF">fields</span> alongside that other <span class="DLF">road</span> , we would walk until it becomes <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="DLF">artery road</span> which was leading into the Rachen and then with the fields alongside that other road, we would walk until it becomes forest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">Forested area, from that point of view that we were from the city of the Rachen would be about maybe 10 kilometers, here you're talking about five miles; that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> <span class="REGION">Forested area</span> , from that point of view that we were from the city of the Rachen would be about maybe 10 kilometers, here you're talking about five miles; that forest would start. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">So it was a smaller <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest area</span> , where they used to have hay, you know, to cut hay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">And at certain times of the year, there used to be water, you know; it was not that you could sink in, but 1t used to be the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">That's why they used to, some of them, have to store their hay on elevated things for the farmers so in the winter they could come back with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleds</span> and get the hay for the feeding of their cattle and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">We did achieve that and I explained it to them: by good working through the night, we should achieve a target which it was called at that time, there was maleojaky (ph) and bulchenavitz (ph), the small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lakes</span> was called one settlement and the bigger <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lakes</span> was the other settlement. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">I knew that I had some Gentiles, farmers, over there that I dealt with, with the hope that may be they could help us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">I also did not mention over here that in the winter, I was working with a fishermen's crew while in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and this crew purposely was sent to bring fresh fish for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">So, while we were working on the ice over there and wherever we were sleeping, they were given <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> to sleep in, so I knew again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">So I tell them, I says, "Tonight, this was going to be for me to know that I'm on target. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">I'll have to hear that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">And, we'll have to go out to the <span class="DLF">road</span> to see because there's signs, certain signs on the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">So we planned in the little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> away from it, over there we will have to spend the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And that's what we were planning to be our march, which we were talking about give or take at that night to make no more than about 10 to 12 miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">Because, remember, we cannot march. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">We did not have our dinners and suppers and breakfasts before going, so we sort of gone, it was sort of carrying us, the will was doing it, not that physically we were built to be able to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">And as prescribed, we came to the same, I said the small <span class="DLF">pond</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">There were more than one <span class="DLF">pond</span> , so let's call it <span class="ENV_FEATURES">pond</span> instead of, you know, <span class="DLF">water ponds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">And now by that particular time that we got that far, we were already seeing that daylight was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">And with daylight coming, we were fearful; we were fearful of anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">We were fearful for the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , we were fearful for the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">So we decided to break and go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , find a <span class="NPIP">bushy place</span> and one would stay awake while the other three would be asleep and we would sort of maneuver around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">So it was all planned out well and that's how it was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">They realized in the morning, now, you will see the shepherds because the <span class="REGION">area</span> used to bring out the cattle for the grass feeding and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">And at night, evening time, they were taken back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">So since we didn't eat all night and the walking, so we decided to send Heinka, was the girl's name, Heinka, that I said she was a nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">Somehow or other, a female could camouflage their way more as a farm girl or farmhand than we, as men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And she was speaking good Polish or good Russian so we decided to send her out, to the closest <span class="DLF">chimney</span> , so out to the edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> and you could see the smoke coming through the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> , so that means, they were over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">So, we picked a singled out farmer, away from all the rest, and she went in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">She said to them that she is looking for work and she mentioned settlements quite in the <span class="REGION">area</span> where we were, going to hit; in other words, that she comes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warla</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">Warla was the name of, I don't know how to translate Warla, the meaning of it in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">But, you know, when a chicken, where the food comes in over there on the little part, that's a Warla, for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">You know what I'm saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">So, that's the pocket over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">So, that was a name, also there was a Big Warla and the Small Warla. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">So, she was saying that she comes from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">And why Warla? </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">That was poor farming over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">There was nothing but sands so the <span class="DLF">fields</span> were so bare they could only grow red potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">And the people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlements</span> used to come to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> to work to earn a living, or there was a place where they used to make turpentine and the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">So all of them used to, that was their means of making a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">So she pretended, because often people from that would be looking for farm work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And she came in to that woman, and told her that she was looking for work, and if they could use her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">And they told her, no, they can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">She says, "Do you mind sharing some food with me? </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">I don't have any." </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">And the woman asked her to sit down and eat but she did not want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">She says, "Give me some food." </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">And she brought, you know what I mean a piece of bread and everything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">Now, all four of us were sharing it and we decided to sort of sleep awake, awake and sleep; you know what I'm saying? </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">So we heard the shepherds coming nearby with their cattle and shepherds usually baked potatoes; that's the old time trick which shepherds would do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">They'd make them in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">fire</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">So we hoped that some potatoes is going to be left, which, again, if they cannot eat it, they're not taking them with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">You cannot re-bake it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">So, the same day after the shepherds left, we immediately went to follow these <span class="NPIP">places</span> to see and dig in and sure enough, we did find a few potatoes that were left over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">So there again, we had our food source for the day and that's what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And we decided to march again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">So, to give you the <span class="DLF">perimeter</span> , we would manage to be, assuming in our language, about two to five hundred yards away from the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">Therefore, you saw the telephone poles as it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">So he could go by that <span class="DLF">perimeter</span> because once you got into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , you forget where north and south and east and west is, you know what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">So, this sort of gave me like a compass-way, being in danger, when we heard any movement, either <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> or stuff like this here, we immediately retreated deeper into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> and stay on guard, which it happened through the course of the night, that you would see some traffic going through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">And our hope was, maybe we'd encounter partisans so we can surrender to them and beg them for help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">To make it a little bit shorter was, it took us three weeks until I finally stumbled on to one farmer -- and here I want to explain something as a note, footnote. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">After two weeks almost walking around and not achieving anything, that same Soneg Bornstein (ph), he used to be in large, before the war, a columnist writer to a Jewish/Polish paper, in large, that guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">He says, "Harold." </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">He says, "I think we are losing track. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">Look at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">It's two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">We haven't seen or heard one partisan." </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">So, I said to him, we used to call him Sonic (ph), at that time, like in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">I says, "Sonic, so what do you want me to do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">He says, "Why don't we take and make a vote whether we go forward or whether we go back." </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">I says, "You know, we were four of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">If all three of you want to go back, you are welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">I am not going back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">If I have to be killed, I'll be killed here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">I'll go to achieve my goal, what I set forth to you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">So, they looked sort of at each other and says, "Well, we'll go with you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">I says, "Let it be clear; I will not stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">I will not go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">I feel as bad as it is." </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">Until finally, one, a few, I mean because right away that it happened; it happened quite a few days afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And I'm already by distance into the bigger <span class="REGION">forest area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">And over there, they had more like colonists, you know, one <span class="DLF">farm</span> , maybe two, three <span class="DLF">farms</span> ; you know what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">But not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlement</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">And the settlement, the last one, was Slechy Podraberska (ph); again it's a name that's on the map, mapped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And in front of that settlement was the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Shars</span> <span class="RIVER">river Shars</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">And on that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> used to be, before the hostilities, it used to be a prom (ph) as we used to call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">A prom is like a passage way, you know, that they lead it, that it's built like on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barrels</span> like this here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">So they come and they cross the cattle or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> or whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">And at that time, later on, the partisans destroyed it by the way, because we did not want to make it easy on the Germans to be able, if they go to the police, to go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">We destroyed it and the Germans started to build a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> that they wanted and after they built the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , we needed it too, so we let the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">But that prom as we would call it, that passage way, we didn't like the idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">Not we, I mean, the partisans in general, the command decided that they were going to destroy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">So we come there and from distance I remember the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because I used to deal with them often. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">The father was with one leg, and he was, and so I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">And his son was a blonde guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">I recognized that I knew him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">As I come near, that dog is beginning to bark. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">And the dog was on a chain, running around the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">That dog just was tearing my heart out, he wouldn't stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">Before long, they're in back of me and I'm at the edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">All of a sudden, I see a guy coming out without his shirt on, in pants, and I take a look. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">He has tatoos on his hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">With tatoos on his hands, it leaves me to believe immediately that he is Russian because local people did not have tatoos on their hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">It wasn't, but the Russians, quite a number of them, especially a lot of them who used to serve in the Army or Navy for so many years and part of makeup, you find it a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">As I take a look and come closer, I see a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">It is in his pocket, hanging out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">I hope that you will believe me that when I tell you is exactly the way it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">I froze. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">He pulled out the gun and he told me to stop, halt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">I halted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">And I say to him, I mentioned the farmer's name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">I say, "I want to see him." </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And the son, after all of this here, seeing that the -- the guy's name 1s Misha Dubakof (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">He's a Soviet as I expected. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">I came out and I recognized him, calling him by name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">He said right now to the Soviet guy, or I will call him to the easterners, is an easterner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">He says, "Put, Misha," he says, "put your gun in your pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">That's a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">I know who he 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">Let me go ahead and talk with him." </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">So I un-froze, sort of and I start going and I come in to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">I shook hands with Misha first, and then with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">And he starts asking me, "What are you going here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">I says, "I'm looking to join the partisans." </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">I tell him the story already about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">He says, "Tell them they are safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">Let them come in here." </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">I start, they saw me and what had happened, they immediately run away further. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">Now I have a hard time with my yelling and talking, bringing them back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">And I keep talking to them in Yiddish, basically to understand that if I talk Yiddish, I'm safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">And I tell them, "We are all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">Please come out here, all of you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">And they finally come out and we all go into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">I get that man from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I hug him and tell him, you know what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">By that time, he asks me about my brother and this and that and the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">I says, "I cannot tell you anything." </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">I says, "You know, I just escaped from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">It's been three weeks that I've been away from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">Have you heard anything?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">He says, "No, nothing special had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">You usual." </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Because this gentle people used to keep, were the ones who would keep tabs on the partisans in the same way, and they knew what had happened in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">So, at this particular time, he introduces me back to Misha Dubakof (ph), as he's the partisan. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">I says, "I have one favor from you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">I did not mention it at first. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">On my car coat, I removed the star I used to wear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">At one time we were wearing round things, yellow, and at one time we were wearing the star. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">I did not remove that from the bottom, but I removed it from the top that it shouldn't be seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">Be for what it's worth, . </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">I says, "Misha, do me a favor and have the honors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">I want you to cut this identity of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">You know, as I use the word the shameful thing of recognition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">And I says, "From now on, I won't need it anymore." </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">I says, "I hope I can become a partisan." </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">We are served to eat right now and for the first time we are seeing food? </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">And the farmer keeps talking to us, "You can eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">Eat." </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">I says, "We've not had food in months and months so much, so we'll just eat a little bit." </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">And we thanked them, we did not know, crying, all of us, how to thank these people for what they did to us and he explained to us that a commander in charge of the local partisans will be here maybe in a few, not tonight, but maybe in a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And Misha Dubakof (ph) therefore, is taking charge of us and he is going to go ahead and keep us comfort and covered until the, the name of the commander was Zotsof (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">Zotsof 1s rabbit, from a, like Mr. Rabbit; you know what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">Zitz (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">Zitzaf (ph) was like a tartar, if you know what I'm saying about a tartar. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">You know, there is a nationality in Russian, the Tartars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">They are all short people and their skin is like with little holes and so on, not a smooth skin but like this here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">This man was a lieutenant in the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">He was left; he did not want to go to the prison of war camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">And now I must tell you how the partisans got started with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">Like Misha Dubokof (ph), like Zitsof, many decided that they did not want to fall into the hands of the Germans and they remained in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> with the retreating armies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">What they used to do, find farmers who needed help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">If maybe the son was drafted or killed or whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">So, they would cork for their keep, only for <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">By day, they would help him and if the Germans would come, or the police would come to the <span class="REGION">area</span> , they would be signaled by one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">They kept on a tab and they would escape to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> to hide themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">This is the way that the partisans really had started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">With the local people who had to run away because they were working with the former Communist government, and they knew that they must stay away, otherwise they would all be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">So in certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> , some of <span class="REGION">local area</span> turned in those people, to make good with the Germans; you follow me? </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">So, between the local left overs that were involved and between the retreating armies, those who didn't want to become prisoners of war, this is where they choose that life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">And later on, the Germans got hold of it because the Volasof's (ph) Army already was surrendering and they had all a new Army of Ukrainians who used to work for the Germans now and fill-in for whatever they need, in local or on the <span class="DLF">front line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">So the Germans permitted all the farmers who do need help, if they see a prisoner of war, because that's how they were able to get hold of the prisoners that were in hiding, that all they have to do is register them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">Once they're registered them, they can keep them as working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">A lot of them did register and then they went on the <span class="REGION">Germans side</span> , joined the police force or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">Others were really killed; you know what I mean, by the Germans or sending them back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">But, I'm talking about those who succeeded in their mission to stay out, becoming POWs or working with the farmers and that's how the partisans started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">At that particular time, the partisans, I want to tell how the rest of it a little bit later, but I want to tell about us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">We had to wait a couple of nights until Zitsof (ph), as I'll use the name, Zitsof, which he was the commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">And like I say, he still had the ammunition, leather jacket, and everything that he was wearing at the time when they retreated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">And he was a very nervous kind of guy, heavy smoker and drinker, just as much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">But he was a skillful shooter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">He could go ahead and 1, 2, 3, you know what I mean, and aim target and have it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">And I had the pleasure of meeting him at that time and all of us, so he came in and one by one, we went for interviews with Zitsof. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">And I told him that I was sort of the leader of the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">I helped them out, told him about myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">He says, "Tell me, what you're doing is good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">But, what do you think we have <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> here with weapons? </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">I know you want to join. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">We'll take you in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">Where are we going to get weapons for you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">I says, "Where do you get weapons for the others? </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">Tell me and I'll get them." "</span><span class="sentence" id="1273">Well, you've got to go kill a policeman or German." </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">I says, "We are already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">Whenever you go to, that you are going to do these kind of ways, to set up an ambush, we volunteer." </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">He says, "Okay." </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">He okayed us, all four and we had a good few drinks with him together to prove it, our loyalty and everything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">And the day afterwards, we were taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">semi-camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">What was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">A <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wooded</span> area deep over there with big palm <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wooded area</span> deep over there with big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">palm trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">We used to spread out, you know what I mean, something underneath what they used to cover the horses with and that was your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">You did not have no pillows. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">Your rifle was between your legs and that's how you were, you know, until you were, they used to have an Army, sort of, <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> set up with a fork of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> made, and buckets and that used to cook whatever we could get, you know what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">Because we would have to go to farmers and wait for and ask, but this time we used to go with weapons and ask for food and we would get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">So, we had the first taste that we joined. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">The second news was that we were going to have a ambush in the next few days and all of us would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">I was elected to climb up on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> and be the observer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">So I was given field glasses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">All the other ones, there was a group altogether of about ten partisans and they heard the news that Germans and the police and Fritz, which I had mentioned his name before, who was the head of the Gestapo at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">On this particular ambush, we, all right, Fritz remain wounded but he, they took him back, you know what I mean to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> , but this is to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen ghetto</span> at that particular time aware of partisans that was over there, but it didn't do much good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">There was no organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">So we went on that ambush and succeeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">And I ran to get, the first thing I got was a pistol and I got a gun from somebody else, I mean a rifle from somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">And before long, as you know, all of us had weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">So, at least, but my job on the top of that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> was to signal to somebody at the bottom of how far and how many. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">The policemen were riding on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> and Fritz was at that time on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> driving; that's how he used to drive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">You know, he had, sitting like a king. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">You know what I mean, driving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">And there was a contingent of maybe 10 or 12, you know, call it, you know, that they wore over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">And what do you think they used to do, come to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> <span class="FOREST">forests</span> either to go ahead, take certain things that they wanted, food for themselves, you know, like ham and the other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">The farmers always had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">Or if not, they went to go to come to the farmers to have a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">That's where they used to come in the <span class="BUILDING">junkets</span> like this here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">We attacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">They started to retreat, but one of them got killed right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">The other one injured, which we killed him anyways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">And Fritz escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">So this was my first participation as a partisan and I felt myself right now ten feet tall. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">Here I got a pistol, got a rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">Later the pistol I gave away to Zotsof. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">He didn't want it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">They didn't let you have a pistol right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">So I had a rifle and I was full of joy, full of hope that now I'm doing something worthwhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">Now the story of the fights and the partisans 1s a big story to tell which it would take. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">I wish you would tell me how much further you want me to detail on it, or to go a little bit more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">So, you tell me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1317">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">Let's change the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">End of Tape #5 Tape #6</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Had you ever had any experience using weapons, or using a gun before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1320">ANSWER:  Until I reached the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , I never experienced using a weapon in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">And after the ambush, when I got that rifle, I asked later to be instructed of the usage of the rifle, and which I was shown how to clean it and how to use it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">And I still remember vividly the first ttme when I fired the first shot, which it was 1n the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">But, holding the rifle the way I was instructed to hold, it gave me a bounce that I fell on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">And the instructor at that time told me, "That's all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">Don't get scared about it." </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">But, you will learn that you, I held it too strong to my body instead of a little bit aiming it and having the touch and feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">So, that was really my first experience that day, in my life, where I went away to use a Weapon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1328">QUESTION:  Was there any personal conflict with the concept of using a gun and killing someone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1329">ANSWER:  In what way do you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1330">QUESTION:  Well, I'm sure you weren't brought up to shoot?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1331">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">The concept at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> before the war was that killing was not a Jewish way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">The Jewish people did not hold guns, you know what I mean, like this here, like, in other words like joining, like a lot of people join the rifle club or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">In the Hasidic way of life, you could never encounter that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">I believed the news breaking about a Hasidic person holding a gun, that change came in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and it only came after World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">It only came after the Holocaust when finally, the people who cherished a religion became understanding that you must learn the art of weaponry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">Because basically, historic the Jews were warriors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">They had warriors or they could never have Samson, they can never have King David and they can never could have all the era of history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">But, the Diaspora (ph) was a different element what Jews lived in and weaponry was not the form for them to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">They were afraid, they were guests in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and they felt like it, that therefore they should not antagonize by it because the only kind known to me when Jews were practicing weaponry was in Europe, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before the war, who belonged to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Batar</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">But my family had no dealings with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Batar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">My upbringing, I am a Batar person these days but I only switched, I only changed after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">But in those years, I was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">So therefore on the <span class="REGION">Jewish scene</span> , with the exception, not 100 percent, with the exception, weaponry or rifle clubs was not a Jewish life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">And it was not part of the Jewish way of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1346">QUESTION:  So, it was very clear to you at this time that this was the way you were going to proceed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1347">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">And this is why the change in my life came later, just because of that perhaps, I say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">And that's where the change came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1350">QUESTION:  After this ambush, what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">Why don't you continue?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1352">ANSWER:  Well, after the ambush, now, we were in that camp, trying to join the rest and just to bring to understanding an average day of life in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> trying to join the rest and just to bring to understanding an average day of life in the underground, what did it start? </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">The underground was living in at that era of time, in bushy parts of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">They used to see separately a company; in other words, you couldn't come into an <span class="REGION">area</span> and you found a thousand partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">Perhaps to find a thousand partisans, which they were in the local, was probably in ten different <span class="INT_SPACE">spaces</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">So we used to be living like in companies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">A company could consist of a maximum of 100, maybe not so close. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">And then it had so many platoons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">At times used to have two platoons, at times we used to have three platoons, depending on the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">And, I must mention here the commander's name; whatever his private name was, was the name of the company; like for instance, Zitsof (ph), which I joined with, the name of that company was Zitsof. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">There was also Blatoz (ph), there was Fadyakomorov (ph), there were Lanskytrak (ph); there were a variety of more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">And all of that goes, didn't change until about 1943 when we used to be when we started getting para troopers who used to be dropped at a bigger force of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naliboky</span> (ph) and then they used to make day away to our <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> <span class="FOREST">forests</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">When the partisans were organized under the direct command of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1364">QUESTION:  What was your <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> 's name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1365">ANSWER:  Leipachani (ph) forest is where I am dwelling at this time in the <span class="REGION">area</span> that we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">And I geographical area would be between one <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> named <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Chara</span> <span class="RIVER">Chara</span> (ph) and another <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> named <span class="COUNTRY">Yemen</span> (ph) and <span class="COUNTRY">Yemen</span> was the big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> <span class="REGION">geographical area</span> would be between one river named Chara (ph) and another river named Yemen (ph) and Yemen was the big river. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">And literally located, it was between the vicinity of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slomun</span> (ph), between the vicinity of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novogrudate</span> (ph), and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Lida</span> <span class="RIVER">Lida</span> (ph) and that was the perimeter in which we were located, which on the map it would be found. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">Now, this is the way we started; as time went on, it diversified, 1t became bigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">When the Germans would attack us, at times when we became too powerful, we again would have to breakup in smaller groups, operating in various <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">The brigade used to assign areas of where which way we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">Now, the other <span class="NPIP">part</span> , how did they achieve all of that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">They used to have like a parole or consult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">Every time, every night, or rather, every day for 24 hours, he used to be a parole name, maybe tonight, today, the next, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">So, the partisans would meet with partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">The base at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> , we knew that they were also partisans because we operated at night and you couldn't, a lot of times see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1376">QUESTION:  Who gave you that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1377">ANSWER:  Well, the staff which it was the general staff and the local area staff used to decide on all of these here things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">At first, when we were groups by itself, like Zitzof (ph) groups and the other, I remember we used to do it by whistles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">And I would, we used to do three whistles as a response, two whistles as a question, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">So it went on from time to time more modern it came when we were more organized, when the content was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">When each company used to have a radio man, the whole tune and everything else changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">But that didn't take place until about mid 1943 when we were equipped with our radio man and immediately we could have the direct contact with the staff, let's say, from the brigade or the brigade could get immediately in touch with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">For instance, at one time through 1943, when the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> began turning the other way, that the Germans were starting on the retreat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">Stalin gave an order and he talk about the partisans, but the greatest help to the war was through the partisans because we kept the Germans busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">The more Germans we kept detained in garrisons towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , the more we kept for them towards the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> because they couldn't depend on the local themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">The last man power, they were able to send to the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">The more <span class="DLF">mines</span> we used to explode to stop, even if it meant stopping the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , going in a certain direction to the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> for one day, one day's supplies means a big deal to the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">So it came up on order at one time which it was coded "rail". </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">That was the code name, "rail". </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">On this night there was a direct order from Stalin that under all circumstances, wherever this is a partisan between the Soviet Union to the farthest <span class="DLF">line</span> of the front or behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">On this night, every partisan must contribute to destroy as part of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">In many <span class="REGION">areas</span> we were sending in small groups to make the damage bigger and in other <span class="REGION">areas</span> , 1t was an order that we had to fight our way because the Germans began already to watch the <span class="DLF">railroads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">Which again, and in the meanwhile, we gave them additional people to use for watching the <span class="DLF">railroads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">So they started instilling a system which it was like electrical wire but it was not the wire electrically, it was like through bells. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">Then we would come to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , we would stumble on something and that would sound off a sound. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">So at times we would not even know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">At another times, they would go ahead and put <span class="DLF">mines</span> alongside for the infantry mines so once we would come to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , therefore we could be killed or that would send off a signal and save a <span class="DLF">mine</span> <span class="DLF">infantry mines</span> so once we would come to the railroad, therefore we could be killed or that would send off a signal and save a mine from coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">They had to include the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotives</span> to detect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">So we involved in one way or the other much grief and problems for the Germans through that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">So Stalin gave therefore that order that the rails on this night and on that night, that's why it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">We, through power of attack, which were otherwise, everyone of us was given a piece, it looked like a white piece, they used to call it in Russian, "towel (ph)" , that's the plastic explosives as we call them of today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">It was an oblong piece like a piece; it had one piece like to put in the capsule and these capsules were various. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">They were capsules where you could go ahead to detonate them, it would draw a <span class="DLF">line</span> from a distance so much away and as you pulled it, it triggered it off and you would explode it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">Other times we used more; we used to make this together in bigger amounts and put them out underneath there and wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">We used to do it in <span class="NPIP">places</span> where it curves, on a big curve. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">And on a big curve, everybody knows the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> slows down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">So before it goes into the curve, once past the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> , we always wanted to hit the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> when we used to make an explosion because if the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> explodes, no matter how much damage you didn't do to the rest, but this here causes so many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> passing that to de-rail. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">So it was all strategy involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">They used to sometimes put in a wire into the ring and that wire we used to put right near the rail so as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> would travel, it would trigger either by weight or it would trigger to touch, this here part of the wire, and the explosion would occur. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">We used to retreat to quite a distance, so, but the distance far enough that we would hear it, sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">On other occasions, it happened, your <span class="DLF">mine</span> did not explode because it was a faulty capsule. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">We did not have the equipment all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">So before we had this fancy explosives, because when we were in touch with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> , they dropped by <span class="DLF">air</span> all of this kind of things in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> and it used to be distributed to the other partisan organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">Before that, what we used to do, so many, as I aforementioned, the soldiers who knew ammunition and every company has at least a few guys who knew ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">They used to take, for instance, the shells from the artillery shells. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">The artillery shells basically melt them out into a box or square or whatever it is and we would now how much explosives, put in just one of these here capsules to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , wire it, and you take this here and that served as an explosive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">At times, while the capsule was there, in the artillery shell, we would mend it to be able to form, to make a capsule. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">There were specialists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">I, only have seen it, worked with it, I couldn't tell you, I can only tell you of one incident that one time that we were on the rail and we were on a very special mission, as Poles, sort of, going and on the way when we reached our mission and we turned back to go way, as partisans, and we had to demolish a few <span class="DLF">bridges</span> and <span class="DLF">lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">And at one <span class="NPIP">place</span> near the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , I was wearing a long coat and all of us had enough to drink before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">And I remember seeing that wire almost, if that wire had been a little bit more touching it, we all would have gone to <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">But again, drinking was a part of the insecurity that one lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">So, in the partisans, it used to be a slogan, vethum (ph) "let's have a drink". </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">Swabota (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">Now there is glory, today there is victory, so we got to take a drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">Then we had another way that we were sad because we had, we suffered losses, we were ambushed or whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">So, of course you have to, so one way or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">Moonshine, we did not have regular vodka, moonshine was part of the diet that I would say 99 percent of the partisans used to be involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">And you couldn't help it, you lived at a time that the next minute, you could be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">You were not responsible for yourself, so that was part of the irresponsible that it was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">However, I think the Russian Army still is involved in a lot of drinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">I don't say that the American Army isn't, but I'm sure it's more visible as the way the Russians were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1433">QUESTION:  You're talking about drinking and getting drunk, or drinking?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1434">ANSWER:  That's the true answer, both ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">One time, you drink for everything, celebrating, and you drink so much that you got drunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">On the other hand, you came into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that you became drunk by not being able to handle that, you know what I'm saying? .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1437">QUESTION:  Did the drinking help seal the comraderie between the Jewish and the Soviet soldiers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1438">ANSWER:  Well, the comraderie or vice versa was no contribution to the drinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">It was basically, we must understand that these people had lived in a poisonous area before they came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">The poison that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or the anyway Nazis did through all kinds of propaganda, somehow or the other penetrated to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">And a lot of time, it was a cause why so many joined to become anti-Semites was not directly but it was just, became a part at first like in a joking way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">For instance, I remember when we got the paratroopers to us and at one time jokes started to penetrate and go around about Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">And the first time I ever heard the expression with the long "r" instead of abram (ph), you know, the different way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">Because a lot of Jewish people pronounced it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">And like one of the jokes, for instance, we were telling was, if fight, let us fight, but send me on the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">This is only to tell you that they existed and though existed in a more way than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">And the biggest problem was, when we knew that this were, that the paratroopers came and trained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">This is why it would irritate one to realize that the poison was not planted down here, but the poison was already planted in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> or other there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">We did not know at the time of the atrocities that Stalin did and the killing of Jewish people, that it went on at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">We didn't, this type of communications we didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">But we did know that many in the rank, of high rank, Captain Lavida (ph), for instance, in our <span class="REGION">area</span> , in our <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , and he had, he's, the man was sent down for one thing, political. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">He started printing a paper and that paper was distributed in the <span class="REGION">local area</span> and so was it distributed to the partisans at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">As I mentioned, the politicalization of the Russians began to come back to us in the year of 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">And we had to listen to a little bit more coaching and teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">While we were at war, and we were not there, but we still, they had to bring us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">So all these changes, changing of the name, changing in command, different things, while some of them were positive, there was a lot of negative. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">And at that particular time, one could not go ahead sort of, in a way, feel out as we were so mistreated by the outside world and so many anti-Semites were around, that it was sort of small wonder, that somebody else is joining the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">As it looked like, the whole world was against us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">And that's the feeling that we all had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">So, it used to be at times, when we were done, meaning the partisans in general, the Jews would not be all to themselves because basically, when they came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , a lot of the Jews came in a group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">For instance, in our <span class="REGION">area</span> , we had Dr. Atlas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">In our <span class="REGION">area</span> we also had the Alonzos (ph) which comes from my wife's <span class="REGION">area</span> , you know, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jetel</span> (ph) or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jachoviz</span> (ph), whichever way you want to call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">There were groups, 100 percent Jews that they escaped the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the massacre and they came then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">So the commander, for instance, like Dr. Atlas was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">And he was the one who was practicing doctor, but the man went to battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">And he gave his life in battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">But his group was called the Dr. Atlas group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">Later after he passes on, this group changes its name and we get an escapee from the POWs by the name of Sherbin (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">Sherbin was a very beautiful commander, at that time when he took it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">But, after he took it over, they did not let it be anymore the whole 100 percent Jewish, they incorporated other partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">So the change went on like integration. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">Yes and no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">When the times were good, they didn't want to separate Jewish groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">When the times were bad, so even the Abramofs (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">You know, it was at one time the commander at that time was Abramof. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">In Abramof's group, there were 80 percent Jews and 20 percent non-Jews, and the mistreatment was clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">In other words, what kind of a word was sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">And, you know, when, in these kind of cases, he was not Jewish, Abramof, you know; or even if he was, he was not telling about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">And anti-Semitism was a clear venture to see in the everyday affair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">And I want, for instance, right now to dwell one day life as a partisan. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">We used to have a wake up time, but now with the Army, somebody was blowing the coronet or whatever it is, but 1t used to be a wake up time that we had to get up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">And then we used to have to get up and there was a briefing time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">That took place already where we were under the direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">The company was called to order. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">The commander was coming out and tell the details for the day, whatever we had, each company has to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">Maybe this one is going for an ambush, the other one is going for provisions, the other one is going someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">So, you were called to order and after that, you had breakfast. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">Our breakfast was, in that part of the world, you don't have a breakfast like in the <span class="COUNTRY">USA</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">The breakfast could have consisted of good meats or something, maybe pasta mixed into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">It was a soup and meat combination, one way or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">And it was on a, built like a bonfire and in the middle of it a bucket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">And, so, if you had at times a Ukrainian being the chef or sort of, the cook, we ate a lot of Ukrainian-style meals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">And if we had that it wasn't a Ukrainian, so we had another style. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">But the same thing that I'm bringing out, after you had your bite, then you had, there was an order everyday, cleaning the weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">And it was not easy to keep the weapons clean as you would, you know, as if you would be outside of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">You had to go ahead at times, your platoon commander would have to go ahead and check whether the weapons were cleaned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">Then, you used to sometimes go ahead, you had recruits or whatever it is that just came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">We did not know how to handle <span class="DLF">mines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">I remember taking my platoon at one time to a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">When you detonate a hand grenade into a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> , there is no sound. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">So we used to go ahead and teach them how you pull out the button and you hold on with your hands and throw it, because we used to have a German hand grenades; used to be with a handle, the Russians were without a handling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">They were like an egg with little schrapnels in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">And we would go ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">And then we had fish afterwards, because from the explosion of that, the fish come up, surface at the top, you know what I'm saying? </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">So, we couldn't go ahead, for instance, to train a machine gunner how to shoot, you know what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">Only by explaining it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">Because it would have been, first of all, a waste of bullets which you could not afford to waste and second, it would be a give-away of the <span class="NPIP">location</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">So, there were a lot of things under consideration. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">But, yes, the guards; every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that we set up used to have certain guard posts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">And the platoon commander used to have to assign from his platoon who goes where. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">Then there was choice for the platoon commanders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">Everyday was the man of the day; in other words, he was the commander of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">So, he could have been only a platoon commander but today you were in command. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">So, actually, if we had to go fighting, you were instructing until the commander, the regular commander, would take over and you would go into battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">So, the assignments were a regular routine, almost like Army life and we had to participate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">So, cleaning of the weapons; now, the attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">A lot of weapons, as we are talking now from between '42 and '43, the retreating armies left a lot weapons behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">Some of the farmers took and hide some of the weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">We had trained enough Russian soldiers who were able to rebuilt weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">So, from three rifles, maybe we only rebuilt one because you couldn't, you needed a certain <span class="NPIP">part</span> here and another <span class="NPIP">part</span> there and they would skillfully do it together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">We would clean the bullets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">We did not have any other means but sand, but we'd sand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">They would have to clean and polish so we would have bullets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">A lot of it was retrieved from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> because while retreating, they put a lot in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> instead of leaving it for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">We pulled out of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pancer</span> (ph), <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Pancer truck</span> , from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Shar</span> <span class="RIVER">river Shar</span> , and my commander at that time, Pechulud (ph) which it was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">And he and other crew refurbished and rebuilt it from another one; from two of this year or maybe more of them, wound up to make the motor work and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">And we used it at one time, on two occasions into battle, when we had to attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">So, the same thing achieved to build up a Howitzer (ph), 122 millimeter, you know, where the sacks of the gun powder comes separately from the shell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">And again, we had to retrieve these here things from what we found. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">The Germans had the farmers or the <span class="REGION">local area</span> retrieve all the weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">At that time, they used to purposely clean it and at times, while their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> would keep up these weapons, we would ambush and maybe take it from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">It was a life of dog eat dog everyday, about obtaining. </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">In those years I'm talking with polishing the weapons and re-building, did not have command posts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">We did not have no orders from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> and to get ammunition was the only way to get it from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">So we used to attack a <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> , for instance, we were able to, we attacked it basically to obtain weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">We knew they were going to come back, but we got so many rifles, so many machine guns, so much of the bullets, and everything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">So, that's what the attack on the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> served for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">Now, another daily routine which it was, where we used to be sent out in various <span class="NPIP">places</span> , to cut telephone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">Military phones, you know, in those years, you couldn't have the walkie-talkies as we know today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">So, a telephone had to have telephone wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">And the connection between one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">outpost</span> to the other with wires. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">And we literally would have to have groups of guys because to cut telephones, there would be enough to send a group of two, three guys; one at that stay watch and two to do the work, cutting 1t down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">We used to sometimes utilize civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">We would come into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , take some civilians, make them be the laborers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">So the three guys, they went away and got three more farmers so each one of us could do certain jobs that much faster. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">Some of the farmers did it out of cooperation with us; some of the farmers did it under the gun; we made them do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">But, this was a regular routine of cutting telephones, at times burning <span class="DLF">bridges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">The <span class="DLF">bridges</span> leading to the forested area, we always wanted it not to be around, because we did not want to have it easy on the Germans to come in with their Penser (ph) <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> or to come in with their light tanks, or whatever it 1s to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forested area</span> <span class="REGION">forested area</span> , we always wanted it not to be around, because we did not want to have it easy on the Germans to come in with their Penser (ph) trucks or to come in with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">light tanks</span> , or whatever it 1s to go to the forest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">So at times they would go ahead and lay a pentun (ph) or something and come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">But all of this here were efforts that gave us more time either to organize, either to retreat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">If we knew that a big Army was coming, it was no use to set up battle against them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">But, to send up explosive areas, to do damage, to make them believe that who knows 1s behind or to have a big armies to go, that's what we achieved to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">And if I was to say to you and tell you, battle by battle, I have that recorded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">But, 1t would take me too much to name you the way it was organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">I can tell you one battle in particular points which it was, which is of trying to tell you because we had girls and boys as well in our fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">And I'm talking about, not that I'm trying to change the subject; I'm talking about Jewish girls and boys who were not skilled in being shooters or killers, but they had to turn to the savagery of the times because that was the only way for us to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">One, for instance, that I left behind after I escaped, Rusha Batskin (ph) was her name, and we were, she was in part of what I said to begin with, Dr. Atlas group, and later under Shuben (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">She was Shuben's girlfriend, for instance; even love went on in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> and babies were born in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , or they were killed, and abortions were going on in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">We had a <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> , sort of for a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">It was very well sealed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">The Germans in our <span class="REGION">area</span> never got to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ; now, that's how it was sealed through little walk-ways to go in, in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> were they couldn't come, they couldn't come over it with heavy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> <span class="DLF">walk-ways</span> to go in, in a place were they couldn't come, they couldn't come over it with heavy trucks or anything like this here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">So, we were organized at that time knowing that the Germans are trying to come to the <span class="REGION">area</span> to collect wheat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">All the farmers -- do we have enough time to go on? .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1564">QUESTION:  We have another minute or so left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1565">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">The Germans used to give to the farmers like tax, that they need from them so much wheat, so much butter, so much chickens, so much livestock and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">Each time, the news would be spread around to the farmers, we would get hold of the news and set up ambushes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">So, to give you an example, if we were to set up an ambush on them, and we wouldn't touch them while going to collect it, but after they made their collection, the farmers were to distribute it in this and that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">Then they would re-load it and start taking it to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">So beforehand, the farmers used to bring it to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">When the partisans became organized, no longer would we permit them to take it to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">So, either we would get it from the farmer and give him a receipt, or we would make an ambush and when the halting is organized, kill all the Germans or the police, and then turn around, with all of these horses and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggies</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> with whatever it is; livestock, if not livestock, it was wheat or oats, turn them around, bring them in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forested areas</span> <span class="REGION">forested areas</span> to the poor farmers because the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forested areas</span> <span class="REGION">forested areas</span> , farmers were not well-to-do farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">But they allowed us to be there and give it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">It was taken from the rich to give it to the poor, as it said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">But in our case it was taking it from the Germans and giving it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">End of Tape #6 Tape #7</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1577">ANSWER:  Well, this is why I made my business to go ahead and write that manuscript some 35 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">Believe me, it was the wrong time that I did it, because when I did it with my English of today, it would have been published probably ten times over and would have a movie done because all these fights and going on, you know, you've seen probably partisan movies, maybe like it went on in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> with Marshall Tito. </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">He was the chief. .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1580">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">Hold on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1582">ANSWER:  Due to the fact that the Germans were supposed to collect that contribution from the farmers of wheat, when it came to our command's knowledge, we set up an <span class="DLF">ambush</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">We were trying to ambush the Germans at that particular time before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">While other ambushes were done after they would have already the collection made, this time we wanted to set them up that they should come and we wanted to really show them that we are a power in this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">On that <span class="DLF">road</span> leading to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , between the city of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> and another little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rudayaverska</span> (ph), since it was, that <span class="REGION">area</span> was Lipichani (ph) forest, were three, before you came to that river Shara (ph), there were three little <span class="DLF">bridges</span> <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Shara</span> (ph), there were three little bridges on our perimeter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">The little <span class="DLF">bridges</span> were served from the farmers as drains from the <span class="DLF">fields</span> of the water to go into the <span class="DLF">canals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">So they were of use to the farmers and that's why they were built, was drainage of the <span class="DLF">canal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1588">We decided that we were going to use explosives on it and burn them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">So, the first <span class="DLF">bridge</span> we decided which it was closer to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rachen</span> <span class="RIVER">Rachen</span> , that that <span class="DLF">bridge</span> we will explode the first. </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">So, since our <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> by way of espionage, found out and they had onlookers from the distance seeing what is coming 1n, so they were no Penser (ph) <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , there were no Pensers or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">It was just that they were on horses and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , which it was carrying the police and the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">So, we decided at that particular time to let a certain amount, since the police used to always be in the front; the Germans used to not be in the front, but the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">So, the police we let through first to come in there and then we decided to blow the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">When the explosion of the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> was, was one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> got caught in the delay and it blew up because of the gasoline and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">Immediately they descended into both sides of the <span class="DLF">road</span> , starting to shoot on each <span class="NPIP">side</span> and we saw their <span class="NPIP">positions</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">So once they started to shoot clear and they got up, we immediately started to shoot against them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">So, then they were in total confusion, because on this side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> was shooting to them and on this <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">But the way we were placed in such a position that we should not, our fire shouldn't be shot against each other on the other side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1599">But in this particular time, the way the Germans laid themselves out, it was almost sort of the way it was meant to be, that our fire would go against them and not against our own across. </span><span class="sentence" id="1600">So when we started shooting, when we started firing, all of a sudden, hands went up to the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="1601">Those big heroes, the Germans, as well as the police, no longer were tough guys and they started to plead and beg. </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">Ammunition on the side was collected and we started lining up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1603">Among the Germans over there, there were the Desunden Freur (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1604">On our side of the <span class="DLF">perimeter</span> , I was at that time a machine gunner and I had a Russian type of machine gun with a round disc on the top and I was placed from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> were to attack and where to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">And before long I found out that we had a casualty of someone that I knew close, which was a girl, tall girl and a brave girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1606">She always used to go to battle whenever her brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1607">She was with three brothers together and one of them used to be a machine gunner, used to, Anamoxinkas (ph), we used to call him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1608">Anamoxinkas is a water-cooled machine gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="1609">And her other brother, which it was the oldest one, became at that particular time the commander of the platoon, of the former Dr. Atlas's group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1610">And she was the casualty of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1611">She was shot from this, when I said the Germans started to shoot on this <span class="NPIP">side</span> , so she was a casualty and we just found it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1612">As I go on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> to clear, to look for Germans or police who were either wounded or whatever it 1s, I come and near me I see another girl from the Rachen, which she was also with us all the time, Rasha Baskin (ph) is her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1613">I don't know her whereabouts today, because when I escaped the Soviet Union, she was, she remained behind and I have no contact with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1614">But, she spotted, she says, "Look, Harold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1615">Look, Harold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1616">Here's the Zundenfuer (ph)." . </span><span class="sentence" id="1617">The Zundenfuer means that he was the head of the <span class="REGION">region</span> from the Gestapo, and he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1618">And as we approached him, I approached him now with the machine gun, she had at that time a rifle only in her hand, and he says to her, "Don't." </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">And he starts pleading we shouldn't kill him, whereupon he pulls out a pocket from his pocket, photographs of the Rachen girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1620">Whatever this man, either he was in love with them or had love affairs with them or what, we at that time did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1621">And neither did I want to listen, so I wanted to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1622">She starts pleading with me, "Harold he is mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1623">You're not going to kill him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">I am." </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">And she basically, with the rifle went and smashed his head to pieces, because after seeing the pictures of these girls, we know any SS guy or Gestapo who has pictures from girls which they used to do at practice, have sex with them, then taking pictures with them yet, understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1626">All of them, you know what I mean, to put into sort of their collections. </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">Now, at one time, I must say, that I had to give a good reason and a good thanks to Rasha Baskin for killing a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">And it was beyond my personal belief, in a way, but in battle you see the enemy and you don't see anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">And that's what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">And we moved on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">Of course, she says she's going to take his gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="1632">I let her take his gun because trophies; there was plenty of ammunition for everyone to pick up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1633">By that time, I had a German luger at that time that I took and I wanted to carry it, but at that time I turned it in to the command because what would I do for getting bullets for a German luger? </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">It was easy for us to get bullets from Russian-type guns than to get for Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">We used to get enough ammunition of theirs, but that was hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1636">Now, after the first battle line was over, our command ordered us to go back to <span class="NPIP">position</span> <span class="DLF">battle line</span> was over, our command ordered us to go back to position, only changing position because we expected that this will not be the last battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">So all of these killed, including the Zundenfeur (ph), the officer, our command ordered to go ahead, to strip their uniforms off of them and just naked and covering with a blanket, put them back on a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and we took one of the farmers, send them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to turn in their corpses and give them a note, "Don't fight us, because that's the way you're going to see the rest of you come back." </span><span class="sentence" id="1638">It's true enough that we were there and the following day the commander decided that we should be on guard again because they probably will send in a second force. </span><span class="sentence" id="1639">And they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1640">On the second force what they sent, that's why I could understand why they went to burn up the last <span class="DLF">bridge</span> to us, but the first <span class="DLF">bridge</span> to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1641">And the other two, we mined at this time, one at a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1642">They came with a light <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> at this time and they came, again, Germans and they had the police which they were a makeup of Ukrainians and the other Russians and they started to do the same thing and we again let them cross that second <span class="DLF">bridge</span> before the explosion was made. </span><span class="sentence" id="1643">The explosion got at this time, caught that small task that they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1644">And it was done, you know, they couldn't have maneuvered; they would have to have heavy equipment to pull it out, which they came days afterwards to try to pull it out because of fear that the partisans may go ahead right now and re-build it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1645">You know what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="1646">They got espionage the same way as we did, to know what we were up to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1647">And again that was <span class="DLF">battle line</span> number two. </span><span class="sentence" id="1648">We were still waiting and a couple of days later they sent a bigger force again and again at this time, we ensued battle and realizing the roar of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> that 1t came a big force. </span><span class="sentence" id="1649">Our command decided to retreat and we retreated to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1650">Then they came in with a bigger force to the farmers at that time for the contingent what they had to get from them of the wheat, but at this time we could not control it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1651">But the mere fact was that in order for them to collect the taxed wheat or provisions from the farmers, no longer could be gotten from these <span class="REGION">areas</span> without a fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1652">So we achieved our purpose that we made this fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1653">Before long a change in all of that had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1654">The Germans decided to build, as they called, a self-defense team. </span><span class="sentence" id="1655">And in each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlement</span> , they were ordered to join on doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">They used to hang up a piece of rail or a bell and as soon as partisans would show in that vicinity, the bell or the rail piece would start making noise on the ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">It would carry from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlement</span> to the other, until it would come to the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1658">Then the police would have to come out, put some on ambush or come searching to catch the partisans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1659">QUESTION:  Who did this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1660">The local people did it for the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1661">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1662">They did it for the Germans to alert them that partisans are out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1663">And in the meanwhile, they would send a force against us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1664">On three occasions, luck was with me, that I was struck on this type of ambushes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1665">And either my number wasn't up or my alertness was good, that I was able to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , because we used to use <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> to come there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1666">And I shoved myself up, turned over on my belly, into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> and three days later I showed up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , on each of these occasions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">I don't mean on that particular day; on each of these occasions, when I came, I was looked upon like I returned from death because they already had given up on me, because a number of us used to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1668">And the command decided that no longer could that be tolerated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1669">Otherwise, we would have to leave the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">And leaving the <span class="REGION">area</span> was not saying we'll move on elsewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1671">The elsewhere, if 1t works, it will work elsewhere the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1672">Our command decided on teaching a lesson and we had to do it the German way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1673">We took a farm area, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlement</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lansovicha</span> <span class="DLF">farm area</span> , the settlement was called Lansovicha (ph) and we surrounded it one morning with our troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="1674">There were a few hundred people in participation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1675">And the first thing, we waited for somebody to come and hitting the bell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1676">Somebody did come and as soon as he hit the bell, machine gun was fired and that man was dead and more people who started to run out of their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1677">They realized the casualties and all of them began all of a sudden to be alert. </span><span class="sentence" id="1678">We started a fire because their <span class="DLF">roofs</span> were made out of straw and we had the special bullets, fire bullets, to start fire, on purposely to make a little panic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1679">While a certain group of ours were taking charge of the livestock, everybody tried to drive their livestock out because they were afraid it will burn up, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1680">So, while they were, the farmers were driving out, our people were taking over, lining them up and they were driven to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> while our command decided to share this cattle among the poor farmers in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1681">That was left to be a lesson that any settlement that will cooperate with the Germans and will alert our moves, whatever partisans in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , can expect the same treatment as Lansovich (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1682">And that, after that, they didn't remove it, from there on, after that time that 1t happened, the farmers in the <span class="REGION">area</span> understood that either, if you listen and do for the Germans, you'll get killed from the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1683">And if you listen the other way, you'll get killed from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1684">So, therefore, they tried to play a little bit of a different game. </span><span class="sentence" id="1685">And it no longer was the success as the Germans anticipated it would. </span><span class="sentence" id="1686">The reason that Peklansavichy (ph) was because from that settlement, there were a number of guys serving in the police force in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1687">And we had our contact man who our command could get all information needed, because we also had local people who were working on our side and they were actually against the Germans and what they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1688">But, it had to be done in a hiding kind of way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1689">The story, after that what had happened with that battle, changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1690">And really, here, at one time, we made almost like calling a massacre because quite a number of casualties. </span><span class="sentence" id="1691">The farmers would go out and start pleading, "Don't burn, don't burn up my <span class="DLF">farm</span> ," and this and that and the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1692">And we knew the families that were there; the families of those policemen serving in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> were all killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1693">So, be that you want to call it savagery for the sake of liberation, but we had to bring it down, that's what the command said in order to go on and act. </span><span class="sentence" id="1694">However, we were more cautious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1695">We started to drive-in other <span class="REGION">areas</span> away, even to do our ammunition work, we did not go in the same format. </span><span class="sentence" id="1696">We changed; we had to go further away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">base</span> in order to keep on doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1697">For instance, to give you an example, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zelva</span> (ph) was the main <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and we started operating, going bad things around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zelva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1698">We would start crossing the Yemen on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , which it was the bigger <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1699">And certain changes in our operation was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1700">However, all of that within a few months brought a big German Army who wanted to get even now with the partisans, realizing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1701">And at that particular time, the fighting ensued for almost a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1702">And we were surrounded for quite a big <span class="DLF">perimeter</span> all the way around and afterwards our fight was not so much killing Germans as it was to work our way through a retreat, where we could go to a retreat in smaller groups through the bigger <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1703">Which we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1704">And in weeks later, in slow motion, with fewer people, we came back to the <span class="REGION">area</span> but in other parts of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1705">So, not to leave, we suffered a tremendous amount of casualties at that particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1706">And our reorganization was, I mean, the reorganization, speaking in the part of the Jewish partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1707">On that particular march, I was near Captain Bulat (ph) and he was the staff leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="1708">And he started the anti-Semitism, talking continually to me, and no matter how much defending I tried to do of the Jewish, it still was calling the Jewish all at once, he started to call them cowards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1709">I said, "How can you call them cowards? </span><span class="sentence" id="1710">Look at Balat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1711">He kept all his guys, the Rachen boys, up in the <span class="DLF">front line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1712">A few of them died, got killed, and look how they held the Germans for a whole day in position, and the Germans could not come forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="1713">Do you call that cowardness?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1714">I says, "You and I, I was in front with a machine gun and you were a few hundred yards in back of me when you asked me to go into the settlement over there, to find out, to see if the German's are still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1715">Did I back off?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="1716">No," he says. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1717">You were good; you were a brave guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1718">I'm not talking about you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1719">I said, "Then, why are you pluralizing it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1720">And after the talk all the time, the group of Atlas as we were to call them, as I have mentioned, the Dr. Atlas group, Lipsovich (ph) was the name of the commanding officer at the time, he come over to me, he says, "Harold, we were retreating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1721">We cannot go on with this here whole group because look at the anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="1722">Two Jewish girls were shot because they dropped their discs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1723">They were having the discs for the automatic weapons and while running and retreating, they dropped the discs, they shot the Jewish girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1724">There was no way out others could do." </span><span class="sentence" id="1725">So, they pleaded with me; they said, "Harold, please come with us." </span><span class="sentence" id="1726">I says, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1727">I will not join you for one reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">I do not want to make Captain Balot right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1729">I don't want for him to be able to pluralize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">So, while all of you are going, I wish you luck and I hope to meet you when it's all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">The next day after the Altas group left, Captain Balot got me again. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1732">Harold, you remember our conversation? </span><span class="sentence" id="1733">Look what happened to your cowards." </span><span class="sentence" id="1734">I says, "Why do you confront me with them? </span><span class="sentence" id="1735">I had nothing to do with them." </span><span class="sentence" id="1736">I says, "What happened to them?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">He says, "They all retreated." .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1738">QUESTION:  Why don't you stop this. . . ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1739">ANSWER:  The conversation ensued with all anti-Semitic flavor and he said, "They will be pushed once we go back to base." </span><span class="sentence" id="1740">Within a couple of days later, we decided to return. </span><span class="sentence" id="1741">So instead of going towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , now we decided to return back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">bases</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1742">On our way back, we realized of how many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlements</span> were burned by the Germans through the local area, and we realized was a big thing it will be right now for us to operate in these <span class="REGION">areas</span> <span class="REGION">local area</span> , and we realized was a big thing it will be right now for us to operate in these areas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1743">And they decided to come back firstly, to where the Dr. Atlas group was usually taking place, although they were right nearby and we ran up on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1744">No sooner we came there, the order was everybody stays in <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1745">I saw a friend of mine, Moses Agonik (ph), and he used to be a patrol guy who on the horse would always run forward for patrolling and finding out <span class="DLF">front line</span> news. </span><span class="sentence" id="1746">And I was a smoker at that time, and a heavy smoker. </span><span class="sentence" id="1747">So badly, we used to take leaves and crush the tobacco and roll it in newspaper to smoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="1748">It's hard to relate to everybody whoever smokes what a horrendous feeling that gives you to substitute, but that's what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1749">I see Moses over there; I says, "Moe, can I get a cigarette from you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1750">I stepped out of <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1751">No sooner that I stepped out of <span class="DLF">line</span> , Buresbulat (ph) is there and Buresbulat starts acting up, now he wants to shoot me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1752">He wants to shoot me right on the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1753">Now, being I'm among my good friends of commanders which I had Zeitsof (ph) who took me to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beshuti</span> (ph), which it was another one; Misha Dubokof (ph), and third one, and a few more came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1754">No, you're not going to shoot him; you're not going to kill him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1755">As they were my messiahs, in a way of speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="1756">And he didn't do it. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1757">Why did you step out of <span class="DLF">line</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1758">I says, "I didn't step out; just one foot, to get a cigarette from him." "</span><span class="sentence" id="1759">I said and I ordered, no one steps out of <span class="DLF">line</span> , and you did." </span><span class="sentence" id="1760">Basically, I realized that 1t was no more, no less, but the anti-Semitism in here, that he continued talking with me about; that's what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1761">But I was on the watch at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1762">Before long, they started to order, they wanted to shoot two more of the Rachen girls, who they understand, dropped their discs and we had one guy who was a Rachen guy, Benjamin Denbrovsky (ph); he used to be like the hang man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1763">Any time somebody had to be executed, Benjamin used to be the one to be called. </span><span class="sentence" id="1764">So, now Bulot has given him the assignment to take these two girls and he should go after them and shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1765">Well, an order is an order, so he went and the girls called and instead of him shooting them, he told them, "We are running. </span><span class="sentence" id="1766">I will not kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1767">Stay with me." </span><span class="sentence" id="1768">They all, at that particular time, ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="1769">When they did not hear any shots, they followed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1770">They killed the girls, but Ben, they couldn't get hold of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1771">He survived the war at , which it was a trap for Jews mainly, and that's where he survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1772">Because for him, disobeying an order for not shooting, he would have been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1773">He survived the war about Bensky (ph) and I met with him after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1774">So, --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1775">QUESTION:  Was there a lot of this justice system going on in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1776">ANSWER:  Well, at that particular time, as I am about to tell you, the system still did not work officially under the <span class="BUILDING">Soviet bases</span> , but it was just beginning to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1777">But since that was the big fight and the big onslaught by the Germans going on over there and the casualties that we suffered and when it was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1778">Above all, what it got them worse is, they came and they found that what did the Atlas guys do, they were cooking a whole <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> where they had the chickens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1779">And it was fine; you know what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="1780">That was another part that Jews liked chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1781">That was another fallacy, you know, what I mean, for anti- Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="1782">Why did I have chickens? </span><span class="sentence" id="1783">Since I aforementioned that so many <span class="NPIP">places</span> were burned out, there were a lot of chickens flying around on the loose, with no one now to take care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1784">So, they went away, cut the chickens, killed them and cooked them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1785">So, he did not even try. </span><span class="sentence" id="1786">Before long, Heir Libshovens (ph), the commander gave an order to his men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1787">He saw what was going on and he saw the anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="1788">They surrendered to our group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1789">His platoon was bigger at that time than the group we were, with machine guns and he went out talking to Bolot (ph). "</span><span class="sentence" id="1790">Are you going to call to order now and go back to staff and re-hash all the things, or are you going to out right now? </span><span class="sentence" id="1791">Remember one more move and we are going to use our machine guns." </span><span class="sentence" id="1792">And that's what attended for the day, the stuff returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1793">And Dr. Atlas group no longer was commanded by Leibshovitz, but Shuben became its commander and the group received a few more non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1794">So, to make a tone out of it, 1t looked like this: when things were bad, like they used to say in Polish, . </span><span class="sentence" id="1795">When it's bad, go ahead to start getting on the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1796">We were the blame, the scapegoats for everything, even at a time like this, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1797">So maybe this is again one reason why not more Jews came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1798">It was not because of anything else, because they had no ways of how to make contacts with the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1799">The guys in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> were not interested at that time to save Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1800">They were interested just to fight a war against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1801">But we did not have any helping hand to help Jews to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1802">We survived because we were there fighting but not because somebody tried to help us survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1803">And, unfortunately, that's the case; that's the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1804">This was a bad to swallow at that particular time because all of a sudden, the reorganization, I myself was sending from one, and I asked at that time, Zatsov and Buchlet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1805">They say, "Harold, I cannot keep you under my wing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1806">You might as well go to join . </span><span class="sentence" id="1807">That's the order that you got." </span><span class="sentence" id="1808">So I was re- settled to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1809">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Abromov</span> (ph) becomes my new <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , sort of to be with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1810">And that went on until a few months later, when the paratroopers joined us under the auspices of the General Costenko (ph) or we used to call him, Capusten (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1811">And I joined, I joined him, not because of my, I was assigned to join him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1812">And maybe that was another way of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Abromov</span> to get me out of, you know what I mean; not to be over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1813">And I and Polachek (ph), the other one who were assigned there, and at that time, I became platoon commander beforehand, but still and though, even my being the platoon commander, he singled out me and Polachek, the two, to go to be with the paratroopers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1814">And a new leaf in the history of the partisans had started at that particular time in our <span class="REGION">area</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1815">QUESTION:  This is, the date approximately?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1816">ANSWER:  I beg your pardon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1817">That was already 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1818">QUESTION:  Now, why don't we change here because he's just got a minute left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1819">End of Tape #7 Tape #8</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Because that was leading up to that attack that we had another attack by the Germans, to get even with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1820">That was, now we are talking of 1943, in the Spring.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1821">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1822">The other thing that, I know you've talked about this in different ways, but it's a little confusing 1s, there are all these different bands, and I'm wondering how coordinated your activities were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1823">I mean, there are all these different groups out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1824">I understand there was a battle to destroy a <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that you had come from, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> (ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1825">ANSWER:  Correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1826">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1827">Were you involved?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1828">ANSWER:  Yes, I was very much involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1829">As coming near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zotzof</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pescholey</span> (ph) at the time, and Misha Dubokov knew of me, and I was the one selected to take the commerce from the big massacre in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> to which company, and we were pleading with the command, I and the same thing, Somek Burnstein (ph) that please, let us go and attack the Rachen, less us go and attack the Rachen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1830">But the command still did not want to listen to us before the massacre happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1831">However after the massacre in the Rachen happened, and from that massacre to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , I would . </span><span class="sentence" id="1832">The people who were in the family camps to those who were assigned in the various command posts, in companies, I would say that may be 100 to 120 people were saved of a population in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span> to those who were assigned in the various command posts, in companies, I would say that may be 100 to 120 people were saved of a population in the ghetto, for at least seven or eight hundred. </span><span class="sentence" id="1833">That's how victorious the Germans were of killing the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1834">They did not take them anymore to the big dig that they had in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , but rather in the <span class="DLF">holes</span> that were left from the bombs in the middle, the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , that's where they killed them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1835">And some of them they even killed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and burned afterwards the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1836">So those of them who weren't hiding, had little chance to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1837">And that is, perhaps, was why the number of us are living. </span><span class="sentence" id="1838">Now, ...</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Can we just ask you for an approximate date, here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1839">ANSWER:  Let's see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1840">That would have to probably be, when was it in your time, 1943, the last massacre, or '42?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1841">QUESTION:  ‘42.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1842">ANSWER:  That's what I thought it was, '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="1843">We are talking about now, when we attacked the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> was at the tail end of summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1844">Or mid-summer of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="1845">So, at that particular time with having so many more people, survivors of the Rachen, everybody sort of was looking for a little vengeance on the police, a little vengeance on the Germans for the massacre that they carried out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1846">And command was knowing that we can get a lot of trophies in ammunition and everything like that, because they will not fight, no more than they didn't fight as before in other ambushes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1847">And they mustered up the force in all the <span class="REGION">areas</span> and all the partisans were divide in about four groups to make it so that we gave them only one <span class="REGION">area</span> from where to escape and all the other <span class="REGION">areas</span> that they tried to escape, they had to fall into our fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1848">I was assigned at that time to a group with Zitsof (ph) which I was with him together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1849">We both were having, he was having a machine gun and I was having a machine gun and while he had the machine gun, he was commanding also his flock. </span><span class="sentence" id="1850">In other words, of his <span class="DLF">line</span> , whatever he had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1851">We decided to attack about dawn, while it was still dark, about maybe at the hours between 5 and 6 in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1852">Our forces began to move in the <span class="REGION">area</span> at night, so really our forces did not have time to rest, but in small groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="1853">You could not move about five, six hundred partisans all to come in at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1854">So everybody was using a different direction and it took them the night hours to come to be in <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1855">QUESTION:  On foot, mostly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1856">ANSWER:  On foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1857">Some of them were on horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1858">The ones who were searching <span class="REGION">areas</span> and contact man with him, but all the troops were on foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1859">No other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1860">And the contact men only were on horses so that they could be able to speed up to tell from the command, you know, we did not have no radios or anything like that at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1861">So, we started mustering the forces at night because by night, the movement could be not so visible as to alert the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> that something is going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1862">We decided there has to be attack early in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1863">The signal was a rocket that I would shoot in the <span class="DLF">air</span> from my horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1864">And once the rocket was shoot, fire starts and with the words of "Hurrah," the Russian way, our men begin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1865">The machine guns that were meant near the police first, we shot them out immediately because we made the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , by the time they realized it was an attack, and to muster the police who were asleep, and the Germans, we already were near the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , surrendered and hand grenades began flopping from everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1866">So the Germans and the police did not ensue in a fight for more than about an hour in all, put together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1867">And all they were doing is looking for <span class="NPIP">places</span> where to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="1868">We collected quite a number of them prisoners of war and the prisoners were tied, their hands in the back and were immediately sent to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , and which, later on, they would stand trial and they were convicted, in other words to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1869">And they were one by one shot in the presence of the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1870">And, at that particular time, we were very overwhelmed of how little an effort it was to knock the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> out, because really there looks like did not have chance enough to build a position. </span><span class="sentence" id="1871">However, I must make a point here; after it was all over and the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> retreated back, that's when around this here <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> where the police force was staying, they built a <span class="DLF">wall</span> with <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> that if we were to have this here kind of <span class="BUILDING">building</span> before, we would never be able to succeed to attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="1872">We made use of the time, since the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> was a slaughter house, that the slaughter house became busy, slaughtering meat, and it was salted down into wooden barrels and sent to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> by a contingency of partisans that we had who were capable of making salami and so on, and they were salted down as to food and scattered around the various parts of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> <span class="BUILDING">slaughter house</span> , that the <span class="BUILDING">slaughter house</span> became busy, slaughtering meat, and it was salted down into wooden barrels and sent to the forest by a contingency of partisans that we had who were capable of making salami and so on, and they were salted down as to food and scattered around the various parts of the forest, which only a few people knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1873">So, in the event we should have been surrounded and not be able to go out, that we should be able to have supplies for where to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1874">My good friend, Barnovsky, (ph) was leading on, we told of this year, doing, he was a butcher by trade and he knew the art of making the salami and all of that do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1875">So, he was leading and it became a very busy <span class="NPIP">place</span> , that <span class="BUILDING">slaughter house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1876">To tell you, we kept it for almost three months and until the Germans decided to make an onslaught and come back to return to their bases. </span><span class="sentence" id="1877">With Zidsov (ph) as I went into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I came into a Gentile person who knew even my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1878">And he touched me badly, the way he said it in Russian, " ," which translated into English, means, "Are you still alive?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1879">And it rubbed me the wrong way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1880">Had I not had Commander Zitsov with me, I would have ended him right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1881">But being with my Commander Zitsov with me, I pretended that I didn't take it, instead of him showing the joy that I am alive, he asked me, "Are you still alive?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1882">So, and that rubbed me in the wrong way and he ordered us, he ordered for him and his wife to make breakfast for us and a few more from the command came into the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1883">And even though we had to drink and to eat, but these few words never left me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1884">And I had a hard time, sort of, forgetting about it, that even after I left all of my family and lost them over here, that that man would have the audacity to ask me, one person who remained alive, in these words, with his cruel words: "Are you still alive?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1885">And he thought that that was a way of greeting me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1886">In other words, that he sort of jokingly thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="1887">I did not make any mention in front of my commander, but my anger was burning in me, coming back in the <span class="NPIP">places</span> where I did not even know which of the <span class="DLF">holes</span> my family is buried, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1888">Because they threw lime afterwards on it and it was brought to burial, the <span class="REGION">area</span> , after the war when the partisans returned to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1889">It was a big piece of news for the whole <span class="REGION">area</span> , because the respect date. </span><span class="sentence" id="1890">And what we invited upon ourselves, after that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , after that Rachen occupation and what we do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1891">That the Germans had to bring a tremendous force in surrendering all the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , extending maybe in diameter, maybe 30 to 40 miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1892">Which, again, for the Soviet Union, it served a good purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1893">When they have to take in one <span class="REGION">area</span> to use so much military to do a big job like that, the <span class="DLF">front line</span> is . </span><span class="sentence" id="1894">That's when the Soviets were winning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1895">But, it was a lot of casualties on our part and that Fall, when they made, because we were so sure of ourselves that we became too cocky. </span><span class="sentence" id="1896">We used to travel by day, coming to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> ; going here and doing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1897">We thought there is no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> that it can stop us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1898">And this is the time that we relaxed a little bit too much and the casualties happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1899">So then we heard the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> coming in, we started on the edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> from all <span class="NPIP">places</span> to put up, at that time, a defense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1900">And we didn't wait for them to attack us, we started to attack them, realizing the kind of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> and the kind of fighting that no longer were we dealing with the police, the local alone, but at this time we were dealing with a trained Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1901">So, our command immediately recognized the situation and they broke through an <span class="REGION">area</span> in a few <span class="NPIP">places</span> to make it, and we were ordered to retreat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1902">We retreated until the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> almost around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilda</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1903">It was very, a traumatic move at that time for us, that all of a sudden, we had to, I would say in miles, I would say we must have retreated about 150 yards from our base. </span><span class="sentence" id="1904">The good part of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">base</span> was that we knew the names of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlements</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1905">We knew which way it leads. </span><span class="sentence" id="1906">And then you come in a strange <span class="NPIP">place</span> altogether, it was hard to go ahead to carry out any of the type of work that they did over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1907">So it was a set back port partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1908">The good news however was that after that, we saw the paratroopers come in to the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1909">So, 1943, about mid, we decided to organize a new action.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1910">QUESTION:  I want to go back for a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1911">You have mentioned on and off a Dr. Atlas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1912">I believe he was also involved in that battle, so I want you to tell me something about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1913">Who was he? </span><span class="sentence" id="1914">What kind of a man he was? </span><span class="sentence" id="1915">What he was doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1916">ANSWER:  At the battle of the Rachen, Dr. Atlas was involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1917">And he retreated away from the Rachen quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1918">Not with his troops, because he had some medical missions that he had to attend to at that particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1919">While he was the commander, he still used to attend to certain patients, which was farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1920">His good rule, what he did to the farmers helped us with leads of informers that we could get. </span><span class="sentence" id="1921">And because they wanted Dr. Atlas to continue with the work, we prospered with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1922">So, yes; he was in the battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1923">He originally was leading his platoon over there to the Rachen, but he after it was over, the fight was over, he had to retreat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1924">His men remained there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1925">Now, for instance, we knew a few casualties of the Rachen boys who did lose their life, like I mentioned before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1926">Benjamin Dumbrovsky, he lost his brother at that particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1927">But all the casualties we had were due to bravery; they were really fighting and they really wanted to see and show the police over there that somebody has got to be accountable for the way they did in that massacre against the Jews so well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1928">QUESTION:  Did his platoon come from that <span class="REGION">area</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1929">ANSWER:  The platoon that he was leading was, I would say, about 80 percent of the Jewish people who came from the Rachen and they came after the massacre of the Rachen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1930">That's why they were so eager in the fight of to go back and sort of, vengeance was a good driving force in them, to do what they were doing at the present time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1931">So, it was not idealogy in part, all the way, that they were trying to fight for the Soviets, but a lot of times it was vengeance against those who did so cruel to our families there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1932">So his platoon remained until afterwards when the General's staff ordered everybody to retreat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1933">Because after the first day, or the second day, we used to go back by day to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> <span class="FOREST">forests</span> and by night come and still do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1934">We did not want to get caught in the big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> that the Germans should go ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1935">So we used to have, more or less, platoons, a platoon maybe would stand guard and about on the lookout over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1936">But the whole Army was where we were, about five or six hundred partisans, were sent back to their <span class="BUILDING">bases</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1937">Dr. Atlas was also a DP like I was myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1938">I knew him not like I knew, for instance, the other doctors; no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1939">QUESTION:  But you came in contact with him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1940">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1941">It's worth mentioning here, about Dr. Atlas's past. </span><span class="sentence" id="1942">He was a displaced person, like I. He was someplace from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1943">And that man practiced medicine all the time and with the German onslaught, the way it happened, he decided to be treating patience on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1944">So he, instead of remaining in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , was away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he used to, sort of, be the doctor of the farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1945">And they did not disclose him from the Germans, to the Germans, rather. </span><span class="sentence" id="1946">With the onslaught and organization of partisans, as soon as he heard about partisans in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , he came voluntarily and joined but he still maintained a good relationship with the <span class="REGION">farming area</span> over there and they became very useful to the partisans, right now for the information. </span><span class="sentence" id="1947">He was a man about my height, slimmer than me, I mean you know, I wasn't as fat as Iam now, but a little slimmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1948">And he had one thing, you could see fire in this man, talking to his guys all the time about vengeance and fight. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1949">When you going to fight, fight to the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1950">Fight to win." </span><span class="sentence" id="1951">And he was a good leading commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="1952">We had a lot more of, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buloks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1953">Bulok was a local commander who had mostly Gentiles, or the other Russians, not so much of the Soviets, true Soviets, who remained in the <span class="REGION">area</span> that didn't go into the prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1954">But he organized his group mostly from his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlement area</span> and around there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1955">So the people, as I say, his group, they all used to ride more, a lot on horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1956">So, they would come because they had their own <span class="DLF">farms</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1957">So a lot of them used to have to man the <span class="DLF">farms</span> , and at night, whatever the partisans needs was today, they would be working on that <span class="DLF">front line</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1958">But the unfortunate situation happens, Dr. Atlas, in one of the big ambushes, which it was following after the liberation of the Rachen, that's when Dr. Atlas is killed in battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1959">So, I mean, he didn't die just a normal death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1960">He was killed while fighting, being a fighter and commanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1961">That's when the takes over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1962">That man, I just mentioned, misfortunately meets his death in , in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , while on his way escaping the Soviet Union, and while on the way in a kubutz (ph) which it was illegal immigration to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1963">And being <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on patrol, a Polak shot and killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1964">As you've heard perhaps or not, that in and in other parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , after 1945, when the war as over, and the Jews were running from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or from hiding, they still were not ready to give away what they robbed from the Jews, so they had one way of doing it: kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1965">And therefore, we know later on, what went on in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1966">So, a lot of these guys like , met their death after liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1967">And it was a big hurt to feel that a guy was patriotic all the way and that that was the way for him to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1968">So, why almost after three years in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , or two and a half years, rather, and being in battle and to come out all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1969">In the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> he only lost his sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1970">His brothers, the other two brothers that survived, to the best of my knowledge, are in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1971">QUESTION:  Now, we have I guess about ten more minutes and I'm wondering. </span><span class="sentence" id="1972">There are two thoughts that I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1973">Either, and maybe you can explain to me about this reorganization that took place?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1974">ANSWER:  Yep.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1975">QUESTION:  Or possibly tell me about an experience, or running into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span> , whichever you think is appropriate at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1976">ANSWER:  Well, I can tell you first about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span> , rather than getting into this subject, because that's a more lengthy subject to talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1977">I did not mention at great length, that in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> <span class="FOREST">forests</span> there were also <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1978">However, let us make clear about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1979">When I use that word, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span> , I only mean others an expression. </span><span class="sentence" id="1980">It was not a camp of people with families or elderly, that they were supervised by others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1981">It's just that they were, sort of, not elected to be able to be among the fighting force. </span><span class="sentence" id="1982">And therefore, when we came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> <span class="FOREST">forests</span> , escaping from the massacres, there was only one thing for them to do, and that was to be in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1983">So, a lot of them, a majority of them who were capable, joined one company or the other and they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1984">And those who couldn't, for instance, had the lot left to them to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1985">Every time the Germans attacked the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , the ambush or otherwise, the big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> or small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span> were the first prey that they attacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1986">And at times, it was, they were going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , sort of, with victory, thinking that they killed partisans while they actually, the one that they killed was the ones in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1987">Because as soon as the shooting was started, not too far where we were in our camps, so we would exactly, at that particular time join and attack them instead of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1988">And from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span> , they had an easy prey. </span><span class="sentence" id="1989">All they could throw is a few hand grenades, open up a machine gun and boom, then they found them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1990">So, those who were living in hiding survived the massacre, or the onslaught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1991">Those who were not living in hide outs, but they just lived in the open, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1992">They were first prey. </span><span class="sentence" id="1993">So, the other <span class="NPIP">part</span> was, while we had so many fighting groups, really, no one cared to provide the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span> with provisions, even food or clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1994">However, some of them had relatives, brothers or other ones, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">fighting camps</span> , which they would care to bring something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1995">But, 1t was never an organized effort by the partisans, in the <span class="REGION">area</span> that I was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1996">I don't know what it was in other <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> <span class="FOREST">forests</span> ; maybe in other <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> <span class="FOREST">forests</span> it was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1997">But, I believe that we would have heard about it and know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1998">They were an open prey. </span><span class="sentence" id="1999">They escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="2000">At types, they used to have problems with the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="2001">The partisans, especially the women, and there were younger girls; the partisans, in most cases the Gentiles, would come and rape them, attack them in this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="2002">So they were open prey to all kinds of enemies: our local enemies, the partisans which they couldn't protect themselves from, and against the Germans and the police when they would attack and they would normally, you know what I mean, pick their <span class="NPIP">spots</span> as of their probably spies them where they were located and that's what it would be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2003">QUESTION:  Did, do you think that Jewish members of the partisans ever took advantage of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span> in that way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2004">ANSWER:  The Jewish guys used to help one way or the other, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2005">But, that was, again, a not official way, it was an unofficial way. </span><span class="sentence" id="2006">That we would sometimes drop some food over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2007">But we were starting to stop over there to visit and usually we would come with some food leaving them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2008">But it was not a case that a command told us, "Hey, why didn't you deliver some potatoes from wherever you can, or something else, to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camp</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="2009">The family camps were strictly left on their own and if we were to have the figures at hand and starting to make justification or comparisons, we would find that the biggest amount of casualties as per amount coming to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span> were strictly left on their own and if we were to have the figures at hand and starting to make justification or comparisons, we would find that the biggest amount of casualties as per amount coming to the forest, was from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2010">QUESTION:  Was there constant enemy presence? </span><span class="sentence" id="2011">I mean, were you always afraid of bombing and advances?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2012">ANSWER:  That was the life, at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="2013">It was war and we were in that war. </span><span class="sentence" id="2014">It did not matter perimeter, where the <span class="DLF">front line</span> is. </span><span class="sentence" id="2015">To us, the front line was everywhere, because we never, we used to catch here and there spies, would come running in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> <span class="DLF">front line</span> was everywhere, because we never, we used to catch here and there spies, would come running in the forest that the Germans sent. </span><span class="sentence" id="2016">They used to send in ex-POWs, you know what I mean, which they sent in. </span><span class="sentence" id="2017">We found them with maps and insignia on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2018">And of course, when we found them, they met death, you know what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="2019">But, it was officially, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2020">The company would come out and it would be read the order, who and what it was discovered and therefore, they were executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2021">But, 1t was in a military kind of a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="2022">So, to tell you, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> <span class="FOREST">forests</span> were full of all kind of problems, while they served of a lot of help, to help Jews survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="2023">But, it did not happen as a means for Jewish survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="2024">It happened because the way it happened to be that it served as the base for survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="2025">But they were not with open arms, let us get Jews in. </span><span class="sentence" id="2026">Jews were not taken in so easily, like I told you when I was, before when I was coming in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2027">What do you think? </span><span class="sentence" id="2028">We have ammunition for them? </span><span class="sentence" id="2029">That was not the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="2030">The case is, if you're out to help or to save, that's the salvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="2031">But if not, that's the case we don't have, how are we going to take in more? </span><span class="sentence" id="2032">And again, when we were talking about attacking the Rachen, before the massacre, that was our main course; that was to come in to tell them that a young people will join us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2033">But they did not want to hear but we will take the Rachen after the massacre, where we could have saved so much more lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2034">QUESTION:  During this period of time, did you have one moment or one episode that was the most terrifying to you, or was this just the life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2035">ANSWER:  If there was one episode, I don't know which way to place it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2036">I was on a mission at one time to save one Jewish girl from the Rachen, who a policeman at the massacre, he looks like he was in love with her and she was in love with him, save her and took upon himself to take him to his <span class="DLF">farm</span> , where his parents were, and they kept her there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2037">And all of a sudden, we got word in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> that Sonia no longer can stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2038">She became the wife later of who I have mentioned before, who was a commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="2039">But sent me for one reason or another only that I came telling her, there's a young girl, good looking, and if you want me to bring her here, you'll have a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="2040">So, it was sort of like you cannot say that the interest of the commander to permit me to go on that mission to save her was of humane? </span><span class="sentence" id="2041">No, it wasn't of humane. </span><span class="sentence" id="2042">It was, the was a nice man and he layer winds up being with her after the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="2043">But he, it was just a matter of exchange, sort of; you know what I mean’? </span><span class="sentence" id="2044">Who cares? </span><span class="sentence" id="2045">And I risked my life, although I wasn't a native from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2046">But I was there, again, because the Dr. Atlas group probably had the same thing and the question would always be, how come they didn't? </span><span class="sentence" id="2047">I did it for one basic reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="2048">The news came to us through a contact and I went to and told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2049">And he says, "Would you want to go to bring her?" </span><span class="sentence" id="2050">I says, "Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="2051">She's a nice woman." </span><span class="sentence" id="2052">And I brought her. </span><span class="sentence" id="2053">But it was a big risk for me, a one-man operation, to go to organize it, through our contact man. </span><span class="sentence" id="2054">Which I did through the prior knowledge of the staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="2055">The staff would never have permitted me to do a thing like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2056">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2057">The staff would have said to me, "Sure, she wants to come? </span><span class="sentence" id="2058">Meet her halfway. </span><span class="sentence" id="2059">Meet her at the edge of some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlement</span> from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> and if she comes there, you'll take her. </span><span class="sentence" id="2060">But I risked and I had to make them believe that I'm here with a little Army to surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="2061">And she was dressed like a little farm girl and she came out over there and when we meet, I sort of started to pretend that there 1s the other guys, all came with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2062">And until I was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> , she herself thought that what I'm talking is really something. </span><span class="sentence" id="2063">And the whole night it took me to walk until in the morning until I brought her. </span><span class="sentence" id="2064">So, is that an important case? </span><span class="sentence" id="2065">Was the onslaught in the Rachen when I was in full and important case? </span><span class="sentence" id="2066">Was when we attacked? </span><span class="sentence" id="2067">Again, when I was next to the Howitzer and we were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2068">And it was a big fight there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2069">That's an important part for me to tell about that fight because the Jewish heroes were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2070">End of Tape #8 Conclusion of interview. </span>
