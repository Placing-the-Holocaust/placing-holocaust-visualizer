<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER:  Good afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">QUESTION:  Could you first tell us something about yourself, where you grew up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  Well, I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> to a well- to- do family on November 3, 1924 and I was brought up at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">We had a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shaborov</span> which was about 20 minutes train ride from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where I would spend the summers. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Later on I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew academy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and went through my <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> there, and had my Bar Mitzvah in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> in the great <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and remember playing in the <span class="DLF">parks</span> and doing the things that kids do. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I had two brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My younger brother was named Syzmon. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">He was born in 1928, 27, excuse me, and was roughly three years younger than me and I had another brother Meir who was born when I was already nine years old, in 1934. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I remember his birthday in particular because it just so happens that my grandmother's sister and her husband and their young daughter, about my age, came for a visit to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and it was a big event in our lives to see the Americans visiting us. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">So despite the language barrier between us kids; because they could speak Yiddish, you know, the grandparents could speak Yiddish and my parents could speak, it was something of a sensation in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to see, you know we were not used yet to see kids that were not disciplined, sort of dominate the attention of the whole <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And after graduating what you would call <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , I was admitted to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , which is <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and went there for one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">But about that time, the clouds of war began to gather and my father thought of sending me to <span class="BUILDING">agricultural school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I guess the reasoning behind that decision was the fact, well there were several considerations. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">One, that I was not doing so greatly in <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  You weren't the greatest student in the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Except for history which I took genuine interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I didn't show great promise at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I don't know in what order of urgency these considerations came but there was the consideration that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , they came and for the Jews and my father already at that time, I think <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was already next to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was next in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">frying pan</span> and blackmailed by Hitler at the time, you know the whole incident with Sudetenland and so forth, that served as a pretext for German aggression there. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">At any rate, my father felt that immigration became imperative for us and he felt that someone with a farming background would have a greater chance of being admitted to a <span class="REGION">foreign country</span> than a merchant or professional. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I don't know just how true that was but farmers were always readily admitted to <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> like <span class="REGION">South America</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20"><span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> was then considered unpopulated and my father mentioned <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> as one of the possibilities of our immigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So the decision was made that I should become a farmer or at least I should learn farming and I was sent to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wajenuswolinsky</span> {ph 55} about 350 kilometers southeast of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and I began my education in farming there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  All of 1938?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  This was the summer of 1938 because I arrived there just in time for harvest which was the worst period from the standpoint of work, the fact that we had to work nothing like we consider work today, from sunrise to sunset. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">But once the harvest was over, then we began class work. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">As the season neared winter, work was progressively reduced and class work increased. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And that’s the way it went. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">But of course, I never graduated from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because the war broke out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  Which work did you like or dislike the most, the schoolwork or the physical labor in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  Well, I was not too much enamored by the work in the <span class="DLF">field</span> but I did like work with the animals, with horses and cows and other animals we had there on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I found it very interesting and I became a very good student there, too, so that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had from a standpoint of my upbringing and maturing, had a very favorable effect on my attitude towards learning and many other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">So much so far that I surprised my parents when they saw my school report.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Were there other Jewish students at this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  There were only Jewish students at this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">This <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was under the auspices of an organization called Tarbot which I think is Hebrew name for culture and the principle objective there was to train Jews in agriculture so they can immigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and become farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">This was also a consideration even though my father when he mentioned <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> as a possible place for our immigration, he considered <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> as well but unfortunately, the British then had a policy of, a restricted policy of immigration to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and it is a strange thing that when we mention today <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , today <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> has a completely different connotation. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">In WW II. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">The Palestine brigade that fought with the British 8" Army, consisted of Jews alone from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> as it became. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Now the connotation conjures visions of intifada and mayhem and gang of cutthroats, you know that are
QUESTION:  Anti-Jewish in a word.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Anti-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  So this was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that was affiliated with the Zionists?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  Zionist orientated. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">It was, you might say it was soft on religion, aspect of it, but the religious life in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was accented to a certain degree and all the holidays were observed and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I remember that we did not work in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> on a Sunday, besides Saturday, also not on Sunday in order not to offend the Christian peasants 1n the <span class="REGION">area</span> , to respect because it was their day of rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So we were only working internally on the <span class="DLF">grounds</span> , on the <span class="DLF">grounds</span> proper.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  Were there any Socialistic aspects in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  So it was more religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  It was mainly Zionist oriented and graduate students went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> after finishing this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">In fact, there was a reunion of survivors of that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 1966, 1967 I think and I happened to be there for the Bar Mitzvah of my second son, Matthew and we found out that there were about half a dozen survivors, all of them living in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> except me, so they made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">They joked around and they said “ Topas remained the only Zionist among us”. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Because I was living in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and they were there and they served in the Israeli army, one of them achieved a very high rank in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And only one of the fellows that graduated the <span class="BUILDING">farming school</span> remained a farmer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  Did you dream of going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> during that year you were at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I had my sites set for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">It was something very attractive to us, to be in a <span class="REGION">land</span> that historically we take our roots from and for a couple of millennium there was a continuous history of the Jewish people and since we are persona non grata in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in most of the countries of the world in general, then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> loomed very largely in our consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  Were there any other reasons why you ended up going to this particular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , do you recall what it was like to be Jewish and to go to <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> for higher education at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  I have never been exposed to, I have been only once in <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> for a very brief period, one year that my mother sent me to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I don’t remember the circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">But other than that, I was always going, for instance, the <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> that I went to, the <span class="BUILDING">prep school</span> so to speak was a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew academy</span> , one of the most modern of it’s kind and had a religious orientation. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Modern. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Then I went to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> henu which the Hebrew word denotes upbringing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Then I went to this <span class="BUILDING">Tarbot School</span> and I think the reason they sent me there was they wanted me to be in a traditionally Jewish environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  How would you describe the religious life with your family when you were growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Well the religious life with the family is really interesting in itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">To that extent that my grandparents were assimilated on my father’s side, not my mother’s side. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But since the grandparents on my mother’s side lived in a distance away from us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forst</span> we didn’t have much contact with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , we virtually lived with our grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">We were living in the same <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">My grandparents were assimilated; they did not observe the Jewish holidays according to the law, meaning our <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were open on Saturday; although holidays like Passover and others were observed, they were observed to the extent they didn’t interfere with business. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And my father was a very strong opponent of assimilation himself and he sort of fashioned himself or fancied himself as a Polish patriot. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So in 1920 during the Bolshevik invasion, he joined the Polish militia at the age of 16, probably not telling exactly the truth about his age. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">He was so bent to have a part of it you know in defense of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">But as he matured, he was exposed to the anti-Semitism that the assimilation did not make a damn bit of difference to the anti-Semites. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">All the Jews are the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So he was a thinking individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">One of his pastimes, his contemporaries told me was going to <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> and listening to trials because he liked the idea of logic expressed and the questions of law, questions of morality, questions of right and wrong, very interested, good and evil. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So eventually, eventually, he became aware that, or he came to the conclusion, that assimilation for the Jews as a means of acceptance in a non-Jewish society was a failure and he felt 1t was a bankrupt. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Although many people at the time majority disagreed with him and he was a maverick in his belief. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So at time already when I had reached the age of 7, he became religious.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  So by the time you were seven he had concluded that assimilation was
ANSWER:  He might have concluded earlier but this was when he had made the move. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> became kosher and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Because in my childhood we had a Christmas tree and we were well-to-do so it was fashionable at that time to hire German governesses because they were so clean and disciplined and so forth and I remember kneeling and clasping my hands to say a prayer in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">This was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">But this radically has changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">For my father became religious and began to realize that the values that are contained in our tradition now, Torah and our bible, are the values that are endurable, they are tested and that society, it is to benefit not only to the Jews but to mankind to live by a law when morality is supreme, not other things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  Did you notice this when you were seven? </span><span class="sentence" id="89">This must have come as a major change.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  It was a major change. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">In fact, I remember exactly the time when my father made me aware that Iam a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Because I was sheltered you know in my life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and I was not exposed to the, I never found myself in a situation where I was exposed to anti- Semitism nor did I understand what it really meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> so I was Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">That’s the way I understood it. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But one time when we were in our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the summer, I might have been then seven, that I recall that towards evening my father called me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and he told me to sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I want to talk to you and he told me very briefly that we are Jewish and that we were enslaved in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> because this is the core of our belief and of the historical, factual tenets of our belief and that we were taken out of <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> to become a free people., </span><span class="sentence" id="97">to become a people to be a light to the nations. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">He said a few things that were just beyond me perhaps but then I came to learn this and I was taken out of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I was going to and I was sent to a more religious oriented school. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And we underwent a revolution and somewhere we were alienated from our larger family circle because of my father’s change.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  Your youngest brother then, he would have grown up from day one in a very religious household.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  You are very observant. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">That is exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">When I gave you the names, I told you that my name was Yusick because I was born in the era when my father was in the mood of giving Polish names and my brother’s name was given originally in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanislav</span> although his Hebrew name that was given at his circumcision was Szymon just as mine was Benjamin Josef for Joseph Benjamin. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">But when my third brother was born, it was already in the era when my father’s orientation was completely changed, the name that was given to him was Meir, after my grandfather’s father. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">He was brought in completely different atmosphere from birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  Would you describe your father as a strict father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  I think that I would have to say yes, as a strict father. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Although he could have been quite relaxed, you know, and forgiving on occasions, but he was strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">He believed that the key word we have to focus our attention is righteousness. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">To him, this is all and all -- to be right, to be moral, to be truthful. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">He felt that our civilization as we know it stands or falls with our ability to comprehend that. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">That this is significant. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Of course, today, this is all turned upside down by the new social science engineering which says everything goes and everybody can have his own style and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  How would you describe your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  My mother came from a <span class="BUILDING">religious home</span> but she was somewhat of a rebel. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Perhaps not consciously so but it was simply a question of economics. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">She was born as one of four sisters to a family where the head of the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , meaning her father, my grandfather, Hersh Aram, was a hat maker. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And he was a working person and he was also Talmudist, studist. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">When he was not working he was spending his time in a <span class="BUILDING">house of study</span> , in a <span class="BUILDING">religious house</span> of study. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Now, she did not see any, this is by conjecture, she didn’t see future in following this tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Because they didn’t have big dowries. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">At that time, dowries had to be given with daughters to anybody who was worth his weight in salt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  And you had a grandfather with four daughters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Yeah, four daughters and she was the second in lineage. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Three of the four daughters went into the professions because they have seen they have to establish some economic independence. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">There was just no future for them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Excuse me, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">It is still a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">It is now even more significant. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I guess <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> calls it the capital of petro chemicals in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And I revisited the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> when I was there in 1989 and I found the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where my grandparents lived and possibly where they brought up these four daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Now, this, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> would be way below poverty level because the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> consisted of one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and six people lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">It is just hard to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And I remember visiting there on Passover and my father would take us there and they were always immaculately clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Everything was so perfect -- they didn’t have running water. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">They didn’t have a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , no plumbing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">It was just a bewilderment when we first came to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">My father already became religious at that time because before, we didn’t go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And it was contrast of two worlds that were completely, you know, there was the cosmopolitan <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> with <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> that were polished to a mirror shine with two maids in my grandma’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and plumbing and a bidet in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and all the conveniences and amenities of modern living. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Whereas in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Proust</span> , it was backwards, only by contrast and they had to live there very frugally. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So my mother must have realized early in her life that her future lie with her ability to support herself and to make something of herself, other than just being a woman and going through the biological process. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Her older sister Franya, you’ ll find out in my book, they’re in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , you'll find out that she had two boys and she was married to a painting contractor but she herself was a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">My mother was going for law but she married a wealthy husband, a well- to-do husband, a merchant, a businessman and Idacha the younger sister became a CPA, you know a public accountant. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I don’t know if she was certified, 1f such a thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  A notary?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  She was definitely a notary and she was also a bookkeeper. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And the youngest one was with the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I don’t think she went in to a profession; she remained at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and never married. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">They all perished in the Holocaust, except my grandfather who died a few years before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">The youngest daughter’s name was Razel. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So this was the background. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">When my mother came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , she in the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">school of law</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">In other words, you must realize that I believe that only 5 or 3% of the Jews could be admitted to any <span class="BUILDING">state institution</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">She had first to get through <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , an eight year course. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">As she said in her own application here the document that I obtained from the archives, she says on her basis of her entry examination she was admitted to the state’s <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">She covered a course of 8+ course in 7 or 8 years, perhaps in 7 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And then she was admitted to <span class="BUILDING">University of Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Before, they had this clause about bench clause and father restrictions but there were still restrictions about how many Jews could be admitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And she had two handicaps -- being Jewish and being a woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  And being from a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> standards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  By <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> standards. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So in order to support herself, one of the jobs she had was a tutor to the Topas boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So she was a tutor to my father and his brother Itzak and his youngest brother which was my uncle Ben. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And this is how people fell in love with the tutor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  Not everyone has such a beautiful tutor. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">A; Well, the results were predictable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  Your father was smitten.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  He must have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And he married very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">My mother at the time was 23 and he was 19 when they married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  Did your grandparents have any say in this matter? </span><span class="sentence" id="172">It must have not been the planned marriage of their dreams.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  Indeed, it was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">As I understand it in retrospect, they were very much opposed to it, because in Europe it was not like in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> where you have misalliances between rich and poor and between professional and non-professional. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">There was a class-consciousness, even among Jews so that it was unlikely that a person from a well-to-do family would marry someone from a very poor family by contrast. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And my grandparents were opposing too on the ground that the fact that they wanted someone from a more prestigious family than some obscure <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they didn’t like the idea that my mother was older than he. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Four years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">They didn’t like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">But apparently they were overruled.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  By your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  Probably by my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">He wanted to have his way. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">My mother was never very happy living in such close proximity to my father’s family because she realized the objection and she realized she was married over these objections.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  Interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">How about your father’s brothers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  My father’s brothers were not affected by this religious revolution and my uncle Neteck which was the second in line was a very handsome bachelor as you can see from the existing photographs, who was a bachelor for a long time and didn’t get married until probably maybe a year or two before the outbreak of WWII and his position in the company was that he had the job of administrator of the properties that my grandparents possessed, owned, and he was also the head bookkeeper in the company that fabricated shoes, <span class="BUILDING">Topaz Shoe Company</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">But I have very fond memories of my uncle the bachelor. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Bachelors have money. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Married people have responsibilities and bills. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And he lived with the grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">So my brother Szymon and I and my cousin Lela, which was the daughter of my father’s sister Bella Necovyak who lived with them there, we would come on Sunday morning when my dear uncle Neteck was still sleeping in his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> from the Saturday night outing trying to recover, we would be waiting for him to wake up sort of helping the process and then we would mooch from him movie money for the matinee to go and see the movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And we would scan the daily paper to tell him what are the choices and he would open one eye and say are you here already. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And he knew to buy his peace he had top give us some movie money and then we would ask him for transportation for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Sometimes he would say, “It’s such a beautiful day, why don’t you go to the <span class="DLF">park</span> ?’ “</span><span class="sentence" id="195">Why do you always have to go to the movie?” </span><span class="sentence" id="196">That is one of my fond memories that he was very generous that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I also remember that he bought me my first two -wheeler. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">My parents probably couldn’t afford it, even though they were well off but they had expenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">QUESTION:  And kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">ANSWER:  And kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">That means the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  Now I remember that your brother, from your description, he had to have been a hell of a nice guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I don’t know whether he was a great student.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  Who is that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">QUESTION:  Your uncle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">ANSWER:  Neteck? </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I don’t think that he distinguished himself particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">He graduated <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">He might have taken a course in bookkeeping and administration, I don’t know exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">But the one who distinguished himself scholastically was the youngest son, Benack. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">He was distinguished in many sports too, that’s why we remember him. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">The newspaper clippings would tell us about his prowess as a soccer player on a team called Hapoyal which was one of the first line teams in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">It was a Jewish team. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Hapoyal means the worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">That didn’t sit well with my grandparents who first of all were opposed to any socialist ideas and my grandmother thought it was a sheer waste of time to be engaged in sports of any kind and incur an injury or something like this and I understand he incurred an injury and he had blood infection. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">But I remember that when he graduated <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and I was still then very young, he didn’t want to go or perhaps he couldn’t get admission although he was a very good student, to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Warsaw</span> and he wanted to go for chemical engineering. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So he went to the <span class="BUILDING">Polytechnic</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and became an excellent chemist in his <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">He survived the war and when he came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> he couldn’t get any employment. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">But eventually he got a job with Dutch copper and later on with <span class="BUILDING">Merck Pharmaceuticals</span> when he distinguished himself in silicone research and made some pittance for them and later on became a director of research and went to <span class="BUILDING">Marshall Rectify</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> and he told me one time that the rectifier that weighs about a ton made by General Electric was made by him that weighs as much as a book of matches.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">QUESTION:  We were talking about your uncle Benack, the chemical engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">You were saying that he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to study.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  In the <span class="BUILDING">German Polytechnic</span> there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">QUESTION:  In the 1930’s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  In the 1930’s, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">QUESTION:  Just before the Nazis came to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  What was he planning to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="227">When he finished graduating, what would he have done in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">ANSWER:  Well, in fact he did graduate and he got a job with a sub clinical lab in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> so he was gainfully employed as a chemical engineer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Q; And what were you hoping to become: I remember you were interested in history and also you had an inclination toward animal husbandry after that first experience at the <span class="BUILDING">college</span> in <span class="REGION">southeastern Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">What was on your mind to be?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  Well, once I got my feet wet in this <span class="BUILDING">agricultural school</span> that my parents sent me, I really became fired with enthusiasm for being a farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I thought it was a great life, I thought it was a meaningful life because being close to the soil, you are close to <span class="ENV_FEATURES">nature</span> and it 1s a very healthy life and since there is some ideological being associated with it because of Jews, basically we are a nation of farmers and freeholders. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">If you study ancient history, you’ll find out that in it’s classical period, the kingdom of David and the kingdom of Solomon when the fortunes of the Jews were at it’s highest peak, most people were farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">There were some , but they didn’t have a class of merchants. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">In fact in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , when they spoke of merchants, they spoke of Canaanites. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">The Canaanite merchants, they used to come to <span class="DLF">temple grounds</span> and sell trinkets or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I am told there was a slogan, a motto that was displayed at the main <span class="DLF">road</span> leading to the <span class="BUILDING">school buildings</span> as you would approach the <span class="DLF">field</span> because we had a 50 acre <span class="DLF">farm</span> there and the name was, said in Hebrew . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">That means for us to return to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plow</span> as we have moved from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plow</span> to the scale, meaning to merchants. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Because the Jews were forced in medieval times and even in earlier times in exile, they forced out of so many avenues of life, they couldn’t own <span class="REGION">land</span> , so they wound up as businessmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">So the stereotype of a Jew as a businessman which emerged in Europe was not the true echoes of the Jewish people as it was then. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">At the time of Moses, that came not out of propensity of the people for that particular subject but because of necessity. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">So I felt that we are going to turn the clock of history and we will straighten this out and we will become farmers again. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Idealistic I was fired with enthusiasm, not on a single argument, but on all these that I have mentioned by others but that I cannot think of now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  So this reversal of medieval, social engineering so to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  Yeah, medieval, social engineering.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  I remember earlier you described the family reunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">The relatives from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and the differences in the way in which children behaved and also the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">What were the languages used in your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">ANSWER:  Well, my grandparents spoke to them in Yiddish because this was the language that was always used as a back up language. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Also used so that we wouldn’t understand it -- they wanted to say something to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">My parents were also fluent in Yiddish so that I think this 1s the language they used. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">They might have reverted to Polish because, still, my grandmother’s sister and her husband came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">They emigrated only after World War I there. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">They still remembered the language so they could speak Polish but their daughter, Jean, was a very beautiful girl -- she was actually my brother’s age. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I remember they went for a walk in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">They got lost and finally we got a call from the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> that they found them in the <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">They were lost and they came to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Someone from the adults took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> and brought them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">She couldn’t speak Polish but she knew a little Yiddish that she picked up from her parents and we just didn’t know -- we communicated by body language.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">QUESTION:  Which languages did you normally speak?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">ANSWER:  Polish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION:  Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I imagine you studied Hebrew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  Hebrew, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">QUESTION:  I remember a little bit of German earlier on. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Did you study German too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  I took German as my -- there was a choice given in <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , usually in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">It was either French or German. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">There was a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">That’s besides Hebrew and, of course, besides Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Sometimes they would give you an option of English. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">We didn’t have this option. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">But I learned English anyway through a tutor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  So your <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , would you describe it as being a Polish- speaking household?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">ANSWER:  Basically it was a Polish- speaking household.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">QUESTION:  That didn’t change your father underwent his ? </span><span class="sentence" id="279">A; This didn’t change.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">QUESTION:  Now, your uncles that we mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">They did not experience the same religious conversion that your father did:
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">QUESTION:  They continued to participate in the assimilated culture?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  We’ ve mentioned the <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Perhaps we should describe how the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was founded and by whom? </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I know the name of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was The I. Jacob Topas Store.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">But I think the founders of the whole Topas Enterprises were actually my grandfather, Jacob Topas and my grandmother Etta Sara Topas. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">It’s hard for me to determine after such a long time something that I was not private to, just exactly who had greater share in the dynamics of the expansion of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">But it started from a very modest beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Because after marriage, my grandmother tried to develop the talent that my grandfather possessed. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">He was a person who modeled ladies’ shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">He had a flair for this so she exploited him to the extent that she wanted to set up a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> that would manufacture handmade, custom-made shoes that would have his imprint on it, his model. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I think this is the way it originated. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">First, I think that they had a place on <span class="DLF">Pyskas Street</span> but by the time I was born they already had a flourishing <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we had also an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Later on they opened two more <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , one on Noves and one on Mar which was the main thoroughfare of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">But eventually, towards the time close before the outbreak of war, only the main <span class="BUILDING">store</span> remained functional. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Because they found out that they don’t need three <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , that people will come to this <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Because it was unique, because of the hand-made shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">This <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> catered to the intelligentsia and to the theater circles; people who could pay a good price for a good pair of shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">They were not inexpensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Then we also opened a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katovitz</span> before the outbreak of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">My father ran that for a while but the Polish government forced him out by saying that they are not going to allow anybody to set up a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> who was not a citizen as of 1920 or something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Some restrictive measure that were calculated against Jews, So we had to liquidate that <span class="BUILDING">store</span> also about six months before the outbreak of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">QUESTION:  That’s interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So the anti-Semitism of the Polish government was --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  Was also economic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  Economic, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And of course, there was no Polish state before 1918, 1919?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">ANSWER:  I really don’t know what they used as a cutoff date as to who 1s allowed to have a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> or not to have a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Because initially we had representation there, someone that had stores of shoes already and was just buying our shoes because there was a demand for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">The demand was so great that we decided, I mean my parents and grandparents, decided that perhaps they should open a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> there where they can also benefit from these sales to a greater extent than wholesaling it. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">So they went ahead and did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">But this didn’t sit well probably with the merchants -- shoe merchants in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and they put pressure on the officialdom to out stop us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">QUESTION:  Were there any other changes regarding your father’s companies’ business situation? </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I know there were other laws being introduced in the late thirties at this time regarding Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Did you know of any ---?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">ANSWER:  There is one event in the history of our business that I only know second hand from my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">He was closer to the center of action there than to know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">He claimed that the Polish government had a war debt. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I think probably 1920—1919, 1920, war with Russian Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">That the Jews were disproportionately, very heavily assessed to pay this. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">He told me that my grandfather, in the course of several years, had to pay something which would be in American pre-dollar value, a quarter of a million dollars but in Polish currency was close to a million zlotys which was a unit of Polish currency was defined. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">The ratio between one was like five zloty to a dollar.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">QUESTION:  Was there any chance that perhaps one of the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> was liquidated in order to help to pay this off?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">ANSWER:  This is quite conceivable. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">It might have been because I know that some real estate was sold in order to meet that --- those demands. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Because my grandparents owned <span class="REGION">land</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where we had our <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="329">End of Side A, Tape 1) I was mentioning the properties which my grandparents owned. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">They also, as I understand, had a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">This dates to the time that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was occupied; the occupation of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">They also had an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Danzig</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">But by the time I was born, all these properties were liquidated or sold, possibly to meet the demands of the Polish government. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">You know, the assessment as to how much of the debt is taxable to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="335"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> had a peculiar labor law. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">It permitted occupation strike which meant -- in actual experience this is what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Our shoes were hand made. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Most of the shoemakers which were employees were kind of the cottage-industry type meaning one who was the master craftsman employed journeymen and helpers, apprentices in his own <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">He would come to our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and get the materials and the models and so forth and he would bring the ready-made products and was paid for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">He was paid in advance and he was paid when he finished it. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">If there were some corrections to be made, he would have to do that too. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">So they were individual shoemakers, perhaps a hundred or so that were making the shoes for our company. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Now they became members of a union. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I remember distinctly that a few years before the war, there was a strike but they called it in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> an occupation strike, which meant that they were permitted to come into the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and occupy the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> that normally are reserved for the customers. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Bur the strike provided that they had to leave enough <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> so that business can continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Because I cannot conceive of a customer feeling comfortable in a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> where there is a hostile strike.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">QUESTION:  A labor conflict?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  Conflict, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">So I recall that strike and I remember an incident there that was largely discussed and talked about later. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">That one of the strikers, a heavy big guy, not only did he sit on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> but he stretched himself across several <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> to occupy. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">My father took him and forcibly threw him out the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">But the thing that struck me later is that I don’t recall that any of the non-Jewish firms were ever affected by such a strike. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">This strike was eventually resolved and everything then returned to normal, but it was one of those things that the Jews were not the first-class citizens in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">QUESTION:  Even if they were well off?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  Even if they were well off, I would imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Because a Jew always has to prove himself as a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">For instance, when the threat of war loomed against <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the Jews wanted to show their loyalty, especially against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> so there is in a book called Image Before My Eyes by Lucien Dobritsky, there is a photograph of a Jew donating actually a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military aircraft</span> to the Polish air force as a show of patriotism. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">But it didn’t help.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">QUESTION:  As if anyone could have suspected or expected Jews to be in favor of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in such a war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">ANSWER:  But they said -- the Polish parliament, which was only debating since the death of Puchentsky, was only debating I should say since 1935, was only debating the Jewish problem and attributed all the economic reverses or problems to the Jewish question of being a large majority there. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Although the largest majority were really Ukrainians, minority I mean.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">QUESTION:  Minorities, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">ANSWER:  Were Ukrainians. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">But this was most of -- the Jews disturbed them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">QUESTION:  So the Jewish problem was the greater one than the German problem?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">ANSWER:  Because they made it so. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">This was what was debated. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">When a Jewish member of their <span class="BUILDING">parliament</span> , their Same as they called it, came out and he said that we should confront; we should unite and should confront a common enemy; so the response was that these are two separate questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">That the Jewish question and the German question have nothing to do with the Jewish problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">That’s the way -- that was the answer
QUESTION:  The workers, the people who made the shoes, were they non-Jewish or Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">ANSWER:  Non-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">In that -- shoemakers were all non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Now there are people which are doing the tops and they were mostly Jewish because this is something that trade that falls within the sphere of Jewish interest for some reason or another.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">QUESTION:  The customers would be of all faiths?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">ANSWER:  Yes, very heavily Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Because the product was known and you still can find people today that are of my age who live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ; they all remember the <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Because it was a known firm, it was a known name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">QUESTION:  Now, 1938, which was the last year you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> before the war; that was also the year when the Germans were expelling Polish Jews back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Do you have any recollection of any of that? </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Did you witness any?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  Yes, we seen people with bundles that were sometimes seen on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">My father would point out to me and say these are refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Also we seen photographs in the newspaper, pictures in the newspaper of the rioting. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">The stories that were behind them; where they were stripped of German citizenship and the Polish government declared quickly that they stripped them also of the Polish citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So they were people without citizenship; it was very sad; it was a foretaste of things to come to an unimaginable proportion and degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">QUESTION:  Earlier we were talking about patriotism, the Polish patriotism of your father. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I recall when we were looking at the photographs, that you mentioned other family members who were involved in various patriotic efforts; either when <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was just becoming independent. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I’m referring to the war against the Soviet Union in 1920. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Then I remember too, there 1s someone who is in the Russian army at the time of the Russo-Japanese War?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="391"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , as you know, was occupied and didn’t regain its independence until 1918 and prior to this, it was partitioned and occupied by three major powers which was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , Austrian-Hungarian empire and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was mainly under the Russian influence and <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> , so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">The Russian government tried to -- they had a very strong intensive program of reciprocation, so the language in <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> was Russian and Russian was the language that you had to do business in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in official <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Also when people were drafted into the army, they went to the Imperial Russian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Now my grandfather, probably still a bachelor, was drafted into the Czar’s army and was sent to <span class="REGION">Manchuria</span> during the Russo- Japanese war. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I remember him telling me stories of how cheap life was, of how many times they executed Chinese. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">The Russians were executing Chinese and they were frightened of the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">The Russians might have cast the fear among the Chinese; they didn’t do so well with the Japanese because we know that the outcome of the war was not favorable to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">But he served with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I don’t know, I couldn’t tell you just how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I know he was with his friend who became his brother-in-law later because they married two sisters when they came back from the war, back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">My future grandfather, Jacob Topas married my grandmother Esther Topas. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">So this was one experience of the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I don’t think my grandfather volunteered but my father did volunteer to the militia as I mentioned before, during the Bolshevik invasion and was very patriotic that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">In fact my father served in the Polish army later on already because there was a conscription, also Metek served in the Polish army for a short period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">My father was a non-commissioned officer in the Polish army and after serving it, probably at a time when I was born, he also had to go periodically. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">He was recalled for maneuvers and for a few weeks of what they called exercises, military exercises. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">My father believed that we, the Jewish people, should be loyal regardless of anti-Semitism regardless of the inequities that existed in the social sphere of life, the economic discrimination-that we still owe allegiance to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that we live in. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">In that respect, there was no question about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">He was also a realist and he knew that we have to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because we are an endangered species there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  My recollection is that even your mother was involved -- in describing her experiences at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Warsaw</span> and then the tutoring work that she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">There was a document that you showed me earlier ---.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">That document showed that after graduating <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in 1918, 1919, she, during vacation time, did volunteer work in what they called <span class="BUILDING">Polish soldier home</span> , which is apparently, I would imagine it’s a convalescent home for soldiers that were injured in that 1919-1920 war. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">So she was briefly employed there or volunteered her services. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">She introduced that certificate and other certificates similar where she worked as a teacher in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> sort of to support her application for <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Warsaw University</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  This was in 1920 when she was helping, helping to care for the Polish soldiers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  Soldiers, I think so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">QUESTION:  Which would have been the middle of that war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">QUESTION:  Yet, one of your family members was considered not to be a citizen of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Or not a citizen of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> early enough? </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I remember when you were talking about your <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">This was not a citizen of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> but a citizen of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">This is kind of a discrimination, sort of <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> -- put in different <span class="INT_SPACE">compartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">You can be in this <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> but you cannot be in the other <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">What it meant is that our family opened a branch of our <span class="BUILDING">store</span> -- I think they opened it probably in 1938 ---. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">After six months of existence, the Polish government of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kapolt</span> ordered them out because they claimed that they were not citizens of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , or dwellers or residents of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> at some undetermined time which would otherwise by implication permit it. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Justify them being there, prusterick.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">QUESTION:  Of course, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katavista</span> was near the <span class="DLF">German frontier</span> and I imagine they were more paranoid than usual of all the border area.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">ANSWER:  I think that basically they couldn’t possibly -- they couldn’t question my father’s credentials since he was a reserve non-commissioned officer, volunteer in a war against <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">It was simply a question of economic discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">QUESTION:  Economic anti-Semitism regardless of patriotism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">QUESTION:  Now meanwhile you were off to the east, studying to be a farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I imagine you had mixed feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">You obviously liked being near animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">You wanted to be a farmer and yet you were far away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">You had left the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and now you’re in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sticks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">For <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that was the sticks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">ANSWER:  You’re going to make me say things which are in my book, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I am firm about that but you are very perceptive in understanding that someone who came from a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> suddenly changes his environment to a very raw surroundings 1n a sense -- that we had to haul our own water, even in our <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> and we were always exposed to the elements. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">The creature comforts that our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> provided were very remote there. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">It was not easy to get assimilated there. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I remember from the first class -- there were maybe thirty students that started the course. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">By the time of the fall harvest, of the potato harvest, 1t was reduced to about twenty. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Because the others quit, just packed up and went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because it was just too tough for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">But with me, it was very tough and I was always on the verge of quitting during the harvest. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">But I said -- I felt that it was an embarrassment to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and say that I failed. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">So I said, let me see if I can hold out at least another week because it doesn’t look good to come after the first week. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">So by several such resolutions, I extended my stay beyond the harvest time. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Eventually I got to like the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I took pride in being able to work there and being knowledgeable about crops and about animals and animal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Anything that relates to this type of life interested me. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I had a genuine interest 1n it that was developed by a very dynamic teacher and director of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , a fellow named Yachim Scholinsky who still lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">A very dynamic person who made study an excitement. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">He put excitement in it which you don’t normally find in <span class="BUILDING">classrooms</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">QUESTION:  Where were you when the war broke out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">ANSWER:  When the war broke out, I was in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">QUESTION:  Almost harvest time again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">ANSWER:  Well, it was past the harvest time because the war broke out on September 1, as you know, and the harvest usually starts in the middle of June and continues up to this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Hitler did very well by waiting for the Poles to gather for him, all the harvest and put them in <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> where they can easily have it picked up for their own use and for the army’s use, there was feeding off <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ,
QUESTION:  Were you surprised by the outbreak of war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">ANSWER:  Yes, I was surprised by the reality of 1t not about what you read in the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Because the movies and the papers, they create a different image and illusion of what things really are until you are really directly affected by them. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">The outbreak of the war was excitement and sort of loss of interest for school subjects. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> authorities suspended classes and they had dismissed all the students to go to their respective <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometowns</span> except for the contingent from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Because they said <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> is under bombardment and for our own safety, we will remain in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Because our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I think the war broke out on Friday morning, I think on Sunday our <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were already occupied by the Polish army because they were quartered there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION:  In what other ways does the war affect you? </span><span class="sentence" id="471"><span class="BUILDING">School</span> is closed, Polish army takes over the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> is besieged by German forces --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">ANSWER:  Not yet, at the very beginning, but it was under heavy pressure and bombardment because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> -- there was a mass bombing raid on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> before the war was declared. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">This was done on September 1“
QUESTION:  And those continued, the bombing attacks?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Sometimes I think, I don’t know if the war was declared, maybe at night or at 10 a.m. but it was already much later, hours already into the race where most of the Polish air force already was wiped out on the <span class="DLF">airfields</span> before they got up in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">So they definitely were taken by surprise -- those that shouldn’t have been taken by surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">We heard on the radio Friday morning at breakfast time, we heard about the attack on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and about the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Of course, there were mixed emotions. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">There was a lot of excitement but there was also great concern. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">What does it mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="481">What does it portend? </span><span class="sentence" id="482">But the authorities were very reassuring. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">They said the war will soon be over and everybody will go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I don’t know whether by this they meant that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> will win the war or there would be an armistice and the newscasters were very bombastic and enthusiastic in their reports. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Of course, we didn’t know, we didn’t have the idea, the ability to be critical. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">We had no critical ability to be able to sort of digest the essence and what truth is in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">You would hear -- a broadcaster would say like this : The Polish cavalry is fighting in <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span> like wild lions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">QUESTION:  You had never seen a wild lion before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">ANSWER:  But that was a kind of metaphor meaning that they are fierce fighters and also that they are -- the Polish army is advancing on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I mean this was like on the first or second day of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">When <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> joined the war on the third day and we could hear the English national anthem and the Marseilles played over the radio, there was literally -- the newspapers were hysterical. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">They felt that the war is going to be finished in a matter of -- 1n a short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Nobody really predicted any specific time but the feeling was that it was just a question of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">QUESTION:  That <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> would win?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">ANSWER:  That <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , together with <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> would win.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">QUESTION:  When did you realize that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> would win this one?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">ANSWER:  When they told me that -- and I was in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> -- that the Germans would be here in one hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">In a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> was under bombardment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">QUESTION:  It’s way to the east.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">ANSWER:  It’s past <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="501">QUESTION:  What about the Russian invasion? </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Did that come as a surprise?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">ANSWER:  It was anti-climatic but 1t came also as a surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Perhaps to many people it was a welcome surprise because out of the two evils, many people thought that if they went to the Russian zone- in the beginning it was very easy when they divide because the <span class="DLF">border</span> was not firm -- there was an influx of people both ways and they were not yet -- they didn’t have yet a strict instruction, how to handle the <span class="DLF">border</span> movement across the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">So that anybody that thought, believed that he was better off being on the Russian occupation than German -- a lot of people made that choice and then they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">They made a wise choice because they had a greater chance of survival in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> even those who were sent to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">They were displaced, they still had a better chance of survival because there was no deliberate effort by Stalin to destroy the people, no matter what nationality.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">QUESTION:  Unless they were Kolaks or or bourgeois or of production.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">ANSWER:  Or Polish officers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">That’s an interesting aspect of the Polish officers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katin</span> that many people don’t know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">A lot of Jewish officers were among these Polish officers and they were killed including the chief chaplain of the Polish army. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">The Jewish chaplain of the Polish army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">QUESTION:  What was your greatest priority in September 1939 as your world 1s falling around you? </span><span class="sentence" id="514">What is your --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">QUESTION:  To be reunited with my family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">QUESTION:  Reunited with your family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">QUESTION:  What is happening to your family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">ANSWER:  I didn’t really know what was happening to my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I could not establish contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I don’t know whether the <span class="DLF">telephone lines</span> were still functioning in the few days of the war but I know that I managed to send a telegram to my mother asking her to send me money for a ticket to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I don’t know whether she send me the money in time or whether the authorities gave us the money to buy the tickets because eventually they relented and they told us that we can return to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I think there were about five or six of us that immediately began to pack and go. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I remember a very interesting incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">When I was in the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> to send a telegram, there was a <span class="DLF">line</span> -- the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> also had the national savings bank of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> which was called PKO, -- that means Polish Fund of, Saving Fund, which was government fund and people were using savings books. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">So there were two Polish women standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> talking to each other and very patriotically that they still have confidence in the Polish government and that they are depositing. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">They were depositing,
QUESTION:  Eventually you do return to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">ANSWER:  I didn’t make it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I never made it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">The irony of it is and you can find it in my book that when I came to the cashier’s <span class="DLF">window</span> in with other students, I said <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">So she said the <span class="BUILDING">eastern railroad station</span> or the main? </span><span class="sentence" id="532">The eastern being on the east bank of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , the main being in the center of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I said, main. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">She said that will be 50 cents more or something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">QUESTION:  They charged you for it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">ANSWER:  I gladly paid for it because I had sufficient funds to pay for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">The irony of it was that we never got near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">QUESTION:  Well, you didn’t know it was surrounded, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Not only was it surrounded because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> traveled for about 40 or 50 kilometers and the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> were going skyward.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">QUESTION:  The aerial bombardment?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">There was no further railroad transportation --from there on, we were on foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">We never got any further than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="548">ANSWER:  What was not known to me and I found out later by miraculously meeting with my father in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> is that the Polish government -- there is a controversy about it by historians. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Some claim that the Germans, on Polish language gave the order in Polish to the Warsaw population that all able bodied men of military age should march east for mobilization where they going to make a defense deeper in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="550">This was given on the night, I think, of the sixth or seventh of September. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Then my father and his two brothers were of military age and the followed these orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">They marched east of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula River</span> and they marched east without any specific destination but they continued to march east where they were being strafed by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Stuka planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="553">But this order, a few hours later was countermanded. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I think the name of the officer that gave the order, countermanded it, was Romanowski. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">By that time, it was already too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Because I think the afterthought was they wanted to defend <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and all the manpower that would have done the defense left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">So my father and his two brothers were actually on the <span class="DLF">road</span> with thousands upon thousands of men and easy targets for the German Luftwaffe to strafe and to kill. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">The casualties were tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Eventually my father lost contact with his two brothers in the confusion that ensued and he got as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I found him on the evening of Rosh Hashanah, New Year’s, in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> where I went to pray. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I lived there too and I seen my father there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">QUESTION:  So it was a chance encounter?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">ANSWER:  Yes, it was unbelievable because there were thousands upon thousands of refugees that converged on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> and flooded the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> way beyond its normal population.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">QUESTION:  Were the rest of the family back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , were they affected at all by the bombardment? </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Were there any ---?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  Yes, the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that we lived in, the artillery destroyed part of the <span class="DLF">roof</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">One of the bombs struck the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and killed a couple of people who were in a <span class="DLF">doorway</span> , didn’t go to the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I was also told that there was a maid in our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , in one of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> that were in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> -- there was a <span class="BUILDING">drugstore</span> by the name of Prusak. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Prusak was a very nice man. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I think it was a <span class="BUILDING">family store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">He was the son of the owners and used to give candles and other things to kids when they came in with parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">He, somehow, got set on fire by a firebomb and became like a human torch and was burned alive during the bombardment. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">They had no water because all the facilities were disrupted so people literally had to travel to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula River</span> with buckets to bring water. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">The utilities were not restored until the Germans took the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> at the end of September.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">QUESTION:  So your brothers, your mother, your grandparents --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">ANSWER:  My grandfather, not grandparents because grandma left for <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> on the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> before the outbreak of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">QUESTION:  That’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">So grandpa is there and what was the plan? </span><span class="sentence" id="579">When your grandmother left to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , what was the plan?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">ANSWER:  The plan was that she is able to help us in some way. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Possibly to see if she can send us affidavits so we all can go. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Because she went on a tourist visa and ostensibly to see the World’s Fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">But in reality, she had a sister living there that visited us a few years earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">They were bakers here. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">So she went to see this sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">My father and the family here hoped that she would be able to help because by that time it was already too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">My grandmother was granted a visa and, of course, after obtaining the visa, she had to buy the ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">The name of the shipping company in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is called Orbees to this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">QUESTION:  The same company?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">ANSWER:  My father later told me that there was such a melee in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of wives of important Polish diplomats and government officials, they were asking to get a ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">They had no problems with visas and so forth but they were sold out. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">They would say that they would sleep on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> if there were no more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">You know, they couldn’t get it; they knew already what was coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">QUESTION:  This was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Puzutski</span> the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">ANSWER:  Yes, Puzutsk1.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">QUESTION:  Interesting that some of these people had less confidence in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ’s ability to withstand the German attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">You mentioned a family of diplomats and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="598">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="599">QUESTION:  So your grandmother was able to help you from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">ANSWER:  Yes, well this happened sometimes later. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">It was not-- after the order was restored in the occupied Poland and they allowed return to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ; we left probably already in October sometime, in later part of October; by horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> rather than by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">occupied Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">My father immediately proceeded, engaged people to repair the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , the <span class="DLF">roof</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and to restore 1t because otherwise we wouldn’t have shelter. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And it was actually in the later fall, perhaps in November of that year, we didn’t get packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">We got affidavits for the whole family to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">My father studied these affidavits and debated whether he should go to German authorities to obtain permission to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I don’t know what specific reasons were given but he never made use of these affidavits because the fear was that there were already some other people that have American relatives reported and they were imprisoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">This was very strange because American was not at war with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">So we never made use --—there was great excitement and expectation, the great expectation -- but it sort of was left in abeyance. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Bur later on, of course, we didn’t feel it so badly at that time but soon famine came and Russian and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And things got progressively well. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Then the packages began to come from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , from my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">She used to send an average of six packages a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">In the course of two days every member of the family would get a package.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">QUESTION:  And you would be able to correspond with her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">ANSWER:  We could correspond with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">The mail was going, it was censored, we had to be careful what we are saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">We couldn’t make any complaints. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">We understood this, that we have to be brief in expressing. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">We had to sort of let her read between the <span class="DLF">lines</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="620">QUESTION:  How long did these packages continue to come?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">ANSWER:  The packages came until the breakdown of the postal system in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> , meaning until the Germans put an end to it which was a few months before the deportation to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , the big action as they call it, the Grossactuen which would put it in May of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">The packages became sporadic, eventually there was a cut off point but they were our lifesavers because the famine in 1941 became very severe. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">If you read the notes, the Ringlem notes of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> , you'll find out that people were dying at the rate of 400, 500 a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">It was twice as much already in ’42. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">These packages were a thing that made a difference between us living or dying of hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Because we had no other resources that I knew of at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">We had some hidden shoes but it was very dangerous to sell them even in a clandestine fashion. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">The rations were not enough to sustain life. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">I remember during the time of famine in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> in 1941 that the children would just go in groups on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , after the curfew; I think the curfew was 8 p.m. But it was not dark yet during the summer months so they would walk on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> barefoot with the swollen legs and beg for alms and beg for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">One of the standard <span class="DLF">lines</span> they would say, Yan which means I don’t want to surrender my ration card. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Surrender meaning dying, so they were begging for bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">My parents would always do something, however inconsequential this would have been to withstand this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">QUESTION:  What did your grandmother send?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">ANSWER:  The packages that we would get, I have a feeling, were not something that she, herself, prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">There must have been an agency that handled and she just paid them for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">But it had canned goods like sardines, it had coconut butter, a can of coconut butter which was very useful because my brother, my youngest brother Meir, had a touch of tuberculosis and he was spitting with blood so he needed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">They would send us Salem Lipton Tea, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Lipton Tea was worth its weight in gold because you could get -- coffee and tea was at a premium, above other commodities except maybe for bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">So some of these things we used and some of them were sold in order to buy bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">QUESTION:  So she helped feed you and she essentially gave you the wherewithal to supplement?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">ANSWER:  She gave us a lease on life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And everyone received a package?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">ANSWER:  Well, everyone received a package by families.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="645">QUESTION:  Who would she address it to? </span><span class="sentence" id="646">To your -----?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">ANSWER:  Different names of our family members. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">But we understood who was -- it was for Shimatopas, it meant it was for our family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">QUESTION:  For everyone, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">What happened to the <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> under the occupation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">ANSWER:  Well, in 1939 I believe, in November, late October or November, the Germans had arrived and confiscated all the shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">It was quite -- the <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> was closed already and they came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I remember when they were standing; they rang the bell in my grandfather’s <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which was one flight above the <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> in the same <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="654">It was a four-story <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> with a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> in the center and <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> surrounding it. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">I remember the chief gendarme said, Is das de grochen ? , </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Isaac Yacob Topas? </span><span class="sentence" id="657">So when it was answered in the affirmative, then they graciously told him that he could keep something like 20 or 30 pair of shoes, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">They gave him a receipt for it and they said the rest will be confiscated and he will have to help to load up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">He and my father and people that were caught on the <span class="DLF">street</span> to help out with this, so there was kind of a, like a bucket brigade carrying the shoes to those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> that were being loaded.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">QUESTION:  Do you remember when this was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">ANSWER:  I would have to look in my book for exact date but it was either in -- the closest I can think, November, more likely November 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">QUESTION:  So the Germans knew who your grandfather was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="663">ANSWER:  Well, they had information about <span class="BUILDING">shoe stores</span> and businesses and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">QUESTION:  I was trying to imagine when we were talking about the affidavits earlier, the reasons why he wouldn’t pursue that and I thought to myself, well perhaps he didn’t want to call attention to himself, especially since other people were being arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">---presenting yourselves to the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">ANSWER:  Well, I have a feeling, because this happened later, even more so. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">That anyone, this was probably among the Jews more prevailing this, that reported to the German authorities and showed they had affidavits and wanted to leave for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , the Germans could let them go, they could tell them to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , or they could put them in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="668">We knew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poviac</span> which was the most wholesome <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> that they had some Jewish families that had American --. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">We didn’t even want to let them know that we had American relationships although the packages would have indicated this. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">But they didn’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Food packages 1s this kind of thing, that it doesn’t have any political significance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="672">QUESTION:  But it’s curious that the Germans were consciously trying to starve the ghetto of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and yet they allowed the food packages to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="673">ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Because it was a drop in the bucket. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Maybe they would feel differently if it was a real organized Jewish effort in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to send packages by the thousands to cover most of the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Then they would say that it would be counter to their policy of starvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">In fact, my grandmother’s sister with whom she lodged at the beginning after she arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , there was a limit on what she could take. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">She couldn’t take currency, just a few hundred dollars, from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> when she came over to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">But she had some jewelry and she was using that to cash in the jewelry to send us these packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">But that was not enough and she had to go and sought a job and found -- became a nurse, kind of a live-in nurse with a paralyzed woman so the income from this, from working as a nurse, she would use to send us these packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">She is a big heroine in our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">She did this and her sister, I found out when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , was trying to dissuade her and would say, Itala, that was her name she was called by. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">What are you doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="684">What are you knocking yourself out? </span><span class="sentence" id="685">They are not going to get these packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">The Germans are going to confiscate all these packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Therefore you are doing it in vain. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">My grandmother, and this was a very persuasive argument because it is always easier not to do something than to do something, kind of a law of gravity, if she listened to her, we would have perished sooner. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I probably wouldn’t get the point where I can start my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> career.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">QUESTION:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">ANSWER:  I wouldn’t get that far.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">QUESTION:  You may not have survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> either. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">I mean there were all kinds of ways of not surviving.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="694">ANSWER:  Absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">QUESTION:  Do you recall any other -- I can remember you had an introduction to farming and no doubt you were able to put some of that training to use in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  Well, the training of the farming stood me well in several ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">First of all in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , it was a bodybuilding process. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">The hard work. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I became, I was what you call a strong fellow, a young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Secondly, it gave me the knowledge of agriculture and ability to work on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> there was an organization called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toporol</span> , T-o-p-o-r-o-l, which stood for , Means a society supporting agricultural work. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">That opened courses in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> for people interested in this and I took those courses. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">This way I became affiliated with this organization. (</span><span class="sentence" id="704">End of Tape 1.) </span><span class="sentence" id="705">In the summer of 1941, perhaps even in the late spring of 1941, the Toporol organization, that organization that was dedicated to the agricultural work, sees an opportunity of utilizing all empty and vacant lots of <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> or just squares -- to utilize them in growing vegetables for the starving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Of course, it was a puny effort in comparison to the need where you have half a million people, nearly half a million people, starving in the <span class="DLF">walls</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">But nevertheless, the effort was necessary even if the produce that came from all this work was distributed to the students that were working on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Because it was not that much that they could- it would be very difficult for them anyhow to get it past that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I was at a time, already sixteen years old and I was made, appointed, one of the instructors. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">I remember there was a large plot, <span class="DLF">yard</span> in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , <span class="DLF">Leshner Street</span> , not far from where we lived where I had two groups of students that were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">One for two hours and then the next one for two hours and I was showing them how -- we were working those lots and I was showing them how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">They were very eager kids, even some of them were, of course, undernourished. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">They were very enthusiastically interested in the work and doing this work. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">In fact, one of the girls that was in the group, not in my group but in the group of another instructor who was sick and I was sent there as a replacement one time to fill in, remembered me long after the war and sent me a letter to this effect, which became an appendix to my book. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">She is trying to find out whether I am the same person who acted as an instructor at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">These kids were very eager and we were planting lettuce, radishes, tomatoes, I remember, cabbage, very basic things in a kind of garden farming or tract farming as they call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I was also assigned on a <span class="BUILDING">Gensha Street prison</span> and I also remember working at a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> on <span class="DLF">Gensha Street</span> and there was a very stark contrast between what we were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">We were pruning tomato plants for the living, while perhaps a 100 feet from us or less, there were people being buried in <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Usually the method that was used, they were using a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chute</span> from the back of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">a wagon</span> into those <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">The work was going on all day. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Those people were being -- the dead were being collected. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">By that time the famine was very severe. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I was occupied with this job, which sometimes the reward was to the students and the instructors that they could pick up some of the crops of their own handiwork, own labor and I think that the instructors were also getting, weekly, a loaf of bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">QUESTION:  Were you an instructor as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">ANSWER:  Yeah, I was an instructor. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">That was what we were getting above the students, the people that were coming in these groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">In the end of June of the same summer, a call went out from this organization for able bodied men, whom they have on their roster already, to report for volunteer work in the states around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin district</span> to help with the harvest. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">My parents very quickly consented to me to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">They would have one less mouth to feed and the conditions in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> were very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">By that time, my brother Szymon also already had a touch of tuberculosis. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">He was spitting blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">This is even with the help of the packages we were getting from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="733">It was just not enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">We were shipped to the district of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> and we worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">We were quartered there and worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Even after the harvest I managed to stay there until February of the following year. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">This was a very significant factor in my own personal survival from the standpoint that I was able to eat normally during that period of time and live in a healthy environment of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , quite a contrast. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">In fact after I had been a month on those <span class="DLF">estates</span> , I thought to bring my brother Szymon there, somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">There was a small <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> and I managed to make a phone call to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> that was opposite to our <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">My father came to the phone and I told him about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">He said that my brother Szymon didn’t look like a Jew and he could pass for an Aryan easily -- that he should come and join me, that he should send him out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="742">He came and he stayed for a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Of course there was a problem there. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">He got homesick and eventually he left and went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">QUESTION:  Because he was homesick?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="746">ANSWER:  Yes, because he was homesick. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">But I did not go until it was absolutely -- I found out that it was dangerous to live there because we no longer, we were no longer needed there for the harvest in February, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="748">So in February, I returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">We were almost shot in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denblin</span> en route by the German authorities who did not recognize our pass or came within seconds of not telling you this whole story. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">There were many such incidents because I was also involved in smuggling and I cannot go into this. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">There was just too many schemes and escapes and whatnot. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I returned to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in February, found out that my grandfather, Jacob Topas, the founder died a few months earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">QUESTION:  In January?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="754">ANSWER:  From typhus epidemic that was raging in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> from famine because the sanitary conditions were very poor at the time and the overcrowding brought in lice and lice begot typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">So you had everything together. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">But apparently all these things that the Germans put in operation to strangulate the economic life of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> and to bring the demise of the Jews, didn’t happen for them fast enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">So the inevitable thing is that they had to resort to a more drastic method of bringing about the end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="758">In April of 1942, a reign of terror started in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="759">We began to talk about <span class="BUILDING">building shelters</span> ; something was impending, we didn’t know exactly what. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">The packages from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> stopped coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I forgot to mention that when <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> entered the war, my grandmother resorted to ---. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">She was very resourceful, she contacted someone in the <span class="BUILDING">Portuguese embassy</span> or <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> and the packages were coming -- the point of origin was <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="763"><span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> was neutral so we were getting packages probably until spring of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">Then the whole postal system, the whole ghetto system began to break down. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">The Germans, as I mentioned to you, launched a reign of terror in April of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">They kept it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Later on I learned that this reign of terror was to paralyze the will of the people to resist for what was coming., </span><span class="sentence" id="768">for what they had in store for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">That was the “resettlement” action. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Resettlement meant shipment to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="771">It started by them posting the declarations or the ordinance that the Jews should report voluntarily to the <span class="DLF">umschlagplatz</span> , the <span class="DLF">umschlagplatz</span> being the <span class="BUILDING">depot</span> from which the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were leaving for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> .. They would go east, they would obtain shelter. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Those who report voluntarily would receive jam and bread and surprisingly enough, the first day, which was July 22" and this happened to be Tish a’Bov, the day of mourning for the Jews for the two destructions of the First and Second Temple in 586 B.C. and 70 A.D. by Babylonians and Romans, respectively; so the Germans launched this action. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">The key ingredient in carrying it out was deception. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Deception being that the Jews were promised to go to the east where there’s work, shelter for them and they imagined that nothing could be worse than the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> so the poorest of the poor began to report to the <span class="DLF">umschlagplatz</span> with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> ,. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">The Germans tolerated it. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">The first shipment, the people received the bread, they received the jam, they were able to take their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> and they were put in the box cats and shipped away. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">But within 24 hours, rumors spread as a wildfire, that someone escaped from this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> is really an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I remember that evening when we heard it in our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> ---.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="779">QUESTION:  So already in July of ’42 ---?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="780">ANSWER:  Yes, I think within a day or two we already knew what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Many people didn’t want to believe it, we believed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">In these circumstances-- by that time my brother and I were already in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luftwaffe camp</span> , my brother Szymon. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">In other words, he -- we both report as volunteers to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luftwaffe camp</span> yet before this action was launched. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">This was kind if a transition from the agricultural work into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luftwaffe camp</span> and this was a forced labor column. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">We were not quartered there; we were still living with our family and were just coming to a point at the <span class="DLF">Warsaw Ghetto gate</span> where two Luftwaffe guards would take us to our job. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Sometimes they used <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcars</span> for part of the trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">There was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bilanie</span> ; there was a big storage of Luftwaffe equipment, paints, and maintenance things for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> when we were supposed to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">But initially they got us cleaning bricks in bombed-out <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="789">I don’t know why but I said to myself, we are back in the <span class="DLF">brickfields</span> , we are back in the <span class="DLF">brickfields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Symbolically we were reduced to the status of our ancestors in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">But this still was, comparatively, benign to what was in store for us in this forced labor column. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">When the action was launched, as I mentioned before, on the second and third day, there were no volunteers to go to the <span class="DLF">umschlagplatz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">So the Germans began isolating and putting a dragnet on certain sections of -- block by block of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and emptied the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="794">They also would come in, when the Germans came to conduct this with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , sometimes, they usually marched people, those that could march. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">Those who were already immobile, they were handicapped or they were so starved that they couldn’t walk, they threw them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and they took them that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">They could come in and announce that they would respect all the passes because the people were working for German industry; they were working maybe for the ghetto government, like the Judenrat; they were working for the city ornundines which was the police; maybe they were working for the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ; they would be all exempt. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">So they were ---.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="798">QUESTION:  They would respect these passes in the east after resettlement?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="799">ANSWER:  They had an assorted degree of authority that in the beginning, they respected them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">As the time went on, they were less and less respected. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">I didn’t have any pass so that if I was caught, I probably would have been shipped out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> too because we were simply assembling every morning before the action started, however, early in the morning to go out and were brought at the end of the day, to the point, to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and then we were on our own to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .. But after this action went into effect and was already in effect for a week or two, once we came to work, the captain said when you come tomorrow to work, bring your things with you because you’re going to be here, interned for your own protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Then he looked at the faces; he passed all of us in review. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">The whole group of about two hundred people. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">He looked at my brother and he said he cannot come tomorrow, he’s too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">He also, maybe, exempted another kid and that was the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">When we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was in such a state of terror besides this, that the German SS men were riding in rickshaws. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">You know what the rickshaws were? </span><span class="sentence" id="808">They were those bicycle-pedaled three-wheelers where the passengers are sitting in the front and the bicycle-peddler in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">They would ride in the bicycle-pedaled <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rickshaw</span> and they would be firing at the <span class="DLF">windows</span> at the people and the crowds wherever they see them.. So we were literally dodging bullets when we were coming back from our work. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">Of course, after that incident, after we were told that we’re going to be interned there, I realized that I’m going to have to part from my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">The morning after this, when I got up in the morning, my father was still praying. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">I said goodbye to my mother and she was packing some of my things that I was going to take with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">I said goodbye to my sweet brother Meir, my youngest brother, Meir, and to Szymon. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Then my father gave me a blessing; it was the first time I’d seen him cry in my life because he was a very steady influence. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">He was a very self- possessed individual and confident that somehow we’re going to get through this whole ordeal and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I don’t know what was going on in his mind but if I did not realize it, he must have realized that we are parting for good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="817">QUESTION:  You didn’t realize it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="818">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">I was too much of an optimist. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">I was too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">I’m sort of a romantic in a sense that I think that hope can overcome reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="822">QUESTION:  And you had managed to come back before. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I imagine that you had a feeling that somehow you could manage. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> the first time, and then coming -- I imagine each time you walked back from work, there was sort of a feeling of survival, giving the random violence that was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="825">ANSWER:  Correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">I also had faith that evil cannot vanquish good. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">So in the long run, I don’t think that there was any doubt even by those who perished that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> will be defeated and that they’re going to win the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">The question is when. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">But there was no doubt that Hitler will lose that war and that the Allies will prevail and win. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">But meanwhile, we were in their grasp so such optimism has a limited value and effect on your well-being. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Of course when I took my last glance at my father, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">I haven’t seen him again nor my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I went to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="834">We learned that in October, Yom Kippur, the Day of Judgment, was the last day of the shipments to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="835">In fact, the Jewish police had the honor of being put in the last transport to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> because they were promised that if they cooperate in the round-up of the Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> , that they and their families would be spared. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">So they and their families on the Judgment Day were spared until that point but then they were also shipped. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">I guess there was some poetic justice in that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="838">QUESTION:  Symbolism at least.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="839">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">I began to realize that if I wanted to know what happened to my parents and to my family, I would have to return t the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="841">But you just simply cannot say I am leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">We were by that time already interned, we were prisoners, we were not free people. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Although there was such a nebulous air about it as to exactly what is our status there. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">We worked there; they intern us for our own protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">That means if we leave, we are just taking risk with the protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">But, in reality, you could be shot for leaving without permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">I began to plan an escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">The way I went about it, I reported that I am a shoemaker by trade and that we have people here whose shoes need repair. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">If they are going to continue to work, someone has to repair their shoes, that I should be given the opportunity to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">In order to do this, I need tools and equipment and I can get these in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="851">So they send me with a guard to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="852">On the second such trip, I escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">I left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">Then I began to -- I had to go where our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">By that time, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was reduced in size. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">There was what they call Niemand’s Land that means Nobody’s Land and it was not permitted to be there but there was a group that the SS employed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> of Jews which was called Vertafastak. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">Vertafastak was sort of a clean up group that was confiscating all the -- collecting all the goods of the people that were no longer there. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Furniture, books, belongings, clothes, whatever else those that were deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">It was a big operation and a large contingent of these who were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">They would be doing it by <span class="DLF">streets</span> .. I reported to work with such a group and when they went there, I separated myself from them by just ---. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">There were so many people walking upstairs and downstairs and there were only a couple of guards usually at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="862">I went on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> and through the <span class="DLF">roof</span> I walked to the <span class="DLF">roof</span> of the adjacent <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , came down and eventually got to the area of my own <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which, of course was deserted. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">But I found out that behind <span class="DLF">iron doors</span> , <span class="DLF">back doors</span> of one of the <span class="BUILDING">delicatessen stores</span> , which really delicatessen in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> means something else, means like a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="864">I found out that the survivors there who knew me and who were tenants in our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , that my mother perished, that she was one of the first -- in one of the early raids -- and they told me that my father might still be around but they don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">Eventually I met in this Niemand’s Land another person who had a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> also in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="866">His name was Bart and he told me to look; he told me that there is reason my father and my brother survived in there someplace, perhaps in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Without going into much detail, I never found out anything more beyond that except returning once with the group I found that my Uncle Melek survived and he’s now in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="868">I went to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">He, in turn, told me that my grandmother, my maternal grandmother survived by hiding herself in a clothes chest and her sisters, three sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="870">QUESTION:  These are your mother’s sisters from Plutz who were moved to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="900">ANSWER:  By the Luftwaffe. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">We were working at the <span class="DLF">airfield</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="902">There was a Yunkirst enterprise, a dismantling division of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> , shot down <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fighter planes</span> over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that was brought in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">This is how the weapons got sometimes in the hands of the fighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">They were found in these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="905">I think on May 12", we were being, we were sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> under guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">At that time, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> was already in ruins but the fight was still going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">We were taken to the <span class="DLF">umschlagplatz</span> and shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">I didn’t know about it but we found out we were shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> , we decided not to jump the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , not to make any efforts, because we knew we were on a <span class="DLF">line</span> that was not going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> ; we established that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">But it turned out to be that we were slated to go to <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> , also there were <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="931">QUESTION:  Is this the same group of 88.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="932">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">The 88 had nothing to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">There was a registry because we were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budzyn</span> 
QUESTION:  This is when you became a chemist? </span><span class="sentence" id="935">You were in another group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="936">ANSWER:  There was another group because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had over 2,000 people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budzyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="937">This group was only maybe 50, 60 people large and it was an aggregate of people from different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="938"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budzyn</span> had a contingent in it; <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plaszow</span> picked up a few people. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">But eventually we were being set up in a sort of <span class="BUILDING">lab</span> to work in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="940">That’s where the real work went in. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">It was an unbelievable experience because I learned English working in this <span class="BUILDING">lab</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="942">There was nothing really for me to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">I found an English textbook and David Copperfield and I learned English, found a tutor as well, among the prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="944">QUESTION:  A Jewish inmate?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="945">ANSWER:  Yes, named Goldfarb who was teaching me grammar. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">But there was a group of prisoners who was actually working on plans for this device, as the Germans called apparatus. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">There were some rumors as to what it could do if it were successful in doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">It fell into the realm of the semi-fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">I spoke once to my uncle who was a chemist, about it, and he says that what they propose to do could not be achieved. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">It was unobtainable but they thought it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">The Germans were not fools; they apparently were convinced that something could be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">This project was not such a local thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">We didn’t know about it at the time but it claimed the interest of the highest echelon of Nazi power. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">I have a telegram that came after my book went to print, which is addressed to Himmler to grant permission to move this group, which 1s essential to the war effort, this is German’s writing, a Jewish group essential to the war effort . </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Do you see the paradox in this? </span><span class="sentence" id="956">If we help them win the war, they’re going to exterminate all the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">To the war effort and I have a reply from <span class="BUILDING">Himmler’s office</span> , from <span class="BUILDING">Himmler’s headquarters</span> , that he grants permission and that the matter should be taken up with so-and-so to transfer the Jews, the scientists. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">So we’re working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">Eventually, when this project did not produce a mousetrap, it was disbanded and it was just a few weeks later that the Allies armies were already close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="960">I don’t know how close they were because I was on a death march for about three, close to four days. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">We were liberated in April by the 11 Armored Division and of course, then I realized what happened to the other members of my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">I knew already in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> , from my Uncle Melek, whom I found after I came from The Orcencia; I met him after the Orcencia place, I was in his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="963">He told me that Uncle Ben is hiding on the Aryan side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> and that Rose, his wife, has Aryan papers, works for German industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">She hides him in her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="965">I found out that possibly that my Uncle Sevek, the orphan --cousin who lived -- one of the three orphans brought up in my grandparents’ <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , is also some <span class="NPIP">place</span> in hiding but he didn’t know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">He didn’t know whether he is still in hiding or whether he perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">But beyond that all contact was lost and I have not learned of any details of any of my relatives except that I found out that my father, through Tracing Bureau, they send me this document that I showed you just when you first came in -- that attested to the fact that my father lost his life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> on September 23, 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">So my mother died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> in the first action, 1942, probably in August with my brother Meir. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">Now the only person that I don’t have a definite proof that was killed is my brother Szymon, to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">Because all other perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">My grandmother, who saved herself from the first round-up in 1942, was probably shipped out in 1943 if she didn’t perish sooner, with her daughters, my aunts and with these two boys of the eldest daughter, Frania.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1061">ANSWER:  To see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> -- and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sevek</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">We went together to visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">Now when we visit <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , we realize that we are going to be there only six days or seven days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">Our time was of essence there, so we preplanned exactly what we are going to ---. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1065">End of Side A, Tape 11) We arranged for two chauffeurs and two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">limos</span> , two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> to take us around so we don’t depend on the regular tourist conveyance top see the <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">Because there were specific <span class="NPIP">places</span> that the itinerary for our visit to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was planned in advance and it was very compact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">We had to crowd many things into a very short <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> -- so that when we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , we had two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">limos</span> already when we arrived at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> to pick us up, to take us to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and the following morning, we started our visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">Of course my visit included first of all the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> itself, the ghetto monument, the site of our <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> , which <span class="BUILDING">building</span> had been erased, had been destroyed during the uprising or possibly after the uprising, perhaps in the Polish revolt which was in 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">It included visits to my childhood place of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shaboruf</span> where I -- to remember the <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> that belonged to my grandparents, perhaps still does, where we spent summers in my childhood days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">Then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> , we visit in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin district</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">I see also the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> which I had memory because I knew a family there and a girl that perished in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">Then we went to places of that was of interest to my friend Mark. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">We went, I think that this 1s what we did in the course of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">We still had <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , increments of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> that were to be seen, for instance, the <span class="DLF">Warsaw cemetery</span> that we didn‘t have time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">I don’t know on which day but I think on one day, perhaps it was Sunday, the following Sunday of our arrival, that we decided to split because Mark had his own itinerary with his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> and I wanted to see my mother’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plutz</span> and we have seen what there was to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">The <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was destroyed but the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">I seen my grandparents’ <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , which was very, very small and --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1079">QUESTION:  The opposite of luxurious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1080">ANSWER:  Of what we were used to in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">After seeing all these <span class="NPIP">places</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula River</span> and whatever I could associate with the past, we went to see.. Then we had a very intelligent driver and driving back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> I realized that in spite of our frugality in using time economically, in disposing of time, we were coming early. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">I said to myself, I looked at my watch and I think it was something like 4:30 p.m. and the days in late August were very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">I said to the driver, I said, do we have time to see another <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the vicinity of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">Which really was not on schedule. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">But it suddenly occurred to me that the last three summers, we did not go to our <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shorboruf</span> , but we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oralie</span> a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oralie</span> which was kind of a <span class="BUILDING">summer resort</span> and also a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">farming community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">I was there in the summer of ’37 and ’38 and my family was there also in the summer of ’39. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">Because in ’38 in the middle of the summer, I was sent to the <span class="BUILDING">agricultural school</span> as you recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">I said, it would be interesting to see because I would be able to see the very <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> where we stayed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">I asked my wife and she consented and the driver said, by all means, he was gung-ho. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">We directed because it was in the vicinity of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , it would not take us more than maybe half an hour out of the way, counting both ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">We had some difficulty finding our way to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to recognize and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">Finally, some people told me which <span class="BUILDING">building</span> it is that I probably was in that summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">I came by that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and I look at that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and I say, no this is not the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , it doesn’t have <span class="DLF">veranda</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">We turn around and went back to the beginning of the <span class="DLF">street</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> when one of the properties -- a woman, elderly lady told us that this is the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">I say this is not the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">She says this is the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">I spoke to her in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">She says this is the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , she insisted, persisted rather. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">I said, where’s the <span class="DLF">veranda</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">She says it was removed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">That can confuse you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1102">QUESTION:  So you were both right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1103">ANSWER:  I asked her and she took us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">It turned out to be she was a sister-in-law of the landlady of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> named Levandofska. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">Mr. Levandofsky was, of course, the landlord. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">When I was there, she was a woman in her twenties. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">Now she was nearly 80 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">She was sitting there; 1t looked like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rocking chair</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">The lady that brought us in said you have guests in here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">The guests being my wife, the driver and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">We came in, we looked at her, and I began to orient myself there that this is the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in which we stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">This was a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that -- there were three families in the summer that shared that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">I’m repeating something that you can find in my book but I can probably tell you this in a greater detail than you will find in my book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">I say Mrs. Levandofska; she didn’t know who I was but they knew that we are tourists and that we were probably from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and I spoke Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">Many Poles returned back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">I said to her, do you remember who lived in this -- who was vacationing here in the summer, who occupied this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in the summer of 1938, ’39? </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">She looked and just stared at me without saying anything like gathering her thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">Of course, I couldn’t figure what were her thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">I went one step further and I said, do you remember who was in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">Pointing to one of the <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">She said Lasolta. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">I said it was a Polish pilot, the family who lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">So she says Lasolta. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">She remembered that name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">I pointed to another <span class="DLF">door</span> and she mentioned the other family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">Then I didn’t say anything for a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">Then I said, wasn’t a Jewish family here also in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> here? </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">Pointing to the last one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">She says, yes, Topas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">She said, Mr. Topas, very sympathetic man, and Mrs. Topas, very nice lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">And they had two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">The oldest was Yurik and the younger was Szymon, another baby too? </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">Oh yeah, Meirick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">That’s Meir. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">She told them that my father was very good to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">He brought gifts, shoes for the family in addition to whatever they paid for the rent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">She volunteered a few things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">I said to her I was very pleased. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">We took some photographs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">I thought the audience was over and I already exchanged some dollars for Polish money which power of dollars was tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">I was going to give her a few thousand of the Polish zloty which were not very much in American money but I felt that I took her time and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">I felt that I would do it just as a friendly gesture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">But just about when I thought that the whole interview was over, she began to shake in her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">She says, Szymonik, such a well-built boy, a pleasant boy, didn’t look Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">He came here from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> in the summer of 1942, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">He asked me to save him, to shelter him, to hide him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">I wanted to do it, I really wanted to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">But we were afraid because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were going from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> on the <span class="DLF">track</span> that was stopping in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ourland</span> during the normal rides and the Jews were jumping off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">There was a gendarme named Stein who was looking for them here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">I was afraid that if I’m going to hide him, the neighbors will snitch on me and then we’re all going to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">So I said to Szymonik, let my husband take you to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">Maybe you can be a shepherd there to cows, that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">Szymon, my brother, at that time was about fourteen years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">But he didn’t want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">He says he doesn’t know there anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">But, and she repeated it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">He told me that his grandmother lives in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , is in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">I immediately presumed that he said that to make her understand that if she does this, if she takes the risk, that she would be rewarded for it, after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">I ask her, Mrs. Levandoska, then what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">Did he leave? </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">She said, well maybe he stayed here a day or two, a few days and then he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">I said did you hear anything about him? </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">She said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">I had right away a premonition that he must have perished not far from this point because he came in and although he didn’t look Jewish, but he was a kid and he was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">You realize that every Jew just by virtue of being Jewish, had a price tag on his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1166">QUESTION:  And he was in an <span class="REGION">area</span> where they were hunting for Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1167">ANSWER:  And a Polish peasant who turned in a Jew could get a bottle of vodka and two pounds of sugar and maybe a hundred zlotys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">So there was a reward, just as there was punishment for hiding the Jews, there was a reward for turning them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">He might have been turned in by Polish people; he might have made it back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">When she came to the end, she was very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">She realized that I’m a relative but she didn’t know who I was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1173">QUESTION:  She still didn’t know who you are?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1174">ANSWER:  I told her that I’m Yurik, that I survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">I joined the American army, fought to the war’s end, and came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">My grandmother lived in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> at the time, until 1969, when she died here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lakewood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">She’s buried in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lakewood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">But I still gave her the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">She didn’t want to accept the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">Why are you giving money? </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">I didn’t save your brother, she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">Oh well, you wanted to save him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">Then it seemed like there was nothing more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">I was pretty -- right now I can speak about it without being as shaken up as I was at the time when it happened and when I repeated it the first time or two, but now it’s in the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">Then I said -- I just thought for a moment -- I said do you have any photographs of before the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">So they brought in an album of photographs before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">I scanned through the photographs and seen the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , I seen Mr. Landofsky who, incidentally, was laying paralyzed from the waist down in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> next door in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where we were talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">I didn’t see anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">I was hoping that maybe they photographed our family, which for me, would have been priceless but they didn’t have any. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">There were some loose photographs that were just bunched up in the bottom of- the end of the album. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">I went through these photographs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">I found a photograph of Adolph Hitler..
QUESTION:  That tells you something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1193">ANSWER:  It was really confusing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1194">QUESTION:  Was there any writing on it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1195">ANSWER:  No writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">It was just like a post card, a picture of Adolph Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">The driver had seen this with me and I just didn’t say anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">I just shut and closed the album and we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">When we get in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , I was confused but I realized that her husband must have been a Hitler sympathizer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">That she might have, I feel that she was an earnest person, an earnest woman because she didn’t have to tell me anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">She didn’t have to tell me that he came back there to save her, that he came from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> , had to risk his life and get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">Came to her and asked her to be kept in there . </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">She didn’t have to volunteer any of that; I didn’t ask her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">She did tell me this so she -- maybe she had good intentions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">She wanted to save him but maybe her husband was opposed to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">He might have been an admirer of Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1207">QUESTION:  Or even if he weren’t, he could have opposed it for other reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1208">ANSWER:  They had reasons but what shall I say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1209">QUESTION:  It’s hard to imagine a real Pole being an admirer of Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1210">ANSWER:  Well there was admiration for ---. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">Until Hitler turning on to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">There was a tremendous admiration for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because of their policy towards the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1213">QUESTION:  Considering what they were doing to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , that would not have been very patriotic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1214">ANSWER:  Yes, it would not be patriotic and perhaps it is to their credit, of the Poles, that they didn’t have many collaborators against their own people that we know of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">They didn’t have many collaborators towards their own people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">But many among them were very vicious anti-Semites and we were talking about all these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">I didn’t mention to you, the Rosenbaums who are in my book, a beautiful girl -- and her mother were hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">They were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">I met them -- I got to know them during the war in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> when I was staying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">My father was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">You remember when I told you we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">Later on I got a post card that she is hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">I told you I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> when they went into hiding on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> by a fellow named Sty in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sm</span> , Ko in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">It was not until maybe five years ago that a widow of the son of the owner, who told me that both women were killed by people other than the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">She didn’t say so but she says they were killed because of their possessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">They went out in the middle of the night with valises having their valuables with them, no doubt, and he says, you know that there was no shortage of vile people during the war and they were shot and buried in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">This is something I have to return to because I didn’t have a chance to visit Sm where possibly the <span class="DLF">burial ground</span> is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">I don’t think that the <span class="DLF">grave</span> was marked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">But this is where they were shot and they were shot by Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">My brother Szymon, is still an enigma even in spite of any premonition I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">There was an interesting development that is almost anti-climatic to everything we are talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">My wife, first, and then my son visiting <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> went to a <span class="DLF">cavern</span> which is on the border of <span class="COUNTRY">Lebanon</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">The <span class="DLF">cavern</span> is a tourist attraction and they seen on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , the name of Simon Topas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">It’s a Simon Topas spelled exactly, not with a “z” but with an “s”’, Topas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235"><span class="REGION">Silemonca Spain</span> , familia Topas, familia Simon Topas Silemonca Spain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">I have -- just as I talk to you I just thought -- why I’m not able to find anything about this family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">Because I’m asking for the telephone number of Simon Topas at the Silemonca operator in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">I wrote to the Red Cross and to the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">He said the family of Simon Topas which means, if it were my brother, in the unlikely event, it is not he who wrote this --scribbled that name-- but maybe his son or his daughter who marked this in order to look for someone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">The name could be -- the first name could be different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">And if it was a daughter who was married and took another family name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">I think, in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , it works in reverse, the men assume the wife’s -- the family assumes the wife’s last name
QUESTION:  Yes, they use both.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1404">ANSWER:  My God, there were so many. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">Of course, I was flogged but this was not the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">The worst experience happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> , I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">When we arrived there, we were shipped from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luftwaffe camp</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Canjan</span> were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> and on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride we were debating what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">Most of us were young men; there were a few fathers among the young men that were with their sons in that group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">We were fortunate that we were only 88 to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> , where else there were about twice that number that they packed in others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">Many people perished just from suffocation when they --. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">We were debating what we should do, whether we should break out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> left about, with our contingent, about noontime, perhaps shortly before noon and was just meandering through the various <span class="NPIP">places</span> as it was going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">We said like this, that if it is going to go in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , we have nothing to lose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">We are just going to have to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">I know that there were people there already working on the floorOboards, trying to see if we could -- a novel way of escape trying to get out from the floor boards rather than the <span class="DLF">windows</span> that were normally used. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">They worked at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">I don’t think that they did get very far with this operation because within 15 or 20 minutes we found out that we are on a <span class="DLF">line</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">We felt that perhaps we are being taken to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">We didn’t know that besides <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> that there are so many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> , we didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">We didn’t know, maybe we didn’t want to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">We heard about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">Once this was found out, so the attitude changed and the despair that dominated the mood in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> subsided and they say maybe we are going to the camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">People sort of tried to slide down because we couldn’t -- there was not enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for everyone to sit or lie down but if everybody lean against everyone, somehow, the body sort of, like sardines, we were able to manage to be down where we could get some rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">Everybody got very thirsty because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> , the sun beat on them and it was hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">There was a fellow there with a bottle of water, He took out the bottle of water that he had the presence of mind to take with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">We had bread that we took with us, our rations, but we didn’t think of water, we did not think of that -- we didn’t think of it, we didn’t anticipate that 1t would be needed here, a big bottle of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">He was going to have some of the water with his son. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">But when he looked at the faces of us all, he says, no, no, my son, we'll have to share this water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">Somehow a spoon was produced and everybody got a tablespoon of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">This is the way it went all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">But the moment, I think my moment of greater despair came at the end of the journey because I could say when I stood in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> before a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">firing squad</span> , was this the worst moment? </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">No, because it happened so quickly and it came as a surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">Before we got scared enough, become numb. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">It was all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">I was also, a gun was pointed at me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> on a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> by a drunk, an SS officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">This ended up without me being shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">But here we’re traveling on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and there’s time on our hands and we were able to think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">Then it got dark and darker. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">Finally the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> slowed down and it was already beyond, not quite so dark that you couldn’t see but it was already further along than the dust, the hour of twilight when you can still see things relatively well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> -- there was also another incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">During the ride on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , a Polish peasant stood when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was very slowly moving after many stops that it made to give priority to other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">He seen our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and he crossed himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">So I said why would he do this unless we are a cargo assigned to extermination. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">I say after all, going to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> still leaves -- there is room for hope. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1445">End of Tape 11.) </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">The movement of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , very slow movement, when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is --when they are moving sections of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> on the final <span class="DLF">terminal</span> ; there’s more literally, this is literally what <span class="DLF">terminal</span> is the right word to use, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was moving very slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">You have the descending darkness, you see that we are being pushed through a tall <span class="DLF">masonry wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">It suddenly, it gave me the foreboding that we are being brought into the extermination point, because we were not given any rations for the trip; people were packed like sardines. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">If you want to get work out of slaves, you have to give them <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , you have to treat them with a modicum of satisfying the basic needs of subsistence to live on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">No water, nothing given for us to urinate or to tend to all other needs that are basic needs and suddenly this descending darkness and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> slowly -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> -- like we were going through the <span class="DLF">gates</span> of <span class="NPIP">hell</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1451">QUESTION:  That’s exactly what I was imagining.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1452">ANSWER:  And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came to a stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">When the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was traveling, we couldn’t hear nothing because you just hear the noise of the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> and the rails and the wind and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">But when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped, you could hear the screams of the women and children in other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> where they had women and children, where they were packed very heavily. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">Because the heat was unbearable and they had no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to urinate, they had no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">There was crying and lamenting and it all suggested a premonition of impending death by some means that we don’t know yet; whether it will be <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> or they have something else in store for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">Then on the <span class="DLF">platforms</span> , which on the right and a <span class="DLF">platform</span> on the left which separated us from the other section of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , there were big floodlights and there were guards that were standing on both sides. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">Were just maybe two or three guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">All of a sudden you hear the sound of a rolling <span class="DLF">door</span> open and a man, stripped down to his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trunks</span> , runs out of this heat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">He just runs and the Germans, the German guards, they begin to hunt him like a rabbit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">He says, Ich , Lhave him! </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">He says , halt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">This and so forth, then you hear two shots and you see this guy collapsing underneath one of those floodlights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">By that time the temperature must have dropped, this was in May, and you could see like a steam coming out from his mouth, the blood was running out of his neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">He was laying there, a human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">All he wanted was a little <span class="DLF">air</span> and he was shot for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">When I seen this, this scene itself was a -I seen people killed before by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">I have seen them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> but I have never seen this, when you put all these elements together, under such circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">Then the immediate logical conclusion is that we are not coming into any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">If you begin to add all these things and as the morning began to dawn, there was a rabbi in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">We have a prayer that is said before death; it 1s called confession before death, people say it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">He began to say the confession and he had a younger brother, Hanok was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">That guy began to cry that he is only twenty years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">This crying and praying became very unnerving to us although a man has a right to say what he wants before he dies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">We were still not convinced that this is the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">Nevertheless somebody asked them that they should stop this sobbing business and all this, wait to see what happens in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">In the morning, when they open the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> , there came a Jewish crew that was working and the Germans and the dogs, the whole circus. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">They began to open the <span class="DLF">doors</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and they begin to pile out the dead bodies from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">Ours was the only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> that didn’t have any dead bodies but from all other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , they were putting the bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">The Jewish crew went in and they were putting the bodies by stacking them in pyres, one on top of the other in squares. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">I seen young women, young men, it was just a frightening sight when you see so much death around you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">We were bewildered -- there were two hand grenades laying on the bottom of our <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">In other words, one of the -- some of our men had hand grenades and they were prepared to make a fight for it, if we escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">If we escaped and went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , we would have something; I mean that was the intention. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">I remember when we empty the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , the SS men take a look in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> ; they seen the hand grenades and they ignored it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">This was the final indication that we are slated for death because if we are not, they would certainly not allow something like this to go unpunished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">They would want a guilty party and they would make an execution; they would try to show how they deal with something like this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1488">QUESTION:  You’re all guilty already?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1489">ANSWER:  It doesn’t matter because we---. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">Then we were put in a, those that survived the trip were put in a column five abreast. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">The column was standing there and forming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">While they were forming and we seen that the crew---. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">Another thing 1s the cleaning crew that was working there, the Jews who were part of the crew of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , they wouldn’t speak to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">If we ask them, where are we? </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">What is awaiting us? </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">They didn’t say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">So you got the impression like you were on an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">operating table</span> ; you are in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and you see the nurses in white aprons looking at you as though you were dead already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">We didn’t know that they were not allowed to speak to us, we didn’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">Then the column began to form and there were about a dozen of SS men on each side of the column, guards with rifles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">They were going to escort us wherever we were going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">We begin the procession, slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">When I was walking, I was bewildered, what was happening there? </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">My thoughts were very incoherent, in a situation like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">The SS man that was on my left, that was next to me, I record this in the book, he said to me, Veir albist du?, </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">how old are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">I said, Ich bin I told him I was 18 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">He answered me I , 1m nineteen.. He says , It’s a pity that you have to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">He said it to me, he meant it; he had no---. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">That was — this is the way he felt apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">We were eventually separated from those that went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> ; but this moment, these moments in my life, including this question and answer and the pile-up of bodies in the morning and a beautiful morning to be surrounded by death, this arrival; this 1s probably the worst that I had to face. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">Because after that I became already immune to these -- not immune but I began to realize that sooner or later they’re going to get us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">That there’s a very slim chance of survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">So I was not going to get again -- I would not panic anymore in a situation that was awaiting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1514">QUESTION:  You think the worst and then you survive, then it’s almost a bonus?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1515">ANSWER:  Well, for some people who survived that particular moment was not the best thing because they perished later and they just suffered more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">But this was such a terrifying thing, this whole thing, the arrival, the descending darkness, the crying of the women, the pitiful crying of the children, and then the killing of that man who just run for a breath of fresh air, the prayers of the rabbi who survived, he lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">I met him in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> one time unexpectedly, and his brother survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">All these things are just terrifying more than anything else that I have experienced before or since. </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">Although I had many close calls after, I was with a flogged person; it didn’t affect me as badly as this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">I’m not going to tell you how we got out of this situation because then nobody’s going to buy my book.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1521">QUESTION:  We won’t go into that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">I was going to recall from another interview that I had, that there was an orchestra at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> , perhaps not at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">But it seems that was all that is lacking---.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1524">ANSWER:  I thought <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> had the orchestra.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1525">QUESTION:  An orchestra was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> but apparently there was one also at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> , perhaps at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">But you’re talking about 1942.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1527">ANSWER:  Forty-three.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1528">QUESTION:  Forty-three but early---?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1529">ANSWER:  May 12" or May 13".</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1530">QUESTION:  But you don’t recall any orchestra at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1531">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1532">QUESTION:  I don’t think 1t would have been at this point in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">It would have been somewhere else, like a <span class="DLF">work area</span> at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor section</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1534">ANSWER:  Could be because we were not, unbeknown to us, we were not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> proper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">We were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">entrance camp</span> and the reason they had the guards because they had to march us yet through a <span class="DLF">street</span> which I think is called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Helmska B</span> because it leads to <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">That would take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> and to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">This was our fate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">I studied the records of it from a book that was written of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> , by a Polish writer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">It’s not translated into English yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">I bought it in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> when I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">It said in that period of time, there were no registrations, everybody was going -- especially from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> -- everybody was going straight into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">Actually I was twice in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">At this time when we were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budzyn</span> and when we were shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budzyn</span> en route to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plaszow</span> , we detoured in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> so I was their guest again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">I omitted telling you -- it occurred to me that I omitted telling you -- something about my uncle Meynek. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">As you know, we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budzyn</span> from this transport in second week of May. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">That would put it about May 13 or thereabout. </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">When we arrived there, we found out that there was already one group of Warsaw survivors, Warsaw Ghetto uprising survivors who arrived there a week earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">One of the survivors, I believe his name was Kaufmann, a young fellow my age, recognized me and he said I got something to tell you about your Uncle Meynek. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">He was in our transport with his wife, that would be Irka on the <span class="DLF">umschlagplatz</span> after the crushing of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, they were herded on the <span class="DLF">umschlagplatz</span> into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">While he was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> with his wife, he was trying to bribe a Ukrainian guard, either to let him go which seems very unlikely; it seemed very unlikely that he would have asked him for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">Or he might have asked him for water because they were selling water for something like 500 zlotys a glass if they got the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">However, the Ukrainian guard after taking the money, shot my uncle and his wife, Irka, pulled off his riding boots from his legs, feet, and this is how my uncle came to an end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">I believe he was born 1907, he would have -- this was in May of 1943, he would have been 36 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">This is the story of our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">We had very few survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">That would be my Uncle Ben survived, my Aunt Rose survived because she was on Aryan papers and she was able to hide her identity and the only other survivor was myself and my grandmother who left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> on the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that reached the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">My father died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> , now we know, my mother and my youngest brother, Meir at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">Szymon still remains as enigma, as to what happened to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1559">QUESTION:  Still waiting or hoping for a miracle?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1560">ANSWER:  Yes, it’s hard to imagine that this late, we would not have been able to establish contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">Since even if he lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , he would know that most survivors went either to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and he would have tried to exhaust these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">There were no enquiries for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1563">QUESTION:  And then there’s your book, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1564">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1565">QUESTION:  He would have read a book about that story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1566">ANSWER:  But you know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">All this brings me to this understanding --that we, the Jewish people, are very old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">We have survived rising and falling civilizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">The Germans were trying to put an end to the Jewish people in a most barbaric way in the annals of mankind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">They didn’t succeed and I don’t think that any ruthless dictatorship would, in the future, succeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">But they never stop trying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">Okay, I think that we had enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1573">QUESTION:  Okay, thank you very much for sharing your story and your history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">I hope that it will be of great value, not only for the present, but for the future generations who study and recollection of the Holocaust. </span>
