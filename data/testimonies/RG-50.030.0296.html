<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  I need you to start off please by telling me what your name was at the time of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Where you were born and on what date?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  My name was Gertrude Granirer and I was born in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">Some 10 miles away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And I was born September 28, 1921.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  The name of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  The name, Sadagura (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="7">The meaning of that word, Sad means <span class="DLF">garden</span> , and Gura means <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">A <span class="DLF">garden</span> on the <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And this 1s -- the word was, I believe, Ukrainian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  Was it a lovely <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">For me it was a lovely <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Only three thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And all my studying I did in the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernivtsi</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Did you have a comfortable childhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  Very comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I was an only child and they discovered very early in my life that I had an inclination or a talent for music. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I would go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> , which was almost in every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of a middle class family, and I would play whatever I heard people singing and so they started me very early -- I was four years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And when I was six I already played little concerts. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">But my mother was not very keen for me to become a professional musician. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">It was only to round out my education. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">In fact, when she realized that I became very involved with music, she didn't like it very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">But by that time it was too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I was also, through my father, very interested in languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">My father had been turned from the first World War with a shrapnel (ph) in his hip which could never be removed. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And so he was a -- what do you call it -- a disabled person. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And he couldn't walk very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">He was a lawyer and he loved me very much and so I loved him too. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I was constantly next to him and he was very proud of my achievement. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Whatever he had taught me I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I would know all the capitols in the world of all the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and I would know all the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> and all the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> even in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And he never dreamed of going, leaving our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And so when I was about six years old I spoke five languages and had made up my mind that I would study languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">If possible, one new language each year. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I came up to ten languages and then the world fell apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And I realized that I could not afford that luxury any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  You said the world fell apart?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Well, 1938 and 39 we heard a lot of rumblings what went on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">We saw many people running away from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Some of them from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hlwolf</span> (ph) and coming into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And some of us opened our <span class="DLF">doors</span> for them and they told us how horrible things were. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And we heard a great deal about Hitler and on the radio when he was on, everybody listened. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And everybody was afraid, but nobody believed that he would, in fact, come to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We just felt very sorry for the people in those other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> where Hitler was. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And in 1940 Hitler and Stalin made this agreement. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Ah, and they were suddenly good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">In this agreement Stalin got half of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , the <span class="REGION">Baltic States</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bessarabia</span> , which was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , and for a good measure they also marched into the Bukovina which was never theirs before. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Why they did it, we don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I don't know to this date. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">But suddenly one day there was an ultimatum on the radio and the next day the Soviets marched in. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And before we knew it, we were Soviet citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">We did not know what would happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">In fact, their propaganda was so good that we, in fact, thought it must be better than it was because before that the Rumanians were close friends with the Nazis and, in fact, they did the bidding of the Nazis and Atonescu was the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Well, so we thought "this is an improvement". </span><span class="sentence" id="57">But somehow I have to get back for a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">My mother has, had a brother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> , <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Very rich man. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">He saw it coming and he chartered a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and came to Europe to pick all his relatives and none of them wanted to go, including my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">In our case, my parents said -- my father, which was my stepfather -- my father died when I was nine. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">My stepfather said "ah I have no reason to go and live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> , <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I haven't done anything wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I haven't engaged in politics, nothing 1s going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I'm not going to throw away all the things that we have worked so hard for." </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And they stayed and they didn't ask me, so I stayed with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So, in fact, my uncle who came by to pick us up, and we didn't go, said to us that in case we changed our mind he will had prepared four visas to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Two for my parents, one for me, and one, preferably if I had a boyfriend to bring him along. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Because at that time I was sixteen, seventeen. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Ah, 1t would be better he thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Well we didn't go and so the Soviets marched 1n and the world fell apart for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Times were not tough under the Rumanians?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  Yes, they were tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">They were very tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And especially 1937, 1938, 1939, our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had a <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Soldiers and particularly officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And they got often drunk and they roamed the streets and cursed the Jews and shot, you know, they went around with guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">It was frightening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  Did you feel particularly vulnerable as a girl?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  Some. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I had times where I felt very vulnerable. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And I have a hard time trying to bring back many memories which I probably have absolutely wanted to forget.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  Were the girls abused?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  So you said that the Soviets came in and the world fell apart?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">The strange thing at that time -- 1t was June 28, 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">That is when the Soviets marched in. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And, you know, during the day and in the early part of the evening, it was fantastic what kind of concerts they gave. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">What kind of excitement they managed to bring out in the people and nobody would have believed that a few days later, during the night, they came and people disappeared in the thousands. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And at that time we didn't know where they were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And it so happened that in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in which we lived we had a very beautiful <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Probably the best <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we were very wealthy and that was very much against us. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I didn't even realize it at that time because I was friends with all kinds of children, never thinking about these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">But, immediately there were people who wanted this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they moved in and then one night three uniformed men came in the Russian uniform of what was called NK VD, which is now called MVD or KGB. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They rang the doorbell. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">They came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">They searched our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We didn't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">My stepfather, my mother, my grandmother and I were made to sit in the corner and I noticed how this one -- after they had turned the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> upside down -- this one of them said "hey look there" while he was pulling out a handkerchief and blowing his nose and I saw how he dropped something, and at the same moment he said "look here what they have" and it was either a five or a ten dollar bill. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">It was the first time in my life that I saw a dollar bill. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But I didn't know the implication of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I was going to say "you dropped this from your pocket" but I couldn't because the next thing all three of them came up to my father and said "you just have to come with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We found foreign currency in your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">You just have to sign a paper and you will come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="107">We never saw him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We don't know what they did to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I know he was 48 years old at that time and my mother would go every day to some <span class="NPIP">place</span> where many other people stood in <span class="DLF">line</span> with food to bring their husbands, to whom exactly the same thing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And after she went for -- I don't know, three weeks, one day another guard stood there and said "why are you coming here? </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Your husband isn't here". </span><span class="sentence" id="112">She said yes is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I've been bringing this food for three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">If he is not here for a long time? </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And then one day the head guard called her in and said to her "don't come any more". </span><span class="sentence" id="116">She said my husband is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">He's not here any more and threw his shoe at her. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And he said "here is your husband and don't ask any more questions or you will have the same ending". </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So we don't know, but I do suspect that they killed him and I don't know where he is buried and I wish I would. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">This was so traumatic for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I think 1t was worse than anything that came afterwards, including the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">By the time the Nazis took us into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> I was so numb <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , I was so dead, I was not able to feel anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And so when Sam told you about how we met, for me the world had ended and here was this man who had jokingly said "we can get married". </span><span class="sentence" id="124">That was the farthest from my thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">My mother had said "run and go wherever you can and hide." </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And I was running from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that evening for about ten hours until I came to this other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">It was very difficult because they had -- what do you call this, at night when you are not allowed to go -- curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Well I made it somehow, very tired, exhausted and very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And I thought of going to my parents' best friends at whose <span class="BUILDING">house</span> I had stayed a whole year until the end of May of that year. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I came to their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">They opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they wouldn't let me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And they told me forgive us. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But last night, 1t was an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> , next door, there was a raid and they came into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and they found one person in that family who did not have a permit with this particular address and because of that they took her and the entire family and they disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And so these people would not let me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">At that moment I had no idea where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">The only thing that remained was to remember the Philharmonia. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">That's a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> was located where I had studied and where I had finished <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> about also four weeks before the Russians came. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And I went upstairs into a <span class="INT_SPACE">projection room</span> where they also had a <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span> and I fell down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and went to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And when I woke up it was day and I thought if I could find somebody in this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and if they would give me a job as a pianist, as a accompanist, maybe I could simply hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">But I knew they were after me because they were after our family and so I went and I met the man who was in charge and he was just closing up the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And I said I am looking for a job as an accompanist, as a pianist. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">He said to me "you look to me like you need a lunch, that's where I am going now". </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I said no, "please get me a job", but I didn't tell him what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And he said how much money do you have and I said three rubles. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">That's 75 cents. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And he said that's enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I said enough for what. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Enough to get married he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">He said I can see you don't know where you're going to sleep the next night, I can see it in your face. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">He didn't know my name, he didn't know who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So he starts walking in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I walked after him and I said please get me that job. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And suddenly he stops and he says "come up here with me". </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Two flights of <span class="DLF">steps</span> , very dark, old, dilapidated <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and upstairs is a young girl, about seventeen, and this is supposed to be the <span class="BUILDING">Registrar's Office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And so she asks him if he came to get married and he said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">This girl, asks "are you living with another woman?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="156">No". "</span><span class="sentence" id="157">Do you have children with another woman?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="158">No". </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And she asked me the same thing and every question is an insult in my book because I, I was so properly brought up I didn't even have a date. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So when we were ready to sign this little paper she calls over the man who swept the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> in the corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">To this day I don't know his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And he was the witness who signed and we went downstairs and Sam, my husband, said to me "by the way, what's your name?" </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And we went back to the <span class="BUILDING">Philharmonia</span> and he enrolled me. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Gave me a job as an accompanist, pianist, and he said "now no more running around. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Five o'clock we meet in front of this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ". </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I don't know what he thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I didn't know where I would run but he had told me that he has a mother and a sister and an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I didn't believe a word he said to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I thought of one thing only. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Where could I hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And suddenly I realized that I had changed my name because I married. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And my name is no longer the one that these authorities were looking for. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">So I went with him and when he came into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , I had a big surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">He did have a mother and he did have a sister and they were wonderful to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And that was like a miracle somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">That is the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  Did you, what happened to your mother after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  A few weeks later - my mother had, in the meantime, also left the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because all these other people who wanted our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> moved in and one person who probably had a little bit of heart said to my mother, "you better disappear from here or you will have a bad ending". </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So my mother came into this larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with her mother-in-law, and they rented a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and they both went to find some job to become a proletarian, and my mother found a job to become a cook in an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and I saw her a few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I went every morning to this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And one morning I went there and there was a big sign. "</span><span class="sentence" id="184">This <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> has been confiscated and the inhabitants have been enemies of the people" and so I know that at this moment, my mother and my grandmother had disappeared, but we didn't know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Now a long time later we found out -- not even so long, because in three nights 35,000 people had the same fate, and they were brought to an end <span class="BUILDING">station</span> outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , and when they were filled they were, left the <span class="REGION">area</span> and nobody where to. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">But many, many years later we found out that they were taken to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And my mother was 17 years in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">My grandmother died immediately, one or two days in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And it's strange because my grandmother was only 73 and at that time my mother was 48.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">QUESTION:  Did your mother come back from <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">ANSWER:  We found her in the most difficult manner. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">We, after we went through <span class="NPIP">hell</span> and came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> -- actually first to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> , <span class="REGION">South America</span> where my mother had a brother- then we came here and my uncle, my mother's brother, found -- one day he received a letter by a lady, Mrs. Weisselberger (ph), who was in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> and roomed together with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And there was a moment in the Soviet's time under Khrushchev when he decided -- you know, you remember that he stood up and said how what a monster Stalin had been -- and Khrushchev had then permitted people over 65 if they had close relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And if these relatives sent an invitation to them, an obligated themselves to take care of them, he would permit them to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And this Mrs. Weisselberger who, by the way, was the widow of the, of the greatest Zionist 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , and he was one of the first the Soviets did away with, and afterwards Mrs. Weissenberger was also taken to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> as the wife of the enemy of the people, and my mother had given Mrs. Weissenberger a photo that was taken in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> and on the back of it had written the address of her brother in <span class="REGION">South America</span> because she didn't know what had happened to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And so, when, when, he received this note he sent it to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">That's how we found her. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  You were telling us about finding your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  As soon as we got this letter, and we lived in <span class="REGION">Minnesota</span> and were already very successful as musicians, and well known. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">We knew Senator Humphry who was at that time the senator of <span class="REGION">Minnesota</span> , and we got in touch with him and he said he'd do whatever he could to see whether he could get her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And after some time he said "sorry, the Soviets say they don't have such a person". </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Then some more time went by and we approached the other senator from <span class="REGION">Minnesota</span> , Senator Phye. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">He said he would try. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And this was maybe a year later and at that time the Soviets said "yes, there is such a person". </span><span class="sentence" id="205">They would, would, let her out if somebody, some relative in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , would ask for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">She didn't have any relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> but Sam had an uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">He wrote to him and this uncle, who had never set eyes on my mother, had filled out some papers and she was finally permitted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">But I have to tell you that this, from the moment we had this first notification that she had survived and until she came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , was eight years. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So after she arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> we did whatever we could and we brought her to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and I saw her again and we were like two complete strangers. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">She was so different. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">She was so hard -- so, so aloof. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I can't even describe it and there was nothing much I could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I wanted very much to ask her to talk and she couldn't talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Finally I got it out of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">One day I got very angry and I said "please, tell me what has happened; can't you tell me?"</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  She started talking?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And she finally said to me that she had undergone some hypnosis and they had told her -- "you want to see your daughter again, you want to see your son-in-law again, you want to see your brother again, then you have to forget everything that happened to you". </span><span class="sentence" id="219">She didn't want to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">She promised she would forget.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  OK, so you said that living under the Soviets was really horrible?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  Horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And they said to me and to others, "you can never run away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">We find you everywhere". </span><span class="sentence" id="225">You know, that sits so deep in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I can't get over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I simply can't get over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">So.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  Do you remember the things you saw, under the Soviet occupation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  You never saw anything because they did everything very, very smoothly. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Behind closed <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">You never saw anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">You only knew that people disappeared, and when, by chance, you found them like I found my mother, I couldn't get a word our of her to her dying day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION:  So what happened, the Germans marched in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">QUESTION:  And things changed again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">QUESTION:  Were you married then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">At that time I was already married. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And the first thing that I remember is that they came and took all the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Not the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">All the men from our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and from the whole <span class="DLF">street</span> and marched them, I think by foot, and we didn't know where they were taking them. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Then we found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">There was a big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that they, the Russians had called <span class="BUILDING">Palace of Culture</span> and that same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , under the Germans, was used for certain purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">They took those men -- these were all Jewish people -- and the rumor went that they took them to shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And I knew at the moment that I will never see Sam again. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And somehow it was very, very difficult to accept. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">But all of a sudden, some hours later, I saw him running down the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I thought that I was having a vision -- that I was imagining. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">But he did come and he said that they had put them up to count one-two-three, one-two- three. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Every one was taken to be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And he was not one, but they took him and many others to bury them. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">So they marched them down to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and they forced those that they had not shot to bury them. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And Sam managed, knowing the <span class="REGION">area</span> very well, managed to somehow to jump out of the <span class="DLF">line</span> and, through certain side <span class="DLF">streets</span> , he was out of there and he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">QUESTION:  Do you remember when this was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  This was a few days after the Germans occupied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">That is, 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">When they began to, to, to, push east, and the Soviets ran like crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">The Soviets had not believed that Hitler would do this to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I mean the Soviets, Stalin. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Stalin did not believe that Hitler was preparing to run into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And you know, in fact, his generals who told him that -- warned him, some of them were executed because they said it. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">No, by the time this happened Stalin had executed so many of his best people. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Generals. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And, so when the Soviets ran away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , they couldn't run as fast as the Nazis followed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And this happened a few days after the Nazis came into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">QUESTION:  I understand that the Soviets in leaving were burning the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">QUESTION:  Were you in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">This is a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and you did see lots of smoke, lots of <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">But mostly you were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">You were trying not to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">You couldn't go anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">You were just in your <span class="NPIP">place</span> hoping that they will not come for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  Was there lot's of hysteria?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I really don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I don't think there was much time for that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">QUESTION:  So Sam made it through this first --
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And they didn't even notice that he had absconded from that <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Because otherwise they would have come for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">But it was all so haphazard, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">It was not by name at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">QUESTION:  Now where were the Romanians who were officials. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Didn't they eventually take over?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">ANSWER:  They were part of what went on, but I didn't see too many of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">They were probably together with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And I understood that some people were explaining away this horror of the German's idea and the Romanians to kill at random. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">You know our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sadagura</span> (ph), that was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">When, on the evening of the departure of the Soviets they ran so fast that the Germans were not even in there and there was a whole night where nobody was in there, in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And the local population who were mostly Ukrainians, rounded up all the Jews that were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">They pushed them up onto a <span class="DLF">hill</span> and killed them and raped the women and everybody was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">This was a massacre. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">This was an awful massacre. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I've heard this from a few people who know exactly how that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">But this was neither the Soviets nor the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">This was the local population.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">QUESTION:  Was that typical of the Ukrainians?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">ANSWER:  I suppose so. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">You know at that time I was so innocent. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I could never believe that people could do things like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">QUESTION:  So was it shortly after the Germans occupied the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that you were herded up and put in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">ANSWER:  Ah, not shortly. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I think a few weeks later. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">If you could call it shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  What happened, what was that like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  Well, they, I think that we saw posters which said that as of tomorrow morning, such and such hour, all the Jews have to leave the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> and are allowed to live only in such and such <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And everybody went meekly. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Nobody fought. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">There was no, no possibility to fight.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="316">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I heard some say a few days, but I'm not even sure that this is correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">It, it was really awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And you know, the whole thing 1s actually fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">The horror of what happens to you and the even greater horror of what may happen tomorrow, because you see in which direction this is going, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">QUESTION:  Other than the fear, were the conditions horrible, did you have food, could you come and go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">ANSWER:  I would say that the conditions were not eh, extraordinary. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">On the <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> they were horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Pure horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">You know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">QUESTION:  So you were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for some time near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Interance</span> (ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">By the way, we were in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> of a friend of mine with whom I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and they happened to live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">They happened to have an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> there and they took us in, so we shared their <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And, we were not the only ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">There must have been 8 or 10 or 12 people in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">But that was then --
QUESTION:  Were the selections beginning? </span><span class="sentence" id="334">There was a big deportation early on.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  So what was your next move after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">ANSWER:  I suppose after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> we were put into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">QUESTION:  Were you pulled up, how did this come about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">It's amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Would you believe that a person could block out to such an extent? </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Well anyway, we were in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">We didn't know where they were taking us and we finally arrived somewhere where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> stopped and we were told that this was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mogilev</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">This was on the <span class="DLF">border</span> of -- between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bessarabia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> -- and there came some -- by the way, we were told to take along only what we could carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And, naturally most people could carry very little, but what they could carry was sometimes earrings, or a watch, or a necklace, or a bracelet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">QUESTION:  Did Sam take his violin?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">ANSWER:  Did Sam take his violin? </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I think he took his violin and then somebody took it away from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Am I right? </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Sam: I prepared my worst violin because I knew they would steal it and so they stole it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">ANSWER:  Anyway, before we were embarking on what Sam called a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> , which I don't recall at all; I think it was a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I know we had to go through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , so there is no doubt about that, but to me a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> is something large you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">This was a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and his sister said "I'm not going in. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I'm afraid this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> will collapse." </span><span class="sentence" id="362">She was absolutely not aware of where she was going you know, but she did go. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">So before going into this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> you saw a mass of people on the shore of that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> waiting to be taken on this little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Eh, if there were 2,000 or 3,000 or more people, there were maybe 4 or 5 maybe who could into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and there was, I think, just this one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And suddenly there was an announcement to all the people who were there on this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="366">No gold or valuables permitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">If we find anything on you, you get shot." </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And in one split second everybody took off their rings and their watches and their necklaces and dropped it as if it didn't belong to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And in one second you saw a whole <span class="REGION">area</span> full of gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">In the next moment you saw the natives of that <span class="REGION">area</span> , the Ukrainians and the soldiers, the Romainian soldiers, picking up these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">That's my recollection. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Then when we were taken over on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> -- we arrived in the carara de pietra (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="373">The <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">You know pietra is stone and carara (ph) is the same word like 1n Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">That <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> was an unbelievable experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">About a week before we came, they had taken the inmates of the <span class="BUILDING">insane asylum</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , put them in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and brought them to the same carara de pietra (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Didn't give them any food and had them starving and a week later they took the intelligencia of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , the, the people who were educated, and put them in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and we were among them. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And they brought us to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> where insane people had been going for one week without food. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And what we saw there was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">They were eating each other alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">This is absolutely unforgettable and incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And there we stayed, I cannot remember for how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And Wassileskov (ph) was the Commandant. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">A fairly young man, I would say probably no more than 45, and he marched around with a whip and when he found a louse on a person, that person got 25 in front of everybody else, over their behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Over their naked behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">So when I hear of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Singapore</span> I am no longer very impressed you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">So, what else can I tell you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="388">QUESTION:  What else was going on at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="389">ANSWER:  I don't know very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I think once a day it was permitted for certain people only - not everybody - to go down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> on the bottom of this carara (ph) was a little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">stream</span> , very little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">stream</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">The natives who lived in the <span class="REGION">area</span> came with whatever they had to, to offer, to sell, to barter, a piece of butter or a piece of bread, or a piece of cheese. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">The women usually were hiding them in their bosom. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And they stood on one side of that stream and the inmates of our group stood on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and were showing what they had to barter. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">One had a blouse or one was offering maybe a pair of shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Anything for just a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And then, if that person on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> pointed at this blouse, yes, that's what I want and I have a piece of bread, then they come a step closer into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> and they exchange this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION:  Did you exchange anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">ANSWER:  I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">It's so unbelievable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">QUESTION:  How did you sleep there?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="486">ANSWER:  No, I can't think of anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">It is only a miracle that we survived and that we are here to talk about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">QUESTION:  When were you liberated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">ANSWER:  We were "liberated" in I'd say 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">But very early in the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I would say we began to hear noises like cannons -- I think it was January or February -- and I said to Sam "now the front is getting so close, now they will kill us all." </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Because it was well known that the Germans, when they retreated, they set a whole thing on fire and they killed everybody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And I said "it's unbelievable that we have survived until now and now we're going to die", and you know, this was January, February, no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> to hide in. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">At least in the summer the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> have leaves, you know, no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> to hide in. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">None of the native Ukrainians wanted to hide us. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">They would not risk their life, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And I said, "Sam, what are we going to do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="498">and I got so vehement and so excited that I banged with my foot on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in which we lived, and suddenly as I banged, I heard a hollow noise as though it was empty underneath and I said, "Sam, did you hear what I just heard? </span><span class="sentence" id="499">It seems to me that there is nothing underneath. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Maybe we could hide there." </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And we had a neighbor who was an engineer, Rosenfeld, and he was the kind of man -- what his job was, he went also out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the morning, worked for, for the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , but he fixed radios. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">So he was the one who radios all day long and came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and told us all the news that went on in the outside world, which was amazing because we never had a paper or anything or a radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">So we told Rosenfeld -- I told him -- we are going to have to hide if we want to survive and nobody will take us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Could we try and see if we could hide right in our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , I have heard a hollow sound. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And he just had a smile but he humored me and he came into our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and he tried and he said "you are right". </span><span class="sentence" id="506">So he brought -- where he got this, I don't know -- a saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Now these were, these were <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> in the old fashioned kind, you know, long boards. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And so he was sawing one board here and then two later, like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Finally he made an <span class="DLF">opening</span> and we did find an <span class="DLF">opening</span> down there which was very raw and nothing in there, and everybody who was in our <span class="REGION">area</span> knew about it and laughed about us. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">They thought that I was crazy, out of my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And when the day came and they, the shootings, came closer and closer, we had amassed a lot of straw which we had brought into our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and since about 18 people knew about this crazy idea, these 18 people came and went downstairs with us and we thought it would be an hour or two or three. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Well, they kept coming and coming and before we knew it, we were standing one next to the other and how many were we -- 68 people down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">We closed this thing and had all this straw on top and all of a sudden -- now this was already night -- all of a sudden we heard footsteps on top of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">We knew that the Germans were running away but we heard footsteps directly above us and we recognized by their marching, by their walking, that these were Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">What had happened -- they had chosen that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to stay over night because they didn't see anybody there and there was a lot of straw there, and we sat there underneath, 68 people not daring to breathe or cough or anything, and the next morning they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And then we began to, to smell smoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And we knew that they had put some <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> on fire and someone in our group of 68 people -- a woman started yelling, "I don't want to die, to suffocate here. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I want out. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I want out." </span><span class="sentence" id="520">So by that time we opened the thing and the Germans were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">We came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">We were green and white as a sheet and we saw in front of us three young Russian boys with very long coats and with rifles and we asked them "who are you" and they said "nastuyahschi (ph), Russki partisan (ph)." </span><span class="sentence" id="523">We are the real Russian partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And they said to us "and who are you" and we tried to explain to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">They didn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">That's how we were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">They we could dream only of going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">That's a very different story. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">We couldn't get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> until a few days later because we found a truck driver who wanted vodka and then he gave him the vodka and he took us up to a forrest and dropped us down there and said "that's enough for you." </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And then --
QUESTION:  Where did you get the vodka?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">ANSWER:  Where did we get the vodka? </span><span class="sentence" id="532">We ran around among the natives and whatever we still had on us we shared. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And the worst thing was when we finally came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">We were dreaming of returning to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="535">We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">We waited for hours and hours and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was an open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , when we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , a woman came close to Sam and said "don't go up the Banastrasse (ph)", the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the railroad people because they are taking people to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">She said it only in Yiddish, in a short word mancopt (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="539">That means they are catching people. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">So we did not go there and so we were sort of trying to get to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which we finally made and there were some people there and they, when we opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and said this is our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , they said "it's not going to be very long your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because you are not going to be here very long because this is our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="541">So we very quickly disappeared from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And then we tried desperately to get into the Czech Army, which we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">QUESTION:  Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">ANSWER:  We had to go somewhere and we had to go as far west as we could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">QUESTION:  Why the Czech Army?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">ANSWER:  Because they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">We had no choices. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">The Czech army were wonderful to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And we were good to them but they were wonderful to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And we were constantly in the Czech Army between the devil and the deep blue <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Because in front of us were the Nazis, never more than one or two miles, no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And behind us were the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">So, we were there from middle 1944 until 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">QUESTION:  Was it frightening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  Frightening? </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Different. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Very different because, first of all, we had one or two meals a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">It was beans, always beans, but 1t was something. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Much more than we had before. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And frightening yes because at every step you were stepping on a <span class="DLF">mine</span> or one of your colleagues were killed, or somebody lost their eyes, or somebody lost their limbs. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I did a lot of concertizing (ph) for the Czech Army soldiers before they were sent out into battle with an accordion and singing folk songs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">QUESTION:  Did you play the accordion or the piano?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">ANSWER:  Both. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And I knew that when I am sent out to sing for a thousand soldiers, I knew these were being sent out into a battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">The next day I was sent to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I found many of these people without arms, without legs, and this was a very small army, so we were very good friends all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And this was very tough, but it was the best part of our odyssey.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">QUESTION:  I meant to ask you, in all of this time did your musical background play a part -- ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">ANSWER:  In the Czech Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I knew that this was lost for me forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I could not believe that I would ever return to music. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I thought music is much too, too unimportant. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">But I found out music is not unimportant. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Music is very, very important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">QUESTION:  So you were in the Czech Army until the war ended?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">We liberated a number of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Our, our unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">By the way, I was the only woman amongst 75 men because I wanted to remain with Sam. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I made a special petition to the commanding general to permit me to stay with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">They didn't like it because they did have women, but in the rear. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">In the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , 1n <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I wanted to be in the <span class="DLF">front line</span> because that's where Sam was. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And they permitted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And we liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L'vov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L'vov</span> I had a very interesting experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Coming out -- I was in the front of that whole group, marching into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L'vov</span> and I had a small snare drum in front. - </span><span class="sentence" id="587">QUESTION FROM AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSON - -
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And then, of course, we also liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">QUESTION:  It must be very odd being the only woman?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">ANSWER:  I didn't even think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">But I had 75 wonderful friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">They were the greatest. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">They were really the greatest. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Wonderful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">You know who they were? </span><span class="sentence" id="596">They were people who had run away from Hitler when he marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and they had run into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> they thought they would be safe, but they encountered the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And the Soviets had a very, very interesting way of dealing with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">They would ask them, "What's your name?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="599">Edward and Povachkowve (ph)" after your father. "</span><span class="sentence" id="600">Adolfovich" (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Ahh. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Adolfovich, three years", because Hitler's name was Adolph. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So they gave him three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And these people were all in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> when they put together the Czech Army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">QUESTION:  They were independent of every one else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="606">ANSWER:  The Czech Army was fighting next to the Soviets, but independently. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">In fact, they got the uniforms and food from the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">We thought of ourselves as the allied army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="609">QUESTION:  Where were you when the war ended?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">They wanted us to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">They would have liked very much for us to stay, and I said, "Sam, no more Europe for me, I've had it." </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And the funniest part was before we entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> we entered in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was -- well anyway, we got an order to arrest anybody who speaks German on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Koshetse (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="615">So we got this order and I said "Sam, if I have to arrest a person because they speak a language --"
QUESTION:  And they spoke it 500 years.</span></p>
