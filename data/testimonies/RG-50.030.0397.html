ANSWER:  No, my father grew up as a -- after his par -- parents -- his parents died very, very early at his age.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Can you tell us a little bit about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that you born in, and that you grew up in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">There were 31,000 Jews living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bendezin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Of course there’s not a trace of them today in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Life was very interesting and families were extremely close. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My grandfather lived across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Life was not abundant in riche -- riches, but somehow we -- we felt that we are destined to play an important role in the life of humankind, that we have given the world the 10 commandments, not in order to achieve power, but to set moral examples. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">To set standards of how to deal, how men should deal with God, how men should deal with -- with man. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I went, as a youngster to a religious, Zionist school. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I stayed there for about four years and then my parents transferred me into a secular [indecipherable] school. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I remember Friday -- Fridays very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">My mother wil -- getting up very early, going to buy [indecipherable] chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And there was excitement of a Friday. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Saturday morning I used to go with my grandfather, and sometimes with my father to pray. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> on Saturday was completely engulfed in silence. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">You see only Jewish people marching to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , quietly. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">The prayers were -- were [indecipherable] and you felt some sacredness in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I loved those Fridays and I loved those Saturdays. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Furthermore, I remember that Jews from its -- Jews from surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> were coming to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in order to buy chicken, fish and bring them into the shochet, the ritual slaughterer. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">They were -- they were buying all -- always for the whole week and then came the next Friday again. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I was extremely happy in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , learning about Zionism, learning about -- about Jewish religion, and developing an extremely fond love for the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> -- the cultural life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was on a very high level. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">There was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish theater</span> , there was a Jewish newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">There was a voluntary symphony orchestra. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">There was a -- was a big <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And there were sports clubs, and we always were trying to participate in the sport events. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">The community, however, was divided. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">There were people who belonged to a very radical Zionist movement, the Zhabotinsky movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And there were again [indecipherable] especially where some of my friends belonged to a socialist Zionist movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And in the middle there was the mean, mean Zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">People who did not try to define themselves as -- as right wingers or left wingers. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">The Orthodox community was also divided. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">There were strictly Orthodox groups, and then there were groups that did not only believe that prayer is the answer to our problems, but forming or creating, or returning to our ancient homeland is extremely important. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">My two sisters belonged to that general Zionist organization, and I, as a young man, felt that perhaps the Zortinsky movement, the movement that was teaching us to go and move to it -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and fight, I felt at that time that this is the only solution. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">In my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , I did not feel any anti-Semitism when I grew up, because there were not too many Gentiles in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and there was no contact whatsoever between the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Christian community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">We lived separate -- separate lives, not mingling with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I remember my teachers were -- who I liked very, very much, they really cared. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I remember my uncles, merchants and [indecipherable], aunts that - more pious than their husbands. </span><span class="sentence" id="57"><span class="BUILDING">School</span> friends who were bookworms, and others who really didn’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">But the discussions among all those groups were very heated. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">We really believed in our cause, and tried to convince those others to join us. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">We did not have any luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">They were also convinced in their just cause. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">There was a communist movement in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Their aim was to move to <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> , create a state there. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I remember the name of the state that they were trying to -- to establish, they call it Biro Blam. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Someplace in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I did not meet any of them after the war, and I don’t believe that some of them survived in the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Can you tell me some more about --
ANSWER:  About what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  About the group that you were involved in --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  -- that -- can you say the name again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  It was a revisionist organization formed by a leader, his name was Zeev Zhabotinsky.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  And to become a member of that did you have to petition in any way, I mean --
ANSWER:  No, no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">We did not have to do anything, you have to join them. [</span><span class="sentence" id="73">indecipherable] organization, and most of the people, please understand, were my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Older people did not belong to those organizations, to those radical organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Most of them were part of the general Zionist movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  What did it mean to be a member, and how -- how did you get together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  We were getting together sometimes in the evenings, but mostly Saturdays afternoon, discussing events in the Jewish world, expressing our opinion, and participating in all events that were taking place in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , whenever somebody came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to speak to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Those were really wonderful years, really wonderful years. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">My two sisters did belong to the general Zionist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And I’m not sure that I remember, but it seems to me that m-mostly -- my organization, there were mostly men. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I don’t remember any women in my organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But in the general Zionist organization, there were a lot of women.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  Can you tell us the names of your sisters? </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I don’t believe you --
ANSWER:  My older sister’s name was Esther. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">My younger sister’s name was Rushka.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  And at this point when you were in this youth group, or this group, now how old are you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  At that time I must have been 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Around 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  Did your parents have opinions about the group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  No, my parents belonged to the general Zionist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">This is perhaps one of the reasons that my sis -- two sisters joined that organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">They felt more comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">It may be also that most of their friends belonged to that same organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  Did anyone in the family have a strong reaction to the fact that you were 1n a separate group? </span><span class="sentence" id="95">What -- what, for instance, did your father or your mother say about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  My father and my mother were very tolerant people, and they felt that if this 1s what I would like to do, this is the organization that I would like to belong to, they will not interfere. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They will not interfere, as long as it is a Zionist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Did my uncles, who were very pious people object to it? </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">They actually also belong to -- to radical Zionist organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  What were the goals of the group that you were part of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  The goal was, first of all, as long as we cannot move to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , to develop a strong sense of Jewish identity, reinforcing the feelings that we had in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , reinforcing it in such a way that -- that we were more free to discuss things. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And I don’t [indecipherable] discussing events and problems that are taking place not only in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We used to get newspapers, discuss articles, have -- have opinions. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And all of 1t was very exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">We were looking forward to those meetings, sometimes in the evening, but most of the time on Saturdays afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  How did -- how do you make sense of a kind of -- th-the fact that you went your separate way from the family, and that you were very passionate? </span><span class="sentence" id="109">How do you explain that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  I was young, and I was concerned with the rest of -- the rest of -- with the members of [indecipherable] who felt that -- especially the older [indecipherable] that felt that we should not hasten the arrival of the Messiah, that we have no right to do things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I was resentful of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And I strongly believed that only power will force the English people to let us come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Only our determination and our willingness to fight and not wait for the goodwill of the English government, is the only solution.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  Did you imagine yourself perhaps, getting smuggled in there and becoming a -- a military --
ANSWER:  Ye -- yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I know that some of my friends who still live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> came in 1936 or 1937 as illegal immigrants, being brought into <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in a very clandestine way. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I’m asking myself why didn’t I go. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">It’s a very painful question. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Perhaps even though I felt that this is the only way, and to feel that way, you have to have courage. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Could be that I did not have the courage to go along with, being 17 or 18 years old and start a life on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">My family was a very close family, and I never developed a feeling that I can be alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And that prevented me from making that fateful decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">In hindsight of course, I would have been much better off, and perhaps that bothers me, and perhaps convince my two sisters after I will be there, that they should do the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">It bothers me. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">On the other hand I have doubts that my sisters would leave our parents alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">They were not young any more, and I am not sure that they would have accept this idea of going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and abandoning -- I’m using that word because this is the way they felt probably, abandoning our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">My two sisters, if we can go to a different topic, joined me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> when I went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in 19 - nine -- 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">In 1937 they joined me. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I was transferring to the <span class="BUILDING">business academy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> only to be able to get into <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">But the quota was very low and I didn't make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I transferred to the <span class="BUILDING">business academy</span> and my si -- two sisters came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But at the same time, I’m not proud of myself, I’m proud of my youngest sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">We made a deal, all three of us, that every Friday one of us would go and spend the -- the weekend of the Shabbat with our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">My youngest sister never failed to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I had sometimes a -- an event that I wanted to attend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , sports event or cultural event. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">On Friday morning I was turning to my youngest sister and tell Rushka, I am not going. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">It is my turn but I am not going, you better go. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And she always went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">She never left my parents alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Talk a little bit about what -- ca -- what a regular day was like in your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I guess this 1s before you went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , but when you were growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">What your mother did during the day, a little bit about your father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  My father was a merchant. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">My moth -- mother was a housewife, like in every Jewish family at that time, maybe even every Christian family. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We had our <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that my father built in 1929. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">We lived on the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and there were three floors above us. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Was a very, very capable man, even though he grew up without his parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">He was a self taught individual who cared very much about the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I was very close to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">My father, even though he had very little schooling, became in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> of 31,000 Jews, the vice president of [indecipherable] you can call it today the federation, or whatever you want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">That was very unusual because every two years were elections. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">This was not an appointed position, you had to win the election to -- to- to be part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">He won every election as long as -- as much as I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">He had a very wonderful way of dealing with people, and my father became the [indecipherable] a representative of a big, big <span class="BUILDING">manufacturing firm</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , and if people that are buying anything that were produced by that -- that manufacturing outfit, they had to come to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And I also remember the recession. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">My father just finished building the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and all of a sudden it became very, very difficult to accept the fact that people are not paying their bills. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And please understand that in most of the <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> , people were buying and mi -- and signing a note. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And my father [indecipherable] those notes in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> , all of a sudden he confronted the fact that they’re not paying their notes, and he has to -- he has to redeem those notes. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">It was a very difficult time because he locked himself in one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , and did not want to listen to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But as I told you, my father grew up as an orphan, and he had the -- he had three brothers and two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">The older brother raised the family, and was a very wise man but lived in a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , about 15 or 20 kilometers from u -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bendezin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And he came and stayed with my father for a long time and convince him that not everything is lost, and you should get in touch with this -- with that manufacturer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and see if they will help him. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And that what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">They came and they bailed out my father, who later on, of course, became again a very, very successful businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And those were times that were really threatening. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We -- we felt that perhaps we have to -- we have to leave <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and that was to me, to my sisters, unacceptable. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">But thank God for my uncle, and that -- that <span class="BUILDING">manufacturing company</span> in -- in ro -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> that saved us and our family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  Do you remember the -- End of Tape One Beginning Tape Two

<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  Strochlitz.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  And can you tell us a little bit about your mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="175">H-How your mother would spend an ordinary day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Very good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">We had in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> two <span class="BUILDING">old age homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">The people couldn’t afford to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they came and lived in those two age -- two <span class="BUILDING">old age homes</span> , supported by the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">We had also a very beautiful <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for orphans, there were a lot of orphans. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">My mother spent most of her time volunteering in those <span class="BUILDING">old age homes</span> , and in the <span class="BUILDING">orphan home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And she derived a lot of satisfaction from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">On top of it, from time to time I used to see her in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , helping my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And -- I was thinking of cooking, but it is not correct because we had a maid that was with us for many, many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And she -- my two sisters and I, when we’re youngsters, were more afraid of her than of my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">She was a strict disciplinarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We were afraid but we liked her very much because we probably realized that she is trying to do her best to -- to make us avoid getting in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">She was a Polish woman, and came during the war asking my parents to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I as -- I tried many, many times to remember why my parents rejected the idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I wish they would have accepted the idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">But there must have been some reason why they rejected the idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">After the war, I met a neighbor of ours who survived in hiding, the age of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">They told me, they were convinced that on the same <span class="DLF">street</span> , my parents are hiding with that lady that worked for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">But it is a mystery to me why they rejected to go into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And sometimes I feel -- I don’t know if I’m justified feeling that way, that they did not want to leave us alone, we were youngsters still. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And sometimes I do believe, especially my father, who could not -- who could not perceive that people are going to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">He somehow looked at the German nation with admiration for their accomplishments, and he couldn’t visualize, probably -- and I am guessing just -- that those people who he is holding in high esteem, who gave us Beethoven and Bach and Dieter and Schiller and Mendelssohn, are capable of committing such crimes, such heinous crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And he felt the war will end and on the [indecipherable] but I’m guessing, just. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">But he -- if he will go into hiding and we be discovered, he’Il be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Am I sure about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="200">No, I’m not. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">But I was thinking many times about it, and those thoughts crossed my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I wish they would have listened to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">She was a wonderful woman, but it’s water over the <span class="DLF">dam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">It happened, and --

<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  We -- I mean, my sisters and I were communicating in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">But my father was a Yiddishist, and there was a newspaper in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> by the name of Hient, on a very, very high level. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I always compare it with the New York Times today. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And we were getting that paper every day, a Yiddish paper, and if during the luncheon my two sisters and I did not know what a very famous journalist was writing today in the paper -- his name was Margoshis, my father used to be very, very upset with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And he enjoyed having those discussions in that -- at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> in the Yiddish language. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">There is [indecipherable] something that I will never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">My youngest sister, before going in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for lunch was telling around to me always, Sigmund, did you read Margoshis’ column today? </span><span class="sentence" id="217">You told me what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Sorry.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">We were glued to the radios, listening to his speeches, and we were frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">But at the same time I do remember that there was a feeling among a lot of people that he is talking about it only in order to gain power, and to exercise power. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">But perhaps it’s empty talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And still we were frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Now of course, on the first of September 1939, when they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , we immediately realized that it is not just talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">There were two events the first two days of -- after they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that I will never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">One were a family by the name of Schlesinger, father and two sons, running to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> to rescue the Torah scrolls -- from the burning <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , the Germans put fire on -- on it -- burned the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">They were able to run in and bring out two Torahs. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">When they emerged from the burning <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , the Nazis shot them on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">That was one event that of course frightened us. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">The second, han -- in hindsight, it was a policy probably, to frighten the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">On the second or third, or fourth day, and I don’t remember any more, they came to -- to -- they entered <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and took out some leaders. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And I don’t remember -- remember today how many, but must have been at least five or six, and hanged them in the middle of the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">For nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">For the fact that they were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">That frightened us quite a bit, quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">The people were really naive in ’39. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">They lived during the first World War, and they felt it’s going to be a static war. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And what my parents did is to move part of the business to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> by the name of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jarolsitsa</span> around 30 or 40 kilometers from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , believing that the war will not -- that the Germans will not come as far, and they will survive and return. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Of course, it turned out to be an illusion, and my sisters and I were -- were in the -- together with my parents in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , that all of a sudden you realize that the ger -- Germans are moving very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And the young people were trying to hitchhike and go east after learning that the Soviet Union have entered the war, and occupying east of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">We strongly believed that we can survive there. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I was one of them, and my sisters did not join me. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Again, I was thinking why, why did it happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And then I remember -- I -- I remembered that -- that in all those seven or eight or nine days that it took me to hitchhike to <span class="REGION">eastern Poland</span> to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , I don’t remember seeing on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> -- the <span class="DLF">roads</span> were crowded -- too many young ladies, too many young women walking and trying to hitchhike and -- to the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I don’t have really a good answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I don’t know why, but those were the facts.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="320">ANSWER:  As a matter of fact it did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Life all of a sudden became semi-normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">The Germans putting men, they called them the [indecipherable] who was now [indecipherable] together with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Not giving anything to us, not -- being guided by my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And we -- life became semi- normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">We were walking the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I am not sure that I remember if our youth group met. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I had doubts about -- I have doubts about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">But people worked, as I told you in those <span class="BUILDING">defense factories</span> , and the illusion that we will survive the war became much stronger. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">That was 1940 - "41. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And furthermore, young people were -- were taken away by the Germans to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And here the -- the image of the man who was in charge of all those communities, all those Jewish communities, a man by the name of Merin, M-e-r-i-n -- perhaps was a visionary. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Perhaps in this -- that feeling came to me only after the war, because during war I was very unhappy with the fact that he is cooperating with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">But he understood that people who work are being sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to help in their defense industry, may have a much better chance than others. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Even though I remember discussions in our groups at that time, quoting a very fa -- very, very famous saying of the philo -- Jewish philosopher Maimonides, that if the enemy comes, and he is asking to hand him o -- hand them over one person that they are going to kill, the community should never accept it. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Yes, we should all -- all of us should go. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">But Merin felt -- felt differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">He felt on the contrary that this cooperation with the Germans and imbu -- imbued young people -- not imbued them, but forcing young people to -- to accept the fact that they are going to be deported, and they are going to be working in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , was perhaps a very good idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Most of them, most of them survived the war. [</span><span class="sentence" id="339">indecipherable] the war, we young people couldn’t accept his decisions of cooperation with the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">On the other hand, again in hindsight, they had -- if he would not have, the Germans would have taken over everything and massacred us, like they did later on when they invaded the Soviet Union in June of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">They came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and just took out people and killed them, massacred. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And maybe we avoided that fate. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">But of course, that he will found that he has a good relationship with the Gestapo, and he can do many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">But again, misleading people. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">He couldn’t -- yes, he could get somebody out of a transport to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but he was really fulfilling their wishes. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">If he had not have done it, would there be other people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> who would have taken over the function? </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Perhaps. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I don’t condemn him any more like I used to during the war, and immediately after the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">He fulfilled a certain function in the life of the Jewish people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bendezin</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sosnowiec</span> and [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  You -- you’re talking about Moshe Merin?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  He was not a very highly respected person before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I don’t remember anything about his family, but I know that he was not among the people who gained the respect of others. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">How he emerged as a leader in 1939 is to me a mystery. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Maybe there are others who lived closer to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Maybe they know the answers. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I am unable to remember and tell you why he emerged as a leader of the Jewish [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">He was not elected, of course, there were no elections. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Something must have happened that the Germans either agreed or appointed him to be the head of the Jewish [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Not only the Jewish community in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sosnowiec</span> , it was this -- it had a -- probably the same [indecipherable] we had probably between 30 or 31,000 Jews and next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> [indecipherable] other small surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">He became the leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="365">I have no answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">QUESTION:  Can you talk -- we’re talking a little bit about their being discussion within the community and some people felt that Moshe Merin was -- was collaborating, cooperating with the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">What did people who disagreed with what he was doing, what did they think should be done? </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And then of course, what did you think? </span><span class="sentence" id="369">You disapproved at that time of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">What did you think he should be doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">ANSWER:  What he should be doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">QUESTION:  Well, you spoke about disagreeing with the fact that he cooperated in some ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">QUESTION:  In many ways, with the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">QUESTION:  What -- what did you think he should have done instead?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">ANSWER:  He couldn’t do anything instead. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I suppose that, as I said before, they would have found another man, another substitution to making [indecipherable] and cooperate with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">You know, I used an expression that I learned someplace, that Moshe Merin and we are confronted with choiceless choices. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">There was no way to -- to change anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">We had no choices. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And again, I do believe that -- that his -- his cooperation saved a certain number of Jewish people who were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">There is nothing, no justification for cooperating with the Germans, and preparing lists of people that are going to be taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">No, it is not. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">But he may have thought, as I said before, that we are going to be exposed to massacres, that nobody will survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Those are feelings that I had after the war, not during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">There were other leaders in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that took upon themselves to cooperate and save. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Perhaps under the illusion that time is -- will be on our side, if we will drag it out, the war will come to an end. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Of course, that was an e -- just an illusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">That’s illusion, and before the war, when we listened to Hitler, I thought it’s just talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">It was not just talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">He meant tt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">QUESTION:  Did you ever meet Moshe Merin or hear him speak?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">When you say meet, I hope you’re not implying that I was sitting down with him and having a discussion, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">But I met him, perhaps several times, when he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and was speaking and again everything -- people to follow him and to leave and be -- to accept the fact that they’re going to be shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and convincing -- trying to convince people that that is -- that they will survive, they will have -- they will work under completely different conditions, that they -- they will not die out of hunger or disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">But I was never involved in any- in any conversations with him.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="401">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  What were they thinking?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">ANSWER:  Not that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Not -- I assume that there were those who believed him, and those who had doubts about what he is saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">But this is natural, it is normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">If a majority believed him, or a minority believed him, who knows? </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Who knows? </span><span class="sentence" id="408">But again, as I said before, it turned out that most of them survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">QUESTION:  Can you describe life at this point in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Tell us a little bit more about how your father’s <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> is run. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">You mentioned a German being there to help him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  Not to help him, he -- h-he -- he -- he was there to help them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">QUESTION:  Your father was there to help the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">QUESTION:  What -- what was the atmosphere in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> like, and again what was daily life like? </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Was there enough food? [</span><span class="sentence" id="417">inaudible]
ANSWER:  I don’t believe that I -- I thought that I was ever hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">How did we get food? </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Yes, there were some <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> open and -- and I do remember that Poles, they come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and send food. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">When I say that my father was there to help them, even though -- even though he was not paid, but I do remember that permit -- perhaps with their permission or with none -- no -- not -- not get- getting their permission, he used to take out from the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> certain things from the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and sell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And that was a blessing, cause we could buy food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">QUESTION:  And when the Germans came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were there any new laws they passed, that insisted that you give them personal items?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">QUESTION:  Do you know if you were present for any of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="425">ANSWER:  If what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">QUESTION:  If -- if -- 1f you experienced any of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER:  Well, they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and after a few weeks everyone had to wear that yellow band and the sign Juden here. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Of course this was already demeaning, and something [indecipherable] and such a state of mind, you are losing your faith, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Your world is sudden start to feel that you are something that is -- has to live on a much lower level. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And, as I told you, we are in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- there’s a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we -- we were very proud of be-belonging to the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">When they came, immediately brought us down completely, taking away our confidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And perhaps [indecipherable] they -- they took away a -- our faith and resistance, even though in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> there was a group of young people who somehow were able to secure a gun or two guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">They killed a German in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Of course, they later, the Germans came in and of course they took most of the young people and killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I’m not sure most, but a certain number of people that they killed on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">That what I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">QUESTION:  You’ve mentioned two situations now of being -- sounded like they were asking people to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and then in this case rounding up people after the resistance attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">How did you escape those two situations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">ANSWER:  First of all, I hope you don’t mind if I will correct something in your statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">QUESTION:  Not at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">ANSWER:  Not asking people to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , deporting people to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I hope you don’t mind --
QUESTION:  Not at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">ANSWER:  -- but I -- I am correcting that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">QUESTION:  Well, let me clarify. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">So at that point when Moshe Merin, it’s -- it’s not a sign up, he’s not -- he’s just justifying. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">He’s not telling people that they should volunteer to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">ANSWER:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">ANSWER:  No, he was the per --
QUESTION:  He’s justifying a certain deportation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION:  Okay, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER:  And preparing the lists of people that should be deported.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  What was your question?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  I-I wanted to know in those two situations, how were you able to avoid, in the first one being chosen, in the second being rounded up perhaps if I’m -- if I’m imagining it --
ANSWER:  Yes, yeah, I avoided it because of the influence of my father, and the fact that I was working on that kibbutz and being protected that way, being healed that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">That was [indecipherable] that I was not deported.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">QUESTION:  Will you tell us a little bit about the influence of your father at that point in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">ANSWER:  Oh, his influence was diminished to a great extent, but he knew the members, all the members of the Judenrat, and he was kept in very high respect, perhaps he avoided, or he was able to -- to convince them not to put me on the list, that somebody else go in -- in my <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I’m sure somebody else went and took my <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Did I think of it at that time? </span><span class="sentence" id="461">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">But after the war, you know, you are going back, you are trying to determine in your own mind what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And I came to the conclusion that somebody else was deported in my <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">It’s not a very comfortable feeling, but again, that expression that I used, choiceless choices, comes to my mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">QUESTION:  At this point -- at this point, is your father -- you’re a young man, 1s your father talking to you in any way about the future or choices that may have to be made? </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Perhaps even a strategy of how to deal with danger, I guess is the best word for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">At this point people are being deported, people are being rounded up, they’re being shot in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Are you and your father having any discussions about what may come for you [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  I don’t remember any specific discussions, but a lot of people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were building hiding places in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> that were really difficult to discover. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And by -- and my father, of course, built such a place in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">No, he build that place of hiding only after they brought us into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">In our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> he did not, but after they brought us into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , he build a place of hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And that was perhaps the best indication how bad the situation is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">QUESTION:  Can you describe where the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was, or how it was hidden?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  The <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- yeah, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was in our <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , and the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> for the -- to the -- to the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> was -- was -- was done in a way to disguise it, how? </span><span class="sentence" id="475">By putting a -- putting a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">credenza</span> , or whatever you call it at that time to hide the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And there were no signs, if I remember correctly that there is a [indecipherable] even if you moved out the -- the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> that was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">At the same time, the Germans learned, especially in <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> of more important people that they build hiding places in there, and they found most of them, or all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">It was again only another illusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">But you have to live with illusions in times like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Life becomes unbearable if you don’t have any illusions. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">We lost faith, we lost confidence, but if you lose illusions too, then -- then you are hopelessly paralyzed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  What do you mean when you say you lost faith?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">ANSWER:  We lost faith in ourselves after they put those yellow bands and wearing that sign Juden. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">It was difficult for us to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">If you are referring to faith as faith in God, I am not sure at that point that we lost faith in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">We lost faith in man, but I am not sure that we lost faith in God, but we lost faith after arriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , completely in God, seeing what is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And there’s a very interesting change of minds among people who arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and were my friends or acquaintances. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Maybe after the war I understood it. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">People who were in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> who I knew were very pious people, very pious people. [</span><span class="sentence" id="490">indecipherable] starting to challenge God, mocking. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Maybe mocking 1s a too strong word. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And on the contrary, my friends who are atheists in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , who belonged as I told you before to that left wing organization and communists -- I’m not sure about communist, but who belo -- belonged to the left wing organizations, and were atheists, all of a sudden became belie -- they became believers. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And again, after analyzing it, I have one answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Here I have an answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">I think that the atheists became more believing, blaming themselves for creating that situation and forcing the wrath of God. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And the other group, the religious group couldn’t understand that God is not interfering. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">They learned in Jewish history that God interfered in many instances in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> or -- or <span class="COUNTRY">Persia</span> , whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Why is He all of a sudden becoming invisible. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Why is he not interfering? </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Seeing small children that are innocent being thrown into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">fire</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">If I am innocent -- if I am guilty, fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">But how can you permit small children being th-thrown into the fire? </span><span class="sentence" id="504">But again, a change happened in me too, later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I realized that without faith in God, or faith in a human -- in entity that 1s -- that is managing the world, it’s very difficult for this, very difficult for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">End of Tape Three Beginning Tape Four
QUESTION:  At some point in all of this, you -- you get married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">QUESTION:  Can you tell us about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">ANSWER:  When I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , I -- perhaps several months later, either it was the second part of 1940, I got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I got married to somebody who was in my class in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and with whom I was very close all those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">We were what you call today sweethearts. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And even though we accepted that we should not bring -- and we should not bring people -- well, you should not raise a family, that -- perhaps that was the expression, to have children, we wanted to get married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">QUESTION:  Why did you -- why did you think that you should not raise a family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">ANSWER:  Because I thought at that point that perhaps there’s an uncertain future, and perhaps also it -- it will be easier to survive without having to shield or protect small kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And we were young, we thought the war would end, and we can have children at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">We felt it’s irresponsible for people getting married to ha -- to try to build a family, build a family into a very uncertain future and having to protect those children, that is no way for us really to protect. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And it is a mistake, a big mistake to raise a family.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="521">QUESTION:  And can you describe your actual wedding, were you able to have a -- a -- a ceremony?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">ANSWER:  The ceremony took place at her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , only family were invited. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Was it a happy ceremony? </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I don’t believe so. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">It was a ceremony with lack of enthusiasm, even though we were deeply in love with each other, but how could you become happy in to the [indecipherable] times when you knew that things are going very, very badly, that who knows if you will survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">So why did we marry? </span><span class="sentence" id="527">We married -- when you are 19 or 20, you are -- and you went out with your future wife for six, seven years, a desire to get married -- the desire to get married is stronger than logic. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Much stronger than logic. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Her parents were pushing, even though my parents were reluctant. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And we got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">I don’t have any regrets. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I was in love with my future wife for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I do believe that I made that -- at that time, the right decision even though my parents were not very happy about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And they participated in the wedding, together with my sisters, and never mentioned anything to anybody that they are uncom -- not that I know of, that they are uncomfortable with the marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">I’m -- I don’t believe that I am -- that I know more about it, or I remember more about it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="554">QUESTION:  So after you read the law and brought it up, who -- who put you in that job?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  My father helped me to put into the job.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="558">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">ANSWER:  I was managing and trying to be fair in distribution. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">It’s not easy to be fair in situations like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Even though I don’t remember being accused of treating people -- one group of people more favorable than the other, I don’t remember being accused of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Was I unfair? </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I am sure that I was trying to be fair.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  When you are saying people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> collaborating with the Germans, I don’t believe that I used that expression before. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">We were talking about Moshe Merin collaborating with Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Were there others? </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Of course there were others. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I --
QUESTION:  I’m talking about someone who might -- might s -- tell a German that you had -- that a person had taken an extra sausage without asking, or inform, or spy on people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">ANSWER:  Yes, unfortunately that happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">There were some who were informing on neighbors, leading some Germans to -- to <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> where they could take more -- take -- take out valuable things. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">This is very -- was very regrettable. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Do you have to be informer to survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I don’t believe so, but there were informers, and not only there were informers, the Germans have insisted on having a police force, a Jewish police force in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And those police officers, whenever there was a day that they were trying to round up people and deport them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or any other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , they were -- that Jewish police force were working with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">This I wish would have never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And again, would it have led to a massacre? </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Could very well be, if they would not have -- if the Jewish police would not have cooperated with them, that could very well be. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">But -- but perhaps, same thing, who am I to judge somebody who has -- who wants to save him and his family? </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Difficult, very difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">QUESTION:  Did you have -- can you tell us when you first heard of the idea of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">ANSWER:  It must have been at the end of ’42 or the beginning of ’43. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">That’s -- again, we heard about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> much earlier, because they have -- the Germans established <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> before they did it in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Maybe because my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was incorporated into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and the others were in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , were the -- where they could -- where there were no publicity. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Even though there were no publicity, nobody really was trying to inform the western world at that time what is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">But the fact that we were incorporated into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> must have been a factor, that we were living to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> only at the end of ’42, and perhaps even ni -- perhaps -- perhaps not in 42, but in °43. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I don’t remember the exact date.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">QUESTION:  So you remember the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> coming towards the end?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">ANSWER:  °43. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Before we were deported to -- before the -- there was a complete liquidation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that took place on August 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">There was no -- there was -- we knew that there are -- that there are qu -- establishing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , and perhaps that one day it would happened in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> too, and it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">But again, I remember people who were -- who were terribly disposed to Merin, saying that he is avoiding it, that he 1s trying to avoid, the he is trying to convince them not to -- not to deport us into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Did he have so much power? </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I doubt it very, very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I doubt it very, very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">But people -- some people believed in his good relationship with the Gestapo and that we can avoid it. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">But the decisions were not of local Gestapo people or even district Gestapo people. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Decisions were made in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="601">They get -- they got the -- got the letter, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="602"><span class="BUILDING">Building</span> has to be a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> by the first of June or whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And they were just fulfilling the wishes of the main authorities in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">So I have doubt that he could influence local authorities to postpone it. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">They would have been probably put into <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> or killed, you know, there was no ob -- not obeying. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Not obeying a decision made in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> would have cost them their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">So I have great doubts that Merin was able to postpone our being deported into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="608">QUESTION:  Can you describe what it wa -- what actually happened when you went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I mean, how much warning were you given, did you just walk out of your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and leave most everything there, your parents --
ANSWER:  Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">QUESTION:  -- did you try to find your parents that day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="611">ANSWER:  No, I don’t remember, but must have been -- has -- had one or two days warnings that we have to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> , and again that Judenrat assigned different <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">It’s extremely crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">We got, I believe, two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> for the entire family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">QUESTION:  So this --
ANSWER:  But on the other hand, and again it’s hindsight -- not hindsight, but thinking about it later on, we may have felt that at that time, ’42, or the beginning of °43, that this is the way we will survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">If they are creating or building <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> , they are not going to take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">annihilation camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And that was a comforting -- comforting th-thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">But again, an 1l-illusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">QUESTION:  So you had heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">annihilation camps</span> at -- you remember hearing about them before you actually went -- went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="619">ANSWER:  I would say that in ’43, we knew, much more than in ’42. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">We knew from emissaries who came to us, warning us that -- that there’s an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and there’s a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , and there’s a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> and they are sent -- shipping those all -- deporting those people those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> and the older people, and the kids and children and women are being immediately sent to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="621">But there was one -- one event. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">One of the people who were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , were able before the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> to jump out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and made it back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And he came back and he was telling everybody that -- what happened, and that we are going to be all of us shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> and that we will not survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">That was a warning that came very late, must have been ’43, maybe June or July of ’43. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">But what could we have done? </span><span class="sentence" id="626">We were dealing -- or living in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with a population who are very hostile to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">When I say the population, I am referring perhaps to about, I don’t know, I will guess 85 - 90 percent of the people very hostile to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">They were taking some money, promising to -- to sell out -- bring out guns, never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">They were denouncing us, pointing out to Germans if they saw somebody who looked like Jewish and was trying to -- to go to -- to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> without that yellow band. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">They -- they had a way of recognizing Jews, and denouncing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">So what could we have done in June, July of 1943? </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Very little Very, very little.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">QUESTION:  You say when you went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that that -- 1t was crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Who at that point were you living with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">ANSWER:  With my --
QUESTION:  In -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , when you went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">ANSWER:  Yes, I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I was living with my wife with my parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">QUESTION:  So then at that point you and your wife did move in with your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And your two sisters were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">QUESTION:  Was your grandfather there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">ANSWER:  No, my grandfather died before the war, and my grandmother died before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="643">QUESTION:  Describe the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> that you had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">ANSWER:  They were in a part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> they call it kamyonka. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Very poor people lived there, very poor people, so you can imagine the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I do believe that we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I do believe that we had to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="648">But as I said before, and that -- I am reinforcing it now in my own mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">It could very well be that we thought at that time that being in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> will shield us of being -- being deported to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">QUESTION:  How were the sleeping arrangements? </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I mean, were -- did your mother and father have one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , or were you in --
ANSWER:  No, I think -- I am not sure that I remember, but somehow we managed to sleep on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">We managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">We did not let our parents sleep on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , but we were probably lying down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and I can’t imagine <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> for so many people in those small <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">QUESTION:  What happened to your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , your <span class="BUILDING">parent’s house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">ANSWER:  Yeah, the German took it over, it was a very nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">The Germans took it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">There was one Polish family living in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , he was a doctor, his name was Bialy, B-1-a -- B-1-a-l-y, with whom I was close. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I used to spend some evenings in the 40’s in his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> discussing -- discussing events. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Was he also removed from that -- from my father’s -- or from our ho -- <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I don’t remember, I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">I only remember that my father gave him -- we had some paintings. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">I’m not sure how valuable those paintings were, there were no -- not Picassos. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">But he gave him some paintings in order to -- in order to preserve them and give it -- give them back to us after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">QUESTION:  Was there anything else that your family did take with them into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="665">What else did your father take?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">ANSWER:  Yes, I am -- yes, we took certain things -- will I be able today to describe them, no, absolutely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Of course we took certain things with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Yes, I do remember that we were wheeling something, and everybody was. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">But what can you take, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="670">You don’t have anyth -- any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> or -- or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to -- to transfer. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">You took something that was -- that you felt -- our parents felt it would be absolutely necessary to have. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Pretty sure it was things like this.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="684">QUESTION:  Really? </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Can you tell us a little bit about that, because --
ANSWER:  Yes, I will tell you, my f -- we celebrated Friday nights with our families. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">They were very happy Friday nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">He observed most of the rituals, all the holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">He observed very s -- very strictly, with one of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">But he -- yes, during the holidays he was going to -- to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , but every Saturday morning, my mother was taking me to my grandfather, who was waiting already on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and leading me to his <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And I will never forget the moment, I'll never -- I loved my grandfather, I loved him very dearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And I will never forget those moments sitting with him and he putting his tallit over my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I was so secure, must have been six or seven or eight years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">I was so secure sitting next to him with that tallit. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">You know, I saw him in the morning, this is very -- sometimes praying, almost by heart, and I said to myself, I'll never be able to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">But the best part was -- and he was -- he was praying the grace after meals. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">There’s one sentence that stuck into my mind when he was pronouncing loudly, I will say it in Hebrew [speaks Hebrew here]. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I was a young boy, and now I’m an old man, but I have never seen a righteous man begging for bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">That was very reassuring. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I di -- always waited for that sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">QUESTION:  So then, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , did you continue to celebrate Fridays?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">ANSWER:  We never gave that up. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">We were a singing family. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I mean singing not professionally, but we all loved to sing, and he loved it and we were singing Friday night until late into the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>

QUESTION:  I need you to think back to this time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">How are people treating each other? </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Are they acting as a community and trying to support each other? </span><span class="sentence" id="722">What were you able to observe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">ANSWER:  I think unfortunately, everybody was living for himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Everybody was trying to survive 1n a situation where survival was very doubtful. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">It was difficult in [indecipherable] to create a feeling of -- of having a common cause. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Any one of us had the one aim, to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I am sure that people today, if they will read all the books and all the diaries will really be -- they will be unable to understand what indeed took place there. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">There’s an impossibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">So, for me to say that there was a sense of a community is wrong; there was no such thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And you may ask the question why. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I told you why. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Everybody lived for himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">We have to understand this. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">You will not be able to really know exactly, or know what was life about in those dreadful times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">QUESTION:  Who did you trust at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">ANSWER:  I trusted my father, and I later discovered that I could trust my instincts. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I discovered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and for certain reasons I did certain things without realizing why I am doing it, but by doing it I survived that moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">So yes, I -- I have trust in my instincts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">QUESTION:  Some of the youth movements 1n your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were actively resisting. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">What -- what did you know about that, and were you ever able to observe any of that activity?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="741">ANSWER:  I was not part of it, so I could not observe it, but I believe I mentioned it before, there was a grou -- small group of people who were able to secure a gun or two, and killed a -- a Nazi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="742">But that was all the extent of it -- there’s -- that’s all we have done, nothing else. [</span><span class="sentence" id="743">indecipherable] can you visualize those -- that -- that situation? </span><span class="sentence" id="744">You cannot. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Impossible. [</span><span class="sentence" id="746">indecipherable] resistance was possible.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="774">QUESTION:  Well, I think it’s interesting because I -- I -- and I wonder if -- if you’d want to explore it a little, that there was a part of you that felt that -- that you were part of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="775">ANSWER:  Iam very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">They were hiding everything, not talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Maybe when I use the word us, to bring guns for us, maybe I thought of them representing us. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I was raised on the belief that we are a very tight community. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And by using the word us, I [indecipherable] to have some conscience, but at the same time I felt probably that they are defending us, or they are work -- or they are fighting for our dignity or something like this.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="784">QUESTION:  The young idealistic kibbutz --
ANSWER:  No, I was not frightened, I was not frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">But young people who shot the German in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were much younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">They were the generation of my youngest sister, very idealistic, very idealistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And what did they think? </span><span class="sentence" id="788">What are you trying to accomplish? </span><span class="sentence" id="789">What did they think would -- they would accomplish by shooting or killing a German? </span><span class="sentence" id="790">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">But [indecipherable] those young people were so -- so strong that they felt that I’m going to give my life, but I’m going to take a Nazi life, too, with me.</span></p>
