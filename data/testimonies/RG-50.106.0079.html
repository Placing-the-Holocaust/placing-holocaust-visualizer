<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  I think I was about four, four and a half, probably.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  And what happened after you fell? </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Do you remember that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  Oh, my mother, you know, came up to comfort me and my grandfather ran out to comfort me. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And what was interesting was, in 1983, when we visited the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for the first time, the people are — who are living in there are descendants from my grandfather’s apprentice. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And, it was the son of the apprentice who was running the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> then and shortly now — shortly, he — he had, before we came, he had turned the business over to his son, who unfortunately though, had a heart attack and died very rec — just recently, shortly before we came. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But back in 1983, when we came in, the November 18, 1997 appre — th-the — my father — grandfather’s apprentice was still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">He was an 0 — very old man, but unfortunately his memory was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">But the — his — his son still remembered my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And he remembered that my grandfather, after we had left, my — the people, the older people — I don’t remember exactly when, but some time shortly after we left, they were — the Jewish people were sent to what was then the Jewish old age home in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">They were all collected, and they were c — there. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And he says he can remember my grandfather coming to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because they didn’t get ve — enough food to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">He would come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there and ask them if he could eat with them, because they were not getting enough food. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And that was pros — as I recall was about 1940 - ’41. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And then after awhile, this man said, your grandfather just didn’t come any more, so we didn’t know what happened, except they had heard that the Jews had been taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And as it turned out, the records now show that they’d been taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I also can remember going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> shortly before we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> year in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> starts right after Easter. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in early summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> briefly, and I can remember that my father was concerned about me and my going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I had to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> to get to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And he rode behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> every day to just observe that nothing would occur. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And then would meet the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> sometime on the way back, when I came back from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">November 18, 1997
QUESTION:  Was it required by the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that you go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Yes, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was too far for me to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">That’s the reason I had to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  And there would be no other way for you to be transported?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Get there, no, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  And did you know that your father was following on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Yes, I did know that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Why didn’t he just get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  Well, I— I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I think he just didn’t want to — to — at first, I Just [indecipherable] about somewhat later. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Initially I think he just didn’t want to get me concerned that he felt that uneasy, that I would have to — that he would have to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  So he was trying to help you be independent?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And it’s also that I wouldn’t have those concerns. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I can remember this — so I only went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> very — a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Maybe, at most two, before we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  What do you remember about the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  I can remember they had a large, open <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">At least it seemed large to me at the time, probably wasn’t that large, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">At this time — the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> is no November 18, 1997 longer there. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">It was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , and — a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish elementary school</span> , which was not uncommon in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they were that — that — there — even before the Nazi times this [indecipherable] there were <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> that were, you know, t — even today they have <span class="BUILDING">parochial school</span> supported by the state, and so that the Jew — the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> were also partly supported by the state. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And I do remember going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> very briefly. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I don’t remember too much, except that I was very unhappy going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">That’s the only time that I was unhappy going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I always liked going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  And what was there that —
ANSWER:  So I must have been some concern.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  What — do you have any memory of what there was about the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that you were feeling unhappy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I’m really not sure why that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Perhaps I had a feeling of the uneasiness of my parents, because by that time my father had been forced to close the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> already, that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Another <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , he had two <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And he only had the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> now in — in the part — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilendorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And I suspect that I felt some of the uneasiness of — that my parents must have had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  Do you remember anything about the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , other than the <span class="DLF">playground</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="117">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  Well, I remember being in the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I don’t remember too much about what occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I remember when we — first day that I was there, I do have one memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Walked into the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> and on the blackboard there was a drawing done in chalk of a — of a little boy and a little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I guess the teacher had done that, I can recall that — seeing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I don’t remember anything really about — else about the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  Do you remember any of the other children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Not really, not really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  And outside of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , did you have playmates?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  Yes, I— well, my cousins lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilendorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">My mother had a si — a sister whose family also lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilendorf</span> , and th — she had three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And so I can remember playing with them, and I’m — don’t particularly remember other people except now, recently we received a letter from someone who had seen the article about our trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> , and she wrote us a letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">She also knew my — my nanny, because her mother, my nanny’s mother, had been a domestic in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and she wrote him the letter that she had sometimes played with me because Hani(ph), who was the — who was the nanny. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And she sent me a picture, a class picture that she had, which had — which included my elder cousin, my oldest cousin Ilsa, who was a classmate of hers. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So she was about three years older than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And then November 18, 1997 she had a brother and sister who were younger than the brother Eric, was about my age, and I can remember playing with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  Now, was she Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  This woman? </span><span class="sentence" id="135">No, she was not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And she wrote to us that she can remember meeting the Kunn(ph) family, that was their name, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> later when she sometimes would go in with her mother after they had been forced to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilendorf</span> , and I guess they were — ma — they — they must have been gathered in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">All the Jews must have been gathered there, and she can remember though, meeting Ilsa on the <span class="DLF">street</span> sometimes for a short period of time during — I guess in the early 40s. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So she had that memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So she sent me a very nice letter, and she had spoken with me, and she thought I might be interested in having that picture of my — of my cousin, which of course we were very interested in seeing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Was your family religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  No, no, my family was not — the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> were what we would call in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , Reform. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And the — my — my father’s family had been more religious, although my father was not particularly religious, although we would — we went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And — but we would have — we — the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was too far to walk, so we would have to drive there. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So no, the — this — the — the Jew — the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> — there were very few religious Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> , most of them were November 18, 1997 Reform. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And then — that community had been there for quite some time, certainly since the middle of the 18" century.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  Do you remember anything specific about the closing in of the Nazis when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Not — no, I don’t remember it particularly from firsthand experiences except my — of course, my parents talked about it from time to time later on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  But you don’t remember hearing them talk about it when you were a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  I—no, no, I don’t remember hearing it firsthand. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I do remember our trip when we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I can remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I can remember going to say goodbye to my grandmother, my father’s mother, who was still living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span> at that time, and taking the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> down there to say goodbye to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  What was your understanding at the time of why you and your parents were leaving, and not your grandparents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  I don’t know that I — I had that particular understanding of — at — at that age, of why that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Of course later my parents told me that these people, they didn’t want to go along, they thought, you know, things would be all right, and they were old people, and they felt nothing would happen to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And so I don’t particularly know, except I do know my parents spoke about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">My father tried very hard to get them to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And by the time, of course, they wanted to leave, it was too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">We November 18, 1997 were in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> by then, of course, but — and even when we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in 1938, it was too late for them to leave, they couldn’t get out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  And do you remember what you were told about the leaving?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  No, not really firsthand, I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Later, of course, I learned, you know, about it from my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And I heard from Hani(ph), Hani(ph) Dover, the — my nanny, she told us when — on this last visit sh-she can remember that when my father decided to leave, telling them that he was leaving because there was no future in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for his son and his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So my father decided to leave in 19 — actually, he told us that he wanted to leave already in 1933, but it took him three year — almost three years to get it together and to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">At that time we couldn’t come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because we had no family here. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Later, we were —Ith—my uncle, my father’s brother came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> through his wife’s family and that’s how we came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> then, through my aunt’s family, who were not Jewish, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They provided an affidavit for my aunt’s family and — and two of her sisters, and their family, and for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Which was quite something to do, because giving an affidavit meant you were taking a responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  So you left for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in 1936?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="362">ANSWER:  The <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> didn’t have any particular — that much in the way of children’s activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">We had other activities through, you know, thr-through the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I made other friends in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and so they — they weren’t necessarily really connected with the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="367">ANSWER:  Yes, I can remember that very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Of course, it wasn’t as elaborate an affair as Bar Mitzvahs are today. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">First of all, it wasn’t customary then, and beside my parents weren’t going to spend that kind of money on a Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">But I can remember friends and family ad — coming to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and my parents had a kiddush, and — and then a meal for the family afterwards in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>

QUESTION:  — tinuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Kurt Pauly, tape number one, side B. Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">ANSWER:  Okay, because of the difficult economic conditions when we first came, and particularly before my father got a good job as a cook, my mother also went out to work as a domestic on a day — day — daily basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And I can remember going to some of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> where she was working when I got out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , so that I wouldn’t be at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And she did that for some years to help supplement my father’s income. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">As well as, again, renting out — we took a very large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where my uncle lived, and my parents rented out two of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> to help pay for their expenses as well at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And those were rented out for quite a few years until things got a little better and we no longer needed to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I can remember making friends with a — with the people who — who rented the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , and they stayed for quite awhile, so they must have been fairly happy living with my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">So that we had an elderly lady there I remember, a Mrs. Scholl(ph), who was an American woman who I guess was re — living as — she was widowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And she always told me her husband had been a drummer boy in the Civil War. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And we had another woman, a Mrs. Stern, who was an immigrant. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And she was a November 18, 1997 rather — she was not — later on she got rather sickly, and unfortunately — and left because of illness. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And we made friends with her family as well; she had a son. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And actually my parents got to be very friendly with them — with those people as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">They became more than just boarders, they be — sort of became friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And of course later things got better, my parents didn’t have to rent out <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">But of course as a child I never felt particularly deprived or poor because I was — we were, you know, at least comfortable, and I — I guess people around me didn’t have any more than we had, so —
QUESTION:  You mean your friends at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">ANSWER:  Friends, right, friends at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and people that my parents knew that I came to contact with. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">So I guess even at the beginning, although my parents had a very hard time economically, didn’t seem to make that much of a problem for me initially.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">QUESTION:  Do you remember having any awareness at that time of what was going on in the rest of world?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">ANSWER:  Yes, of course, and as — as I — as I grew older, I can remember, well, when the war started, 1939, and my parents [indecipherable] of course, at that time, and their concerns with the people that they had left in Europe, their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And I can — my mother was, of course — my mother was a somewhat of a di — rather depressed personality, and that didn’t get any better as she aged. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">But I can remember that they November 18, 1997 had a great deal of concerns about people they left behind, their parents and their families.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">QUESTION:  And how did that affect you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">ANSWER:  Well, not so much directly when you’re a child, that sort of — you know, it’s sort of there, but it — 1t doesn’t have that much impact on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Although I ca — I could remember my grandparents and I — I remember their concern. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">So some of those concerns did rub off on me, but as a child I — 1t — you don’t feel any responsibility for it, so — but I can remember the war going on, and then of course, I can remember distinctly when — when Pearl Harbor occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">That was on that Sunday, because I had gone with my father on that Sunday to — to see a new <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> that they were — that the — that thas — those people were opening, people that my father worked for, and he wanted to check out, see how it’s com — was coming along. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And so that Sunday we took a trip to the new <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , which was out in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And when we came back there was all this hubbub and people talking and telling us that Pearl Harbor had been attacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So I can remember that very distinctly. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Of course, during the war then, of course, I can remember — well, we had rationing, so that was a problem of sorts, for everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And of course my — you know, not knowing how long the war would last, I guess my parents already began to have some concerns about this happening — their son perhaps drafted at November 18, 1997 some time into the war, although that didn’t occur at that time, although later I was drafted during the Korean War. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">But then it’s — but I was going to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and I enjoyed going to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> very much [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">In fact, I enjoyed going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> period in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="411">It was a very good experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">QUESTION:  What did you like about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">ANSWER:  I just enjoyed learning. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I was a good student and I enjoyed it and I — the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were challenging and — and I just enjoyed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">The <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> I went to — well, actually it was a combination junior high — <span class="BUILDING">high</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">It was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> — although a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , it was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> you had to enter by competitive exam. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And, you know, three years of Latin were still required. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And so I can remember the te — the Latin teacher telling us how fortunate we lu — we were that two years of Greek were no longer required. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">But it was a good <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I enjoyed going there. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Even though it was a good walk to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but —
QUESTION:  So you enjoyed the academic life.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="423">QUESTION:  — extracurricular part? </span><span class="sentence" id="424">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  We enjoyed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I went with my friends and although not all of my friends then went to that particular <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , some of them went to one of the other <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I enjoyed — I enjoyed going to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and you know, being a teenager. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I also helped my parents later in the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> which they opened up, and I would work there after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and on weekends, helping out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  So did that cut into your social time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">ANSWER:  A little bit, but not too badly, not too badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">My parents were understanding and th-they didn’t want me to work all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">So I don’t remember that that was a particular problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  Now how was it for you as far as being a German Jewish immigrant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">ANSWER:  Well, bec — we were surrounded by a lot of people in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And so it wasn’t a particular problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  Did you feel discrimination?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  No, no, I can’t remember feeling any discrimination at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">It was — it was a very — basically a—a pretty good time, except the problems that my parents had then later with — when they learned when the war was over and they got indications of what had happened to their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Of course I remember that, that was — those were terrible times for my parents, and my mother —
QUESTION:  Talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  Well, she cried a great deal about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Of course, she cried very easily because she — she was a somewhat depressed person. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">But I’m sure that there were — you know, the — there were certainly very good reasons there to cry about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And when she — she had always hoped that perhaps somebody would have survived the war, besides of — her brother, of course, had survived in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">But that perhaps some of her nieces and nephews, these people — these children that I played with in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilendorf</span> had survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">But sh — my — my — my oldest cousin Ilsa was a — a great favorite of my mother, and she always had some hope that perhaps one of the children had survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">But that was not to be, and later we found out when we checked the records, particularly here at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , there were indications that all of them had been — you know, all of them had perished in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And of course, my mother, not — and of course my father’s family as well; he had the sister, and his mother and well, he had several sisters and their f — and all those people also perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So that was a terrible, you know, feeling for my parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">QUESTION:  And how was it for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">ANSWER:  Well, you know, children don’t in-internalize that as much. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And it — although I knew, you know, it was — it was bad, it — the impact on me was not as great because I had been so young when we left, and so my memories of these people were rather limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I mean, it was very, very st — you know, it — I mean, some of that November 18, 1997 unhappiness obviously rubbed off on me and — but — and then by that time I was old enough to realize what that meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">But — but that — it was, of course, much more traumatic for my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Very traumatic for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And — and of course, my uncle’s family, as well, my aunt’s family. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">They also, of course, lost a lot of people in the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">QUESTION:  So at the end of the war you would have been 15 — 16 when your parents found out —
ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes, yes, that’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So then, in the meantime, m-my father had started this <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> with an aqua — with a f — with a — an acquaintance, but they didn’t get along too well, as partners frequently do. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And my father decided then to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And he sold his interest to his partner, and he had had friends from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> that had moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , and started a <span class="DLF">poultry farm</span> during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And th-they were always in touch with the — with these people, they were close friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And they convinced them to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> and also start a <span class="DLF">poultry farm</span> , which turned out to be a big mistake because although during the war those <span class="DLF">farms</span> made a lot of business, after the war that business really faded. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">They couldn’t compete with the large <span class="DLF">farms</span> in the <span class="REGION">Midwest</span> and on the eastern shore of <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">So unfortunately that was — turned out to be a big November 18, 1997 mistake for — for my parents, although they made the best of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Unfortunately my father died very young, at 62, of cancer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">QUESTION:  That would have been how long ago?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">ANSWER:  And that was in 1957, shortly before I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">What happened was, in 1951, I was — see, I — we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> , that sort of — I guess that — there was a certain upheaval there f— and — and th — I could —
QUESTION:  Now the year you left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">ANSWER:  Was 48.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="469">QUESTION:  °48. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">So you had graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">ANSWER:  I just graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">QUESTION:  Was that part of the timing that they wanted to —
ANSWER:  Yes, probably.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">QUESTION:  — stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> so you could graduate?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  Yes, I think that was probably part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I graduated in ’48, and then my parents moved there. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">But tha-that was a bit of an upheaval for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And as a result, if I'd stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> , I’m sure I would have just gone to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Cincinnati</span> right then and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">But because of that upheaval, I — moving to <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , I didn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> at that time, and I was a little confused about what I wanted to do, as teenagers frequently are. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And what happened was, I got a job in November 18, 1997 Vineland, with the Vineland newspaper, the Vineland Times Journal as a sort of a —arunner, a boy, you know, in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and I would run errands and take out proofs of ads to advertisers to get their approval, and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And did that for a while, and then of course in 1951, I was drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">It was the Korean War, and that was a quite traumatic for my parents, that —
QUESTION:  Now, bef — before that, in the first few years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> , had you sort of expected that you would continue in that direction, or did you think about going to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> at some point —
ANSWER:  I did think about it, but I— I — I — it — because of the move perhaps, and — and then the other thing was, my parents found, as I said, the business, the — the — the poultry business got — eggs business got to be rather poor, and they had a great deal of difficulty making ends meet, so I went — decide well, I can just go out to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">That was probably part of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">QUESTION:  So you felt you had to help support the family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">ANSWER:  Well, at least support myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">So I did that, and then, as I say, I was drafted in 1951, and —
QUESTION:  How did you feel about being drafted?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">ANSWER:  Well, it sort of gave me a focus, cause now I had — had no choi — I knew what I was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And although my parents of course, were very concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I mean, we November 18, 1997 lost all these people in the war, and now their only son was going into the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And what happened was, I was sent to <span class="REGION">Arkansas</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Chaffee</span> for my — for my basic training. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And decided to sign up for OCS, Officers’ Candidate School. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Took the test for OCS and was admitted to a class which was to start about six weeks after my basic training was to be completed. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">So in the meantime, I was sent to what was called <span class="BUILDING">leadership school</span> , which was really for — a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for non-commissioned officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">But since I had the six weeks, they had to do something with me, so they sent me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And I was in —I had an accident, training accident and — and very serious foot — fracture of my foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">What happened was the the trails of the 105 Howitzers — this was an artillery base, and we were ar — taking artillery training. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And [| had an accident with a 105 Howitzer, which almost cut off my foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">But fortunately it didn’t, but 1t was a serious fracture, and I was sent to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And that was in May of 1952, and was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> through the following January. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">So by that time, I no longer had enough time to be sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">You had to have a ba —at least a year of remaining service to be sent overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So I didn’t have that time any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And so I was kept at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> as a clerk. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">They had to assign me somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And spent the rest of my time as a clerk 1n the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and was discharged in November of 1953.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">QUESTION:  What happened to your relationship with your parents during this — November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  Well my parents, you know, once they realized that the accident was not that — well, it was serious, but it certainly wasn’t fatal, and fortunately the surgery was very successful on my foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And although I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> a good deal of the time, my parents, in effect, had the s — had — felt a sense of relief that I wasn’t going to be sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And in fact, I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a good deal of time because of my injury. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">After the surgery and a brief rehabilitation in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , they sent me on a 30 day leave to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , just waiting for this thing to heal. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I came back, they changed the cast and took out the pins from my foot, sent me on another 30 day leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on three 30 day leaves and one 14 day leave before I got out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">So I had to — and then, of course, I spent the rest of my time in <span class="REGION">Arkansas</span> as a clerk in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Then when I got out of — out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , of course I had the ben — or — or out of the service, I got the benefits of the G.I.

<p><span class="sentence" id="528">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I was still in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when I met Jill. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">We were introduced by a mutual friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">At first we — the first time he tried to get us together, of course, neither one of us could manage to get together. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">But he wouldn’t give up, and a year and a half later, he tried again, and this time we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And well, eventually I decided to — we decided to get married and we did get married just shortly before I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Unfortunately, my father at that time got sick, in the summer of 1957. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And we married in the — December of 1957, so my father was dead by the time we married, unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">But he did know Jill, and he did know we were intending to get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And I graduated in 1958. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Now that was difficult for my mother, November 18, 1997 because now she was widowed and she felt very un — well, she just felt kind of lost, and she — she felt she couldn’t live alone, so we had some difficulty along those <span class="DLF">lines</span> , and at first — which was, I think, a big mistake, anlis — at least initially on our part, of course, she lived with us briefly, after we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">I moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> for — because I got a job there with one of the large — big eight accounting firms. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Was called Touche, Niven, Bailey and Smart, now it’s part of Deloitte Touche. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">So — but eventually my mother — we [indecipherable] to put her into an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> of her own, and we were nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">In fact, it was in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived, initially.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">QUESTION:  And were you supporting her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">ANSWER:  No, she was able to support herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">She had, between Social Security and her — what — what money she — she had, she was able to support herself so we didn’t have to support her. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And —
QUESTION:  But did you have to continue to give her a lot of emotional support?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">A great deal of emotional support. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And I must say, my wife was — was very good with that, although it was very difficult for us, Jill really handled it very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">QUESTION:  Now, your wife —
ANSWER:  She did a great deal for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">November 18, 1997
QUESTION:  — your wife is a survivor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">ANSWER:  My wife is also a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Her family left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1939, very late, but was able to leave, and move to — go to <span class="COUNTRY">Kenya</span> , <span class="REGION">East Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="554">That’s a long story on — of its own, but they were very fortunate because the — her — her immediate family and uncles, aunts and cousins, quite a few of them — and in fact, even two grandparents, her father’s parents, and her mother’s mother, also left with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">QUESTION:  Do you think your attraction for each other had something to do with both of you being survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">ANSWER:  I think so, I think so, although we didn’t think of ourselves as survivors at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">That term wasn’t really something that we applied to ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I think so, because we had very common similar backgrounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">It’s — as it turned out, Jill came from a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that was very close to where I was born, although my — our parents didn’t know each other in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">QUESTION:  But you had that in common.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="561">ANSWER:  We did, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">But now, her family was Orthodox, and over time I guess I sort of swung in that direction, as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">You mean, over time after you were married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER:  After we were married, yes, after we were married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">QUESTION:  And so you consider yourself Orthodox now? </span><span class="sentence" id="567">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  Yes, yes, I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">But we were able to — to handle my mother’s problems, although that wasn’t easy at first, but gradually she adjusted more to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">But my — Jill gave her a lot of support and I gave her support, although I — I was working rather hard and Jill, after we had children, didn’t work, so she had some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And then living, at least initially in the same <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> as we, my — so we were very — you know, had — were able to — to give my mother a great deal of support.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">QUESTION:  And when were your children born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER:  Our children — my son is 32, and my daughter is 30. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">They were adopted. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">My wife had several miscarriages, and we were never — we never had children of our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">So we decided after the third miscarriage, to adopt children, which we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  And what was that experience like for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  Well, that was a really very — it’s emotionally a difficult experience, but we — we decided that we wanted to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And we adopted them through the <span class="BUILDING">Louise Wise Agency</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And that was quite an experience in itself, going through that procedure. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">But I must say they — they were supportive because they saw we were sincere and they felt that we would make good parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And we adopted our son then when he was — well, he was about three months old. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And so then short — then three years later we decided maybe we should try for another adoption, which was very unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">The agency did not give out a lot of second children. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">They had just November 18, 1997 started a program — in fact, initially, when we adopted our son, they gave out no second children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="585">QUESTION:  Was that because they didn’t have enough children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">ANSWER:  And then they, somewhere during that time period, apparently, they started a program for giving out second children. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">They felt that perhaps it might be good for the children, that they would have siblings, or go to a family, not be an only child. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">So they started a program to place second children, and we were able to get into that program. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And then we adopted my daughter about three years after my son. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And she again was about three months old when we adopted her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="593">QUESTION:  And were they Jewish babies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> at that time, the law was that you — they — the children could only be placed in <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> of the religion of their mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">So the agency could only place Jewish children, and it could only place them in <span class="BUILDING">Jewish homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Except that there was one exce — an interesting exception. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">There was a program for Native Americans adoption. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">You c — the law did not apply to Native Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And they also had a program for placing Native American children. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">It was a rather small November 18, 1997 program. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">We never got — did adopt a Native American child. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">But that was the only exception at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">QUESTION:  Would that have been your choice, to adopt Jewish babies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">ANSWER:  Not necessarily, because we — they could have become Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">So that — it just worked out that way because when we went — the agents — had we not been able to adopt through the <span class="BUILDING">agency</span> , we probably would have tried some other means, but it all worked out very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">So — and — so then after we adopted my daughter — well, first of all, the agency required that you have a separate <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for each of the children, that was one of the conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">We only had a thr — <span class="INT_SPACE">two bedroom apartment</span> , and my son was already in the <span class="INT_SPACE">second bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So we — we told the agency we would get a sec — a third — another <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> for the — for — for my daughter eventually, so we looked for a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="610">So on — on the condition that we would, you know, provide a second <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> for the — my daughter, they placed my daughter with us on — she was still in the — we were still in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">But what we did was we made a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> out of a <span class="INT_SPACE">dinette area</span> , temporarily, for my daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And somewhere after that we — we did move into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and then we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> for each child. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And meanwhile I was working, and I worked for five years for a public accounting firm, Touche, and — whose name changed several times while I was working for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">But by th — when I left they were called Touche November 18, 1997 Ross. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And after about five years I went with a company called Mark Marietta(ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , at the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">It was shortly after the company was formed, it was a merger of two other companies, that’s — is frequently the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And I was with them until I retired really, in 19 — at the age of 62, in 1992.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">QUESTION:  Now, how did you get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="619">ANSWER:  Ah yes, how did we get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">In the meantime, was oh, in the early 70s, my mother began to develop signs of dementia. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">So we — 1n the — in the meantime, she had moved out of her — the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we lived in, and taken an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in a — in — in — in a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that was built for senior citizen resident, as a <span class="BUILDING">senior citizen residence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">She was very happy there. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">It was not too far from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">But while she was there she began to develop signs of dementia. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And at the suggestion of her doctors and based on our own observations we decided that she probably should go into a — some kind of a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And after looking around very long and hard, we found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in upstate New York, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Rochelle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="627">There was a very good <span class="BUILDING">Jewish philanthropic home</span> there, which is still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And we decided of all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> we saw, this was the most approp — the best and most appropriate, and they accepted my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And this was in 1974, and two — oh, maybe two weeks after they had accepted my mother, the company said oh, by the way, we’re moving the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bethesda</span> , <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Now we knew that November 18, 1997 they were considering moving, but it — but the actual knowledge that the move was going to take place occurred just as my mother had been accepted in this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="631">So we said, well, can’t put my mother there, we’ll have to try to place her down here. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">We decided to move down here, that was [indecipherable] company [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">As it turned out, we couldn’t place my mother in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">We tried some alternatives for her, but it did not work out and we went back to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Rochelle</span> and said, would they accept my mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="635">We couldn’t place her in the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew home</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">They had — they wouldn’t accept her, they didn’t have the facilities, she was an out-of-stater, so forth and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And they said well, if she’s in no worse condition that she was when we accepted her, we’ll take her. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And of course, she was in worse condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Except we were fortunate, the one day we took her up there she had a very good day. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I fl— we flew — I flew up with her, and she had a great day, and they said fine, she’s no worse than she was then, and they took her in. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And although we felt very unhappy about placing my mother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Rochelle</span> , when we were here with our family, there was — there seemed to be no alternative. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">We decided to do that and she lived there for about four years before she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And we went up there roughly almost once a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">One of us would go, either I would go or Jill would go, on a — usually on a Sunday to see my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And of course, her condition deteriorated, so after awhile she really didn’t even November 18, 1997 know us any more, which 1s typical for that condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">But — so we took someone to help, we hired someone to help, you know, take — supplement the care that she was getting in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And that worked out reasonably well in terms of her condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And then, of course, eventually she died, after about four years in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">QUESTION:  That was when?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">ANSWER:  Well, let’s see, that was — we moved here in ’74, it was about ’70 [indecipherable] ’77. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Meanwhile, of course, we were here with our children, and I was continuing my work with the company. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And Jill, when the children grew up decided she wanted to do something again, and she went, started selling real estate. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">We had — the children grew up, that was a mixed bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">They had very bad teenage years, and my daughter was the most difficult child. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">She had a terrible teenage time. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">I won’t go into all the details, but she ran away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">We finally had to — finally her condition got to be so bad, we hospitalized her briefly. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And that helped her a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">That really helped her. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">She was hospitalized almost a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">QUESTION:  That was a tough time for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">ANSWER:  It was a very tough time for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And meanwhile my son, although he was not as rebellious as my daughter, or as difficult as my daughter, was also having a rather difficult teenage time. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">But my daughter somehow managed, as a result of the hospitalization, to pull herself together and her condition improved. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And although it November 18, 1997 was far from perfect, nevertheless now she is married, and she has a s — husband, and she has two lovely children, and — and although she never made it to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , she did graduate <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and they’re living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And my son did get through — finally did go through the University of penns — of Maryland. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And he’s turned out to be a very nice, responsible individual, and we’re very close to both children. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And my son lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> with his family, he also has two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And we — in fact, his little boy was just born two weeks ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">QUESTION:  So you’re a grandfather again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">ANSWER:  A grandfather four times now. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And so he has a little girl, as not — just under two, and a little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And my daughter also has a little girl and a little boy we’re very close to. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And they’re lovely children. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">So we enjoy being grandparents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">We have to turn the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">End of Tape One, Side B November 18, 1997 Beginning Tape Two, Side A
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Kurt Pauly, conducted by Margaret Garrett on November 18, 1997, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Silver Spring</span> , Maryland. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Tape number two, side A. Mr. Pauly, could you talk about your beginning to volunteer at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I retired in 1992, and at that time Jill was still selling real estate, but we decided to look for something to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And we had heard about the training program for the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So we applied, thinking that with our background, it was something we would be very interested in. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And as that turned out to be the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">We went and —
QUESTION:  You say, with your background, did you have some feelings about —
ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">QUESTION:  — being there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">ANSWER:  Yes, we did, because of all the people that both of us had lost in the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And over the years, you know, you — you — as you get older, then you — you’re interested in what happened in the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And so we had — we had to s — oh, we’d become more informed about what had happened to our families that — during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And so we felt that this was something we really wanted to do because of our November 18, 1997 experiences in the — and what had happened to our families. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">We felt that the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> was a good memorial, and — and a — and — and a — very important as a place of learning, and we still feel that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And people can — should learn about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">So when we — after our interviews, and when we started the training program, we felt we, you know, we really had done the right thing and we would — we would — we would want to do the kind of work that the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> could provide US.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="694">QUESTION:  What contributed to your being more sure that that was what you wanted to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">ANSWER:  Well, as we saw what the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> was, and how it was going about its mission as a—a place of learning, and a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where people could come to see what had occurred, particularly people who might not otherwise have been able to have that experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">We felt that that was a very fitting kind of activity for us, sort of a — sort of a memorial of our own for the people that we had lost in the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And I think we still feel that way about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">So we went — visitor services is — 1s the work that we ended up doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And now Jill though, has left the — at least temporarily the visitor services to work for the — work for Marty Goldman in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And I still continue with the visitor services.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="707">QUESTION:  And how often do you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">ANSWER:  We go 1n, well, once a week, on Thursday afternoons is our time. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">And I must say, our group had been very stable. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Almost all of those — almost all of those volunteers are people who started with us when the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> opened, and have been coming on Thursday afternoons since the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> opened.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="716">QUESTION:  Do you participate in other <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> activities? </span><span class="sentence" id="717">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  Not too much, because we have other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">But well, when they have, you know, meetings and other things, sometimes we go. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">We go sometimes to — occasionally some of the classes, although we haven’t gone to too many of them, because they’re in the evening and — and we’re tired on Thursday afternoons and — although occasionally we go in for something special, that we’re particularly interested in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">QUESTION:  So the group of volunteers on thirdy — Thursday afternoon has remained fairly stable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">ANSWER:  Very stable there, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">QUESTION:  And you’ve gotten to know the others?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes, we’re friendly with them, sort of on a — on a volunteer basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">We don’t really get together with them otherwise, socially, but — but we all feel very close to each other as volunteers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">QUESTION:  And do you feel that the volunteers work pretty well together, or that sometimes there are frictions and tensions and —
ANSWER:  No, we — we — we seem to be a very homogeneous or at least a very — not necessarily homogeneous group, but we seem to get along very well together, and we haven’t had any great co — any conflicts with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">We — we — we are all very happy together. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">November 18, 1997
QUESTION:  [sneezes] Excuse me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">ANSWER:  Bless you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">QUESTION:  Are any of the other people in the group survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="731">QUESTION:  So you had to stop and think about that —
ANSWER:  Yes, ’'m-— I’m close — there’s one woman who comes whose husband was a survivor, but she’s the only one that’s close.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">QUESTION:  And do you feel different from the others in that you are a survivor and they are not, or do they see you differently?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">ANSWER:  I don’t know if we see each other that wa — well, obviously we’ve had some different experiences, but because we were child survivors and also because we were not really directly in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> we weren’t in the — in the Holocaust in that sense, we don’t quite have the same experiences that the people who went through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> had. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Those survivors, I think we feel very different than they do. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">So we — we probably don’t feel as different as these other volunteers, although we do feel somewhat different because of — of our experiences and the things that we — we saw happening to our families.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">QUESTION:  Do you feel that you have a greater emotional understanding of what it’s about? </span><span class="sentence" id="737">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  I don’t know, but — I don’t know if we have or not, but I th-— we f - we — we certainly have a lot of feelings about the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Initially, when we were f — the volunteer program had the — had the volunteers spend time in the exhibition, in the permanent exhibition. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And that was part of your daily tour, you would spend your time on — on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And we began to complain about that because we — it was emotionally too draining to see that exhibit all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="741">QUESTION:  We, you mean, we —
ANSWER:  The volunteers —
QUESTION:  — the volunteer survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">ANSWER:  — and the — yes — no, all the volunteers —
QUESTION:  All the volunteers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="743">ANSWER:  — began to feel that and we, maybe we felt it even more, because of our experience, bu-but all of them began to feel that that was just too much pressure and it was emotionally too upsetting to be in the exhibit that frequently, and for such long periods of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">As I put it, going through the <span class="DLF">exhibit</span> , after awhile the pictures that you saw, the images you saw began to be almost like — like family, they were — they became so familiar, 1t was almost like looking into a family album, and it was just emotionally too wrenching to s — to do that all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Now, once in awhile we do go through the <span class="DLF">exhibit</span> again, and we saw — us-usually when we do, we find November 18, 1997 we see something we didn’t see before. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">But we can’t handle it on a da— ona weekly basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="747">QUESTION:  You say we go through —
ANSWER:  Jill and I.
QUESTION:  You and Jill go through it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">QUESTION:  And — and —
ANSWER:  Oh, some of the other volunteers also do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">QUESTION:  And you do that just on your own initiative —
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">QUESTION:  — to kind of refresh the experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">ANSWER:  Yes sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Or sometimes we have friends who come in, and we’ll go with them, and sometimes we’ll accompany them through the exhibit. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">But on-only infrequently will we go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">But we do want to go through periodically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="756">QUESTION:  And could you say something about the direct experience that you have with the visitors, what that feels like for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">ANSWER:  Well, of course, in most cases it’s — th — it’s — it’s not ver — you do — you don’t have too much reaction, but it c — but periodically you find that there are people who really have some kind of em-emotional experience they want to convey to November 18, 1997 someone, and they — they do that, and they come up and they speak to the volunteers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">QUESTION:  This is an emotional experience that they have in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> —
ANSWER:  In the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="759">QUESTION:  — after —
ANSWER:  Afterwards, they come and — and — and they want to speak to somebody about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I guess they just feel they have to get it off their che — out — off their chest, or they want to pass it along to someone in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , that — that — this experience that they’ve had. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Just a few months ago I had a very interesting experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">A woman came in who spoke — didn’t speak too much English, she was German, a German teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And so she had come up to one of the other volunteers who knew that I spoke German, so she brought this woman over. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">So we spoke, and she said she was a teacher and she was here on some conference and she wanted to see the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And afterwards, she came up to me and she s — was very emotional about what she had seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And she said now, she said, I’m really happy that I’ve seen this, because now no one in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> can tell me that they didn’t know what was going on during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">She said, and I have to pass this along to my grandchildren and my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">She said, I want them to know, make sure that they know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">So occasionally you get those kind of reactions. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Or people who are just November 18, 1997 very emotional about what they’ve seen for some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Either just because the whole exhibit is that way, or they’ve had some experience in their lives that attaches them to the Holocaust in some way. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Some family member, or they themselves; we frequently get other survivors who come in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and come up to us and tell us a little bit about what they felt when they went through the exhibit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="773">QUESTION:  So how has that affected your life the other six days of the week? </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Does that make your experiences more intense, or —
ANSWER:  I think we feel an attachment now to — to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and to the — and to — to the people who come, because it seems to be an experience that’s — that’s important to them in many cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And we’re very kin — we’re particularly also very interested in seeing all these children that come in, these children’s groups, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Now, some of them, of course, probably don’t get much reaction. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">You know how children are sometimes, it’s just another thing on their list. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">But many of them seem to be very interested and do get something positive out of that experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And that’s always something very worthwhile, when you see that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="780">QUESTION:  So when you leave at the end of your duty every Thursday afternoon, how are you usually feeling?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="781">ANSWER:  Very tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Not only fi — not — not so much physically all the time, but emotionally sometimes draining. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">But — but we’re — we’re — but I feel good about it, November 18, 1997 and Jill does too, although she decided to stop the visitors’ service work for a couple of reasons; one, it was getting to be physically to — diff — hard on her. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">She felt that it was too tiring, and she wanted to try something else for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Not that she was unhappy doing it, it was almost physical, more than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">You know — even though, you know, a lot of people say well, you’re always doing the same thing, and there’s no — but it isn’t always the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">It isn’t always the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="788">QUESTION:  So when people come up and want to talk to someone and you’re it, that —
ANSWER:  Yeah, it’s very satisfying. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Or you can answer questions for people. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Lot of people come who have no experience or understanding of what happened in the Holocaust and after they’ve seen it, or even be — sometimes before they see it, they have questions, and they want to ask someone, or — or they want to tell you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And if you can help them deal with that, or answer their questions, that’s very satisfying, cause that <span class="NPIP">place</span> 1s a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where people should learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="792">QUESTION:  Is there any more you want to say about that experience before we move on to a new subject?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="793">ANSWER:  Oh, I think that about covers it. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">I think that’s the — the satisfaction we get out of it is — is — 1s — 1s dual. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">One 1s satisfying to us because of what we’re doing, and it’s November 18, 1997 also satisfying because we feel that that’s something we’ve done for the people that were lost in the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="796">QUESTION:  Have you made trips back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="797">ANSWER:  Well, we made trips to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And of course, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad Vashem</span> and that — lo-long before we had a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Now that’s a very different kind of institution. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">We found that to be emotionally very difficult to handle, Yad Vashem, as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">But I f—I find that I n — in a way I find the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> here easier to handle than I did <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad Vashem</span> for some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">I’m not sure what it was, but — or maybe it was just because the time has passed and I’ve just adjusted better to handling my emotions in relation to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="803">QUESTION:  Oh, this was the first <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> you had [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Yes, yes, and that was many years — the first time we went was many — that was many years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">And — and on our other trips to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> we never — we never went back to the — to the — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad Vashem</span> , because we found it emotionally so upsetting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="805">QUESTION:  Do you think if it had not been so upsetting, you might have considered going?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="806">ANSWER:  Maybe, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="808">QUESTION:  How was it for you otherwise, visiting <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="809">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  Oh, well we — we liked visiting 1s — we went several times with the — when the children were young and we’ve gone since. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And of course my ve — my cousin is there, my — my mother’s nephew. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And we’re close to — because — in a way, because we — we have so little family. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">He also has very little family. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">All those cousins that we would have had, and other family members are all gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And that’s kind of a tie that we have with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="815">QUESTION:  So that’s a very important part of —
ANSWER:  Yes, it 1s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="816">QUESTION:  — going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> —
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="817">QUESTION:  — to see him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="818">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Although, as I said to you before, we visited him si — he’s with the foreign service, the — the Israeli foreign service, so we’ve seen him in Europe several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And he’s been in je — both times he’s been stationed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because he speaks German so well. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And of course for him it’s a different experience, as — well, you know, to be there as a — as a — and in that capacity —
QUESTION:  What was it like for you to visit <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="822">ANSWER:  Well, the first time we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was in 1983. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Was the first time we, either one of us, had been back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And we didn’t know what our reaction November 18, 1997 would be when we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And we both — we went to both where Jill had come from, and also to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilendorf</span> where my mother’s family had come from. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And it was a little difficult to handle, but — but Jill wanted to go back as — and I wanted to go back, just to see where our — where we’d come from and where our parents and family had been, and what that was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And Jill had a lot of memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Jill — Jill has a— many more memories, in a way, from her childhood than I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And of course she had heard a lot from her parents and grandparents and aunts and uncles about life in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , so she wanted to see where they had lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And I went with my cousin then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilendorf</span> , and — and also Jill went along. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And we went to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , on our own, the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where my — where his father and my mother had grown up, where they — and where later my mother had lived, and my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And when we got to the — it was a very interesting experience, we got to the <span class="DLF">door</span> , we knocked and we introduced ourselves and told them who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And the woman who answered the <span class="DLF">door</span> as — was the — was the wife of the man who now was running that <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And her father-in-law was still alive, and he had been the apprentice to my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And when we came in she gave us — it was almost as if she was running a tape, she almost had to get it off her chest as — this whole story that she remembered of my grandfather.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="836">QUESTION:  Had you heard the story before? </span><span class="sentence" id="837">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  No, we hadn’t heard that story before, and it was — that was a very emotionally lil — emotional experience because this was such a sad story and — and Jill and I and my cousin, after we left we sort of said, you know and — although we understood wha — but why couldn’t, you know, someone like that have perhaps taken him and hidden him? </span><span class="sentence" id="838">But you know, of course, that was very dangerous to do, and — and of course they had no obligation to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">It was good enough of them, I guess, that they helped him with food, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">But — but for us it was so terribly sad to hear that. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">First, you know, from someone who had seen him, and — and so we went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">We were rather depressed when we left that — at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Although the people were very nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And we had no — we really didn’t have any bad feelings about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And my parents —
QUESTION:  But you did have the feelings of why couldn’t someone —
ANSWER:  Yes —
QUESTION:  — have hidden him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="846">ANSWER:  — that’s right, exactly, we sort of had those feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Because my mother, my — had always spoken well of those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">I mean, you know, she had had very positive feelings toward them. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And — sort of the people that she knew in her childhood, and of course thought of — all of them obviously weren’t Nazis, necessarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">So we f— we — you know, we didn’t have any bad feelings about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">But November 18, 1997 that was a terrible feeling to go away, and having heard that story from someone who had actually experienced it, and knowing what fate had befallen my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">Then we went back again, this time in 1997 at the invitation of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And they had arranged — they had a pr — they have a pr — they have the prog — a program to bring back sa — people who has — had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> and had been forced to flee, because of the Nazis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="854">QUESTION:  Jews and were there others?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="855">ANSWER:  No, were Jew — no, Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I don’t think there was anyone who wasn’t Jewish that had been brought back. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And since they had missed us on the first program that they had — they had a large group about three, four years earlier, this was a very — ina way it was very good that maybe they’d missed us because now there were only two of us there, and so it was a very personalized kind of thing, very personal. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And they had arranged for us to meet this group. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I call them the — call them the historical society, but their actual name would — closer is the Heimatverein, which sort of a — a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> — a hometown club. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">But basically they’re a historical society, that’s what they’re interested in, they’re interested in the history of — of this part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilendorf</span> , that they — their family — where they live, and where their families have lived for generations as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And when we came they wanted us to — to meet with them, and to tell us what they knew about the Jews that had lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilendorf</span> , and November 18, 1997 also to see what — what our experiences had been after we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">So they — so we not only got the usual tours, but we actually met with people, including my former ne — nanny, and some other people who had lived there for — during the time when my parents were still there, although most of the people were much too young to have been anything but children, or even some of them were, of course, obviously not even born til after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">But they were very interested in what had happened to these — their former — the former residents, the Jewish residents of this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilendorf</span> , which was now incorporated into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> , cause the — so they had done all this genealogical research on my mother’s family. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And one other interesting aspect, by the way of that, I just mention in passing; my mother had always said that she was related to Annie Frank’s family, and we never quite knew how. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">So we had mentioned this to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And the facts — my mother told the story that when Annie Frank’s grandmother, maternal grandmother and — I’m sorry, yes — of — paternal grandmother, was very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">She was one of the people [indecipherable] sort of a distant member of the family, that came when — during her illness, and she spent some time with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">But we never quite knew what the relationship was, so we mentioned it to them and subsequently they deg — dug into the genealogy and they found out what the connection was, that Annie Frank and I had the same great- great-grandparents on her father’s side, which was, you know, her mother’s — well, November 18, 1997 her mother’s side. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">I’m sorry, not her father’s side, her mother’s side. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">So we had the same great-great-grandparents, that’s where the relationship came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Which was very interesting to hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And my mother always said that I had played with her and her sister at some time, but I don’t have any memories of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="873">QUESTION:  What was it like seeing your nanny again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="874">ANSWER:  That was a very — first of all, it was a big surprise, because I didn’t even know she was still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">Of course I — I didn’t know at that time what her age was, because, you know, when you’re six years old everybody — I thought she was much older than she obviously was. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">But it was — it — it was a sort of bittersweet thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Obviously, it was wonderful seeing her again, and hearing her stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">On the other hand, some of the things sh-she told us, were very unhappy things, about, you know, what my — what had began — sort of experiences my parents had [phone ringing] after the Nazis came in and — and the time we were leaving, and what she knew about the family, what had happened to my cousins and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">So that was an unhappy part, but on the other hand, we were very happy to hear from someone who had known the family and had remembered — of course, we also went to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> where my great-great grandparents, great grandparents, my grandmother all are buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And my — and my mother’s twin sister, who died of a — of the influenza epidemics after the first World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">All these people are buried there, at November 18, 1997 this little <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilendorf</span> , and it’s still there, those stones are still standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">So that was a bit of a — a — that sort of gives you an — at a time now, you know, you ve heard these stories, but to actually see it, actually see where these people are buried, and to see that, give you a sort of a more immediate — more immediacy to — to all the things that you heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">It gives it a mo — a newer reality, so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">It was interesting, we also — we also spoke there to one of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> groups there, they had asked us to do — whether we would do that, speak to a group of children. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">That occurred both in the — in the — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> when my wife went back there last year, and this year when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Both times the — the people there asked us to speak to some <span class="BUILDING">school</span> groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">So we did, we spoke to a group in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> called the <span class="BUILDING">Pius gymnasium</span> , named after Pope pa — one of the popes, Pope Pius, one of the Pius’s, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And —
QUESTION:  So this was a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="889">ANSWER:  It — yes, but it’s a public school in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">QUESTION:  What does that mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="891">ANSWER:  Well, it means that it is — in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> they — these <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> are also supported by the state. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">In other words, they’re not <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span> in the sense that we have here. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And —
QUESTION:  So it’s supported financially by the state — November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  Partly, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="894">QUESTION:  — but the Catholic —
ANSWER:  Yes, but it’s a—
QUESTION:  — <span class="BUILDING">church</span> runs the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="895">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, it’s a Catholic — well, yes, the people there are — they — they te — yes, they — they have religious classes as well, as well as the usual <span class="BUILDING">school</span> classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">So it’s — but we spoke to a group of children, two classes wa — and — the ages of 12 to 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And they had done a project on Jewish life in that <span class="REGION">area</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">So they were somewhat familiar about the history of the Jews in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , and they had studied about the — they had sort of a course on comparative religion, so they’d study something about the Jewish religion as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">So they were interested to hear from us about our experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And we did it on a sort of a question and answer basis, rather than just sort of lecture to the students. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">We s — we did it on the basis of answering their questions, which wy — th-the — the children got very much involved, we were really surprised at how involved the children got in this question and answer period. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">They really seemed to show considerable interest in what happened, and — but wa — what it meant to be Jewish and what — a little bit about the Jewish religion, and what had happened to the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> during the period of — of the Nazi regime.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">QUESTION:  So they were interested and curious. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Did you notice any reactions to all this? </span><span class="sentence" id="905">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  Yeah, there was one reaction from the second class. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">They got very much involved in — particularly the — well — well — well, the girls particularly, for some reason, I think they’re more outgoing and are willing to — at that age I think they are a little more mature than the boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And after the class was over, they stayed, and they wanted to know about, you know, where we lived and — and what it was like to be Jewish in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and th — so they — I mean, they carried on even after — after the period was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">So they were — they — they had — they showed quite a bit of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="909">QUESTION:  So they showed interest, did they express any feelings or reactions to the information they were getting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="910">ANSWER:  Not directly. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">I mean, they didn’t evaluate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">It’s just that their response was so positive, that we really felt very good about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">QUESTION:  Positive as far as strong interest?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">ANSWER:  Yeah, strong interest, and the kind of reaction they had, and what they said. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And we promised to send them — the teacher asked us 1n — also to send us — her some information, books and so forth, about the Holocaust, since we were working at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And we said we would, and we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="917">QUESTION:  In English? </span><span class="sentence" id="918">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  In — well, unfortunately they’re all in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And we sent them, and we just got back — course, that t-took us a little bit of time after we got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to get it all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And then when you send a package like that, it takes awhile to get over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And we just got this weekend, we just got a letter from a man who was the head of this Heimatverein, this organization, that we’ve gotten somewhat close with him, he’s a younger man. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">He’s an engineer, he speaks English very well, comes to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> frequently on business. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">And we’ve been running this through him. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">In fact, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that we went to was the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> his children go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">So we sent the books to him to pass along to the teacher, and he just — they just got that the other week, and he sent us back a long letter saying how much they appreciated it, and that the teacher was beginning to get into these books, but could we send them something in German, because they found it more difficult to handle it in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Now the children have — do study English, and these children had one year of English already when we spoke to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">But obviously that — they — it’s easier for them to handle the German. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">But I don’t know whether we can get some of these things in German, or — but they — they were very appreciative of getting this information.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="929">QUESTION:  And so what was that like for you to speak to the children and to get involved with the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="930">November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  Well, we were very happy to pass along to them some firsthand experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">In other words, we were — as they say, and there’s a German phrase for it, which really says you’re a witness of the event. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">We were witnesses of the events that occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I mean, they’re young children, to them this history is almost like reading history about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ancient Rome</span> in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">But — but here were people who actually had the exp — lived in that time f— period, and had experienced some of these things, and they found it very interesting, and they seemed to take to it very readily, and they were very interested in our experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">They wanted to hear what had hap — what we had — you know, what had happened to us, and why it happened to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">Of course, we couldn’t really tell them why in — in one sense, but on the other hand, it made what they had learned in class that much more immediate and real for them, as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And we felt very good about being able to pass this along to this chi — generation, because those are the people we have to — hope to — to get to understand what occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="938">QUESTION:  We have to turn the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Kurt Pauly, tape number two, side B. November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  Yes, you were asking about our — what our feelings were about going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they are very much a mixed — a mixed emotional bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">On one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , of course, it’s very sad and not happy to go to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where those thing that we know happened, and some of them which we experienced ourselves happened, that — so that’s the sad side of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">On the other hand, it was good to see where our families lived, and also to meet people who showed some sincere interest and understanding of what occurred, and really wanted to know what happened, and what our feelings were. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">Now obviously the people we met in these circumstances, are people who have — well we — shall we say a positive attitude toward what occurred in the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">I mean — so in the — in the sense that they know what happened, and feel that they want to try to make good in some sense, to the limited extent that they can, the terrible — make goods — you know, the — it’s — from the terrible things that occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">So it’s very good to meet those kind of people now. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Obviously we know that there’s still anti-Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and that there are still people running around in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who were perhaps directly involved in some of the atrocities that occurred in the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">So, you know, and so that gives you kind of a terrible feeling when you’re just walking down the <span class="DLF">street</span> and you see someone of an age that you know went through the period as an adult; period of the Holocaust, period from ’33 through °45; and you wonder, you know, November 18, 1997 you have this — this — this nagging feeling about, you know, who are these people? </span><span class="sentence" id="947">You know, were they perpetrator, were they di — were they directly involved? </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And that’s a very, very difficult emotion to deal with. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">But on the other hand, I guess it’s — ina way it’s a good thing to face up to that, and to know that both of these sides of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> still exist, and the hope we have 1s for this younger gener — these younger generation to really understand and that — what happened, and therefor try to make sure it doesn’t happen again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="950">QUESTION:  How do you think your experience has affected your current or past political views, or your opinions about national and international issues?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="951">ANSWER:  Well, I think it pr — the fact that it happened, and happened to our families, happened to us, that pe — you know, that here are people who have lived in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> for hundreds of years, as my family and Jill’s family had done, and really felt German, no question about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">I mean, my father was a soldier in the first World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">And the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were as patriotic Germans as the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> are patriotic Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">I mean, they felt German. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And to think that what happened could happen, and did happen, is in a way very disturbing to us individually, because [phone ringing] somehow you have that nagging feeling that maybe it could happen again, and maybe even could happen here. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">I mean, I think survivors had more of that feeling than people who did not go through that. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">November 18, 1997
QUESTION:  And you had that feeling more than people who did not —
ANSWER:  I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">I think, based on my — our experiences with people who were not survivors of the Holocaust, who were not in Europe, who were Americans, and have lived here, didn’t have that experience directly, I think we feel differently than they do. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And I get th — I get the same reaction from other friends of ours who are also survivors, that they have those feelings and those emotions. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">I just — you ju — they — I mean, I guess you can never quite feel as certain about what’s going to happen, and that it’ll be that — or that something like that occurred in the Holocaust can’t happen again, or can’t happen to Jews again, or can’t happen in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> again, as people who didn’t have that experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">I think that also makes the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for us, much more important in that sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">That that is something that was not there when the Holocaust occurred, and had it been there, probably things would have been somewhat different, because at least Jews would have had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="963">QUESTION:  How does this feeling affect your politics or your participation in the community?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="964">ANSWER:  Oh, I think — I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">But I thi — I don’t know whether it has some of that direct effect — maybe I’m — I’m [indecipherable] our politics might be otherwise, but it definitely, I think, has an effect on how we interpret the events, and what November 18, 1997 people say and do. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">And when something occurs, maybe we feel — you know, if we see something — maybe we are more apt to interpret something as being anti-Jewish or anti-Semitic than others, because we said, hey, wait a minute, 1s that really — you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And it may not be, but I think you have that reaction more quickly than people who have not gone through something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="968">QUESTION:  Does an example come to mind?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="969">ANSWER:  Well, let me try to think. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">All right, when we had this — oh, what was this fellow down in <span class="REGION">Louisiana</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="971">Can’t think. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">He ran for the U.S. Senate from <span class="REGION">Louisiana</span> —
QUESTION:  Huey Long”
ANSWER:  No, no, no, no, no, much later, recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">A few years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">No, not Huey Long, much earlier — much later than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I can’t think of his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">He was a really —I mean, he really was someone who not so much — not necessarily anti-Semitic direct, but he was just sort of anti a lot of things, and he had — obviously was a person with a great deal of — of — of prejudices, in terms of minorities and other people who were not, you know, quite Anglo-Saxon Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And when you — you know, so I think our reaction to that was much more fearful in a way, than other Americans who said, oh well, you know, he’s out on a far limb, he’s far — you know, he’s way out of the political s — on the side of some extreme side of the political spectrum, because we said, well, people like that who were on the far side of the political November 18, 1997 spectrum in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , finally got into power, and we said, you know — so we’re much more — I think perhaps we’re much more concerned about those things than people who don’t have those experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And when we see it in other parts of the world also, we’re — we S — we — we perhaps in si — always more fearful that people who have such negative views, in terms of other minority groups, whether it’s here or in Europe, or in Asia, can get into a position where they can create the kind of regime that did the sort of thing that happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="979">I do think that that’s something that impacts survivors more than others.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="980">QUESTION:  And it impacts you more than others.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="981">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes, as — me as well, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">But overall, I think we’re, you know, basically, because of our age when we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I think we’re prow — we are, on the other hand, not as much affected as people who even went — or, you know, who — who went through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> who went through the actual events of the — that occurred in Europe in the Holocaust, I don’t think we are — we don’t — I don’t think we have quite their emotions, cause they must have a whole other set of emotions, and concerns and reactions. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">But I do think we are also — but we — I think we’re somehow different emotionally than people who haven’t had any — the experience even we’ve had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="984">QUESTION:  So it’s had a major, lasting impact on — November 18, 1997
ANSWER:  Yes, and I think it had it — and the other thing 1s, I think it had a — a terrible impact on our families, our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">I th — don’t kn — you know, there’ve been — there’s been a lot written about people who were in Europe and — and survived the Holocaust in Europe, or — and what happened to them, people who were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> or hidden, or so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">I don’t think there’s been much written about people who got out of Europe, but had the experiences that our parents had, and what — what that meant for them, because here were people who were just, you know, ripped out of their environment, and ripped out of everything that they were used to, and were thrown into another world, other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , and had to adjust, you know, to — try to establish a whole new life for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">Now, obviously their experiences were not as horrible as the people who were involved in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , but they certainly, I know, are — both of our families suffered a great deal as a result of that as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">It’s a different kind of suffering and it’s a different kind of experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="989">QUESTION:  But it’s suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="990">ANSWER:  But it’s there, nevertheless, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">So, I— I know our children and our nieces and nephews and all the people of the next generation, they have again different experience and different feeling because they’re again another step removed from the events in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">But I think even those people are somewhat impacted by our experiences, because they’ve heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">November 18, 1997
QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">So it’s a part of their world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="995">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">Now, their children, again, now they’re gonna be another — further removed from it, and now it really becomes ancient history, in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">And that’s why I think the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> is very important, because it brings that history to these people, to these young people, and to the people who had no experience with the Holocaust, and says oh hey, wait a minute, here it is, and it’s — it’s more immediate than just reading about it, or hearing about it, sort of on the background noise, and hopefully it brings it up as a more — as a — as a more real experience, that it really did happen, and it happened fairly recently, and it happened to people that are still alive today. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">That was an interesting experience once I had in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> when I was at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevators</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="999">A young group came — some young people came through, oh, young teenagers, maybe again, 12, 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">And one of the boys came up to me while we were waiting — while they were waiting for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> , and he says, is th — is there anybody still alive who — who experienced this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">So to him this was already, you know, really, you know, ancient history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">So what I told him I had — had an exper — you know, that I had lived through that, I guess it was sort of like, you know, meeting Julius Caesar or something, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">But — so that — our whole experience wa — you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Now, we don’t want to make the Holocaust, you know, sort of a religion of life now because I think that’s a ne — that’s very negative. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">But I November 18, 1997 think we have to remember what happened, and — and live our life knowing those events occurred, and what those mean.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1006">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you can think to say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1007">ANSWER:  No, I think that’s — I think that’s about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1008">QUESTION:  Well —
