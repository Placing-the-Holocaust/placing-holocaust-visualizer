<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Can you tell us a little bit about your early life, pre-Nazi takeover? </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Life in the 20s, both your father’s profession, family’s religious affiliation, Jewish communo(ph) affiliation, schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">May 27, 2010
ANSWER:  My parents always had to rent a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">They did not own an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and they always looked for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to rent near a <span class="DLF">park</span> , so that it would be easy for the children to go there and play. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">They were sufficiently well off for my mother to have one or two household helps, because in those days you didn’t have dishwashers, and you couldn’t go to the gr-grocery store and get prepared food, so it was a lot more work to feed four children and a husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">My father was the first in his family to break away from the pattern of being a petty merchant selling a — running a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> to provide clothing and dry goods. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">He was able to purchase a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , manufacturing shaving brushes, something we don’t use any more today. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And he was married in 1912, shortly after the sinking of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Titanic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And so I still remember in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , there was a memento to the pi — Titanic, because that was an event that apparently affected a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And shortly after he purchased the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , World War II — World War I broke out, and he and his brothers — he had four brothers — three brothers — were drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And my father served in the German army for four years, and was very upset and resentful over the amount of anti-Semitism he experienced.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  Can you describe what sort of anti-Semitism he noticed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Well — well, what I do remember, his telling me about the complaint that too many Jews were trying to get out of serving in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">So, the German government decided to have a census of how many Jews were serving in the May 27, 2010 German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">When the findings were that the Jews were overrepresented 1n the army, the results were not published, not until the late 20s. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">But — so he was drafted as a private and ended his service as a private, as did most Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I mean, if you were a physician or a dentist, you might become an officer, but by and large Jews were not considered qualified to be in combat, and so he spent his period of time in the transportation system, which meant looking after horses, because that was the main vehicle transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So, I remember these things, I’m sure, not when I was — before going to <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">But I had always someone, a — a caretaker, looking after the smaller children, or taking us to an aunt and uncle’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , who had a child my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So this is how I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , but I do not recall having any non- Jewish German friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  What sort of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did you attend?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  What?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  What sort of <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> did you attend?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Well, I went to a <span class="BUILDING">parochial school</span> , of which — of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">We lived there, nearby, walking distance, and I do remember being attacked sometimes by other kids, ger — who didn’t like Jewish kids, and you had to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And so I went to this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which was not a very good <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ; we had, I would say, very poor teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And I was kind of a rebellious, problematic child. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I would talk back to the May 27, 2010 teachers sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And at one point, a teacher called me a donkey. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And so I said, well if I am a donkey, you are a monkey. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And the teacher was so upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And finally my parents bribed me to apologize, even though I — they agreed I — it was justified for me to talk back. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">But as soon as — after four years, I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> as in — they call it in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And in the middle of that year, that was in 1933, the government decided that no Jewish child should be allowed to go to a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , and so I was notified that I could not continue, in 1934.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  Let me step back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Before ’33, how aware of you what — were you of the political unrest that was going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Did you witness any political rallies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Well, strange is, I do remember being very interested in what was going on, and reading the newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Now, of course, I had two older brothers, who were educationally very active, so I would say at age eight and nine, I was very much aware of elections, and the propaganda in elections and the Nazi party, and the Nationalists, who were close to the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So certainly I have very vivid memories of 1932 and 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">But I do not recall ever feeling frightened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  When the results of the plebiscite were announced in °32, and they announced that Hitler had won, what was the immediate reaction in your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Did people take it seriously? </span><span class="sentence" id="43">May 27, 2010
ANSWER:  Well, my father at that point lost his job, because the company for which he w — he had to give up his business because of the depression. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">It was based in — a lot on export of shaving brushes to other <span class="REGION">European countries</span> , and he had traveled a great deal to different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , and as a result I became a stamp collector. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">But he lost his business because in the depression there just wasn’t enough, so he worked for a company selling their c — shaving brushes. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And he lost the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And I remember in 19 — you know, in January and February 1933, when Hitler came into power, that this was pretty bad, but we didn’t think it was a catastrophe. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">It wouldn’t last, after all, the Nazi party was not a majority, but close to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And I remember my father, for example, printing advertisements to announce that he was making men’s suits to — for measure. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">He hired tailors to do the work, and he would find customers and take their measurements and sell tailor made clothing, which in those days was a very common thing, I mean, you didn’t have the mass production. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And so he had advertisements printed, and when I was out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or had a day off, I would take these ads and put them into <span class="DLF">mailboxes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">My first job. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So he, even though there was a Nazi boycott, he continued to try and sell, although gradually the business stopped, because it was dangerous and counterproductive for Germans to do business with any Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So, in 1934 -’35, he effectively ceased having an income.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Now, did you witness any of the Nuremberg rallies in the first year? </span><span class="sentence" id="56">May 27, 2010
ANSWER:  No, no I— I was aware of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I was aware of the Stiirmer newspaper, that came out every week, but the Jewish youth groups to which I belonged, a religious Zionist group called Esba(ph) continued to function. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">We went on hiking trips and — and at that time, while I do remember the boycott of Jewish businesses on April 1“, 1933, being surprised how many businesses were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So this — a friend walking around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , I said, good God, these are Jew — all Jewish, because they were being boycotted, but I wasn’t have a — didn’t have a sense of fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And once on a hike, a group of Nazi SS troops told us we had to break up camp and go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">But again, no sense of fear that anything would happen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So, I was spared the frightening experiences of Jews after 1937 - ’38, when there was a great deal of physical abuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">There were some Jews arrested in ’33, and a few were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , but I didn’t — my family didn’t know any of them, so that I would say — when I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> I never had experienced the sense of physical fear, because that came later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  Let me go back, when you mentioned that you were expelled from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , can you sort of describe that day, how you found out that you were no longer allowed to attend the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , how you filled up your days afterwards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Well, that is interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">In <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , there was a complete shift, because since I —I was a fairly good student, very good student in fact, but had very bad May 27, 2010 relationships with the teachers, who found that I asked too many questions and you know, there were all kinds of religious instruction and I wasn’t quite sure, and asked questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So, we had problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So when I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , everything changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I was a good student, the student — the teachers liked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">When the teachers ran out of booklets for examinations, he would send me to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> nearby to pick them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And I remember one time he says, oh you can’t go to this <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , because it’s owned by a Jew, you have to go to that <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I didn’t like that, but — I was well regarded in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and one day found out that — that all — not only I, but other Jewish children had to leave, and — well, that’s politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> — by that time I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , my family had moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and there they had a very good <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , whose teachers, many of them were college professors who had lost their jobs, who later on sometimes became quite famous individually, as scholars in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So, I went for one year to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Griinewald</span> , from which, by the way, the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> were deported from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And so I would say I did not, as I said, I — I knew what was going on, because I listened to the news, and read the newspapers and talked to friends about what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Q2: Can I just interject a question? </span><span class="sentence" id="77"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> had the odious distinction of having Julius Streicher as the gauleiter, the Nazi leader of — of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Franconia</span> , and also the May 27, 2010 publisher of “Der Stiirmer,” and I was just wondering, you know, about how visible was “Der Stirmer” —
ANSWER:  Very visible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  — and — and what kind of response did it generate among —
ANSWER:  I mean, since I didn’t have any German friends — I mean, we had a German maid, two German maids, we never talked about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I didn’t talk to German — non- Jewish German kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">You read the fr — crazy, outrageous stories every week. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I mean, I didn’t buy the paper, but I looked at the <span class="BUILDING">newsstand</span> , at the front page. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And well, this is Nazi, this is — you s — you s — you grew up, you lived with this as part of the realities of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Later on when I studied the history of my family, prior ge — generations also had to sort of take the fact that there was anti-Semitism for granted, the way minorities today live in so many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> where there is governmentally supported discrimination. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">But, we talked about it at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I think my parents decided, because of the history of all this, that there was no future for us in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , as early as 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Whereas so many German Jews thought this would pass the way it had always passed, and they delayed making a decision to leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  Okay, let’s talk about the decision to emigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Now, who is the first members of your family to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and what prompted them to go where they did, and May 27, 2010
ANSWER:  Well, since my father had to go — went backrumpt — bankrupt when the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> could no longer sell enough, we didn’t have the financial means to get an immigration visa from [indecipherable] <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , because in the early 30s there was a depression all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Nobody wanted immigrants. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">It was very difficult to get visas, so 1t became clear that 1t would be very unlikely to be able to emigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">We actually had distant relatives in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> who emigrated in the 19" century, but my father didn’t know about them, because they were, you know, three or four generations back. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So my two older brothers decided not to have an academic career, but to become Halutzim or physical laborers and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And they succeeded.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  And what year was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  °35 and ’36. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And there was an opportunity for children to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> under a special program to finish <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and then return <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , hopefully. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And my parent decided, with much discussion in — within the larger family, to send my younger brother, who was 12, and me, who was 14 to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> under this program where, in <span class="BUILDING">foster homes</span> , we would finish our education. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And they were able to emigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  Let’s talk a little bit about this program. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Can you — a-actually want to go in two different directions, cause I want to talk about your parents’ emigration to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">May 27, 2010 But first, can you describe the program that you were under; who subsidized it, was this through the Jewish community, was it general, what political ramifications were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Well, we all know historically that President Roosevelt took very little action to help the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">He had a congress that was not willing to change immigration laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And within the Department of State, and in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> as well, the bureaucracy felt, whatever immigrants we get, we don’t need Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And so they made it especially difficult for Jews to get papers, unless they had very good connections in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But, under pressure, Roosevelt agreed to commit, I don’t know how many, whether it was 2,000 or 20,000 children from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> under a guarantee of the Jewish community that they would not become a burden to the welfare system. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">It was called the German Jewish Children’s Aid Society. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And I think my younger brother was on the first group, and I came a week later on the second group —
QUESTION:  What year and month was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  — traveling on the S.S. Harding. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And while it was upsetting, I — I felt, and my parents reinforced this, this was a temporary thing, and that we would be reunited after they got out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And so I landed the day before Thanksgiving of 1934, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and was temporarily picked up to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of one of the May 27, 2010 officers of the German Jewish Children’s Society, a attorney, John L. Bernstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And then later on to — went to another <span class="BUILDING">foster home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  I want to come back later and ask you about what it was like living in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> without parents, but why don’t we jump over to your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">After you and your siblings all left, where did they go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Well, actually, my parents’ marriage was — did not come — it sort of deteriorated as he lost his business. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">My mother was an intellectual. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">He was interested in things, but really did not share her intellectual interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And so the marriage was not a good marriage, but I didn’t know about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">My older brothers did, and they did divorce and emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> separately. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And my father found another girlfriend and they emigrated together, also to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So it was a congenial divorce. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">There wasn’t much to argue about in 1936, although emotionally this was a very difficult thing for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But she got a good deal of support from her family and her sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So — however, there was a tremendous amount of correspondence between members of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I have letters, about this many, with my parents, my mother, my father, my brothers and we kept the letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So, over the years, my brothers gave me the letters, because I was the only one in the family who showed interest, and of course, the only one who could read German. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So I have a tremendous collection of letters, and I have to decide what to do with May 27, 2010 them, because I don’t think I have the time right now to go through them. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But they present a great deal of day to day information of how a normal refugee family dealt with the realities of emigration, adjustment, what — interrelationships. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Today this would never happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">People might communicate by email, but in those days, letter writing was the only means of communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And it meant having — spending money on postage, which for my parents was not easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So, most of the letters, th-the — every inch of the paper was filled with words. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">In other words, you didn’t have any margins, to save money.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  What was — how late were you able to keep up the correspondence?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  Til 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Til <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> declared war, since the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> was — we c — So we couldn’t — I have letters from ’40 and ’41 from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And we didn’t have the money to telephone. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I didn’t have the money, and they didn’t have the money, because in those days, to make a long distance call was very expensive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  Let me — oh — Q2: What did your parents do when they got to the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  Well, my mother took care of elderly people who needed some support. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So she was basically a health aide of elderly people, and they were all deported, of course, after the Nazis came, although my mother was able to escape to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and hid there for a while until a local Nazi gave her away, and they arrested her. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So the — May 27, 2010 my father learned dry cleaning, he took a course in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> on how to dry clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And even though they had no permit, no working permit, but to be a household aide, you really didn’t need a permit. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">That’s — it’s the kind of job that nobody wanted, so my mother could work. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And my father was doing busin — I guess, also extra-legally, but the Dutch apparently didn’t enforce the restrictions with such efficiency, and — I mean, they didn’t have any — much money and they may even have gi — been given some support by the Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , but I don’t know those details. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">They didn’t write about it, and I didn’t ask about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  I want to ask you now, what it was like for a young boy, 14 years old I remember, to live with a foster family that he had never met before, and what was your adjustment learning English, learning a new educational system, learning a new family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  Well, I didn’t feel really comfortable in any of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , but felt I had to —I was grateful, and I had to be accommodative. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">The first fast — foster home family were — was a wealthy family living on Central Park West in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> ina big <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">They had three daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And so they felt having a boy in the family would be a good idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">But they were very Orthodox, and I found myself at that time becoming more and more estranged to Orthodoxy, and they noticed that, May 27, 2010 so I was moved to another family, the son of the Rabbi de Sola Pool, the head of Shearith Israel of the <span class="BUILDING">Sephardic synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , who was a sort of son of a famous father who wasn’t doing quite so well, so it was difficult for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">He was a salesperson for different companies, but never quite made it in the corporate world, and they had one son, a little younger than I, and — almost the same age, and that created problems, because he was doing okay in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but I was academically outstanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And so I think that created problems for Richard Mindas(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I didn’t have any problems with him, but we didn’t become close. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And — but I went first to a <span class="BUILDING">New York school</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Jefferson High School</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And there, fortunately, they had a good speech department. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So the speech therapist took an interest in me, and helped me to learn to speak English properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So I got a lot of special instruction, and my capacity to speak English and to spell and so on, developed rather quickly, so that when later on, before I graduated, I actually got better grades in English than most of my fellow students, because I had to learn the language and therefore was more careful with spelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So actually, I graduated from White Plains High School at the age of 16, because I got credit by taking examinations in world history and European history. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I had to learn American history, I had to learn English, but math and geography, I passed the Regents Exams, so that I graduated early and went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> at the age of 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">May 27, 2010
QUESTION:  And who paid for your <span class="BUILDING">college</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Was the German children’s aid still supporting you at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  I first went to a free — to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> ’s high s — City College, because that was free. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">But after one year got a scholarship to go to <span class="BUILDING">Cornell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And I also got a scholarship for maintenance from — through the German Jewish Children’s Aid from someone of the Woberg(ph) family. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Because one of their daughters who was active in the Zionist movement met me and I was so knowledgeable about what was going on in the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> , she decided to get the family to send me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And I also met the president of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hadassah</span> , because her son went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> to which I was invited. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So that I had connections, through my knowledge of what was going on in the Jewish world. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I did a lot of reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I had a nephew by marriage of my father, who was a professor at the <span class="BUILDING">theological seminary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">So I had contacts with the academic world at the age of 15 and 16 and 17 that resulted in my having contacts among the Jewish leadership elite, including Rabbi Pool, whose wife also became president of Hadassah. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And at one point I was invited by Justice Brandeis to meet with him in his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , because he was interested in cooperative farming and kibbutzim. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And by that time I had a job to do research in that <span class="DLF">field</span> .</span></p>

QUESTION:  A veterinarian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  A what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  A veterinarian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  A veterinarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I really had very poor advice, in terms of making choices. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I had no one to talk to. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">But when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> and took a course in animal husbandry, I came to the dec — quickly to the decision that I was not the right person to help cows and horses deliver their offspring. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And also, I took a course in rural sociology. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And there I wrote a term paper on the kibbutz movement, simply from what you read in the newspapers and knew from my brothers in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And the professor liked the paper so much — he happened to be the editor of rural sociology, so it got published. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So at — as a junior at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> , I was a <span class="BUILDING">pub</span> — I had a publication in a — in —1n a well-known journal, and that made a big difference in my subsequent career. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And that’s how Justice Brandeis heard about me and whose interest in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and its economic development was a private, but very great interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And so I think, through Mrs. Epstein, somehow he heard about me and he invited me to come to see him on a Sunday morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  What was your impression of him? </span><span class="sentence" id="190">May 27, 2010
ANSWER:  Well, he obviously knew an awful lot, and I really didn’t have enough of understanding of the significance of being invited by a member of the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> , to fully be amazed at this — you know, this was, for me, a normal thing that happens.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  [indecipherable] I’m trying to do the math. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">You came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> at 14, you graduated at 16, so we’re talking now — it’s about ’39 — ’40?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  That’s right, I gradu — graduated in 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  And I want to ask you, how aware were you of what was going on back in Europe? </span><span class="sentence" id="195">What sort of news were you getting about the start of World War II, how much news was filtering?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  I was very much aware, I mean, reading Eng-English, being able to read in German, my parents wouldn’t — would write once or twice a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I would write back, not often, make copies of my letters, so I — my letter writings not only have their letters, but my responses. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And much of that is also true of my brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So, even correspondence with my grandmother, who remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> because she didn’t think the Nazis would bother an older lady, and so she was not willing to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> when everybody else left. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">She had a nice <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So I was very much aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I would say I was more aware of what was going in Europe May 27, 2010 than most people, and probably as much aware of what was going on as my teachers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  And was there any mobilization on the part of the American Jewish community at this point, in ’39, after the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , for relief efforts, that you saw?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  Well, I was aware of the tremendous sense of frustration of the American Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">But on the other hand, I was aware of the complexities of the leadership. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I mean, like Rabbi Wise, who had good relationship with Roosevelt, and so he had to be very careful in open criticism of the Department of State. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I was aware of the American Jewish committee and their ambivalence about being too supportive of the Zionists, because after all, we Jews are religion rather than a nationality, and I was very much identified with the idea that Jews are both a religion and a nationality. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And so I would say I had a quite advanced knowledge, not only what was going on in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , or in much of the rest of Europe, what was going on in the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">When I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> , there was a pretty active communist youth group, and I was among the Jewish kids who were very much opposed to the Soviet Union, because of — even though they seemed to be wi — quite progressive, they were a dictatorship. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And so I was active in the Hillel Society and that group was very much opposed to the Soviet Union, whereas there May 27, 2010 were a lot of — not a lot, but there was a sufficiently active group of students at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> that felt that the Soviet Union had the solution to mankind’s future.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  What sort of activities was your group, the Zionist group at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hillel</span> doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  Well, first of all, we were very critical of the Soviet Union; of its dictatorship, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> , Stalin. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">We did not think they are progressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">There were lots of arguments. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And so, I had friends among the anti- communists, but you know, I did become a Republican as a result, but I was politically active, and one of my friends was a Iraqi Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">The only Jew ever sent by the Iraqi government, on a scholarship of the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">They every year sent over some students to get an American degree, and Mayer(ph) Sofaya(ph) was the only one who was Jewish who they ever selected. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And so we became very friendly, and through him I learned a lot of what was going through the Arab world, and I did — was invited to his wedding in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> in 1945, and actually went to the wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I didn’t get there on time, but I actually met him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> , in — at the end of 1945, and that another interesting story, how knowing him enabled me to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">QUESTION:  We'll get to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Now, I just want to check, your official status at this point is you're still a German citizen, or were you officially stateless?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  No, I was a German citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">May 27, 2010
QUESTION:  And so how did the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ’ entry into World War II, let’s go to Pearl Harbor, what were the ramifications for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  Well, you have to keep in mind that when I went to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> , I was accepted at the school of social work ka — at <span class="BUILDING">Chicago University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And in the first semester, where I had a job selling clothes in a men’s clothing store, I suddenly was offered a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> to set up a research institute on cooperative farming. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">So I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , and found myself at the age of 21, or — [file break] August 1, 2010
QUESTION:  This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum with Joseph Eaton, conducted by Judith Cohen on August 31% — August first in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> , <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">It’s a continuation of the interview begun at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> in June. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Okay, when we left off with the previous interview, you had finished telling us about your experiences at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> and were just beginning your <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> and about to enter the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">So let’s start with after you left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> and began <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  After I graduated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> , I had been advised by a professor who Leonard Katrow(ph), who was very friendly towards me and invited me to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> many times, he advised me not to go into <span class="BUILDING">academia</span> , because he said Jews didn’t have much of a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And that it would be better off to study the applications of sociology, so I applied to a school of social work at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span> , which at that time was well regarded, and had a sociological orientation, rather than a psychiatric orientation. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And while I was there, I received a phone call from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , from Edward A. Newman, a wealthy Jewish banker, asking me if I were interested in conducting a study of cooperative farming in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , what our experiences were in that <span class="DLF">field</span> , because the — Henry Wallace, either secretary of agriculture or vice-president at — I think he had just stopped being vice-president, Truman had been appointed — was very interested 1n possibly expanding August 1, 2010 cooperative farming in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> as a way of helping landless farm workers to become owners, and they were particularly interested in moshavim, because one of the sons of Henry Wallace had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for a summer, and reported about kibbutzim and moshavim. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">So Edward Newman, who knew Henry Wallace, decided to fund a study. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And the reason he called me 1s a term paper of mine on kibbutzim in the junior year had gotten published in a journal. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And so, I looked like being an expert in an <span class="REGION">area</span> where nobody else was really better informed. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Not that I really was an expert, because I didn’t speak Hebrew and had never lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So I decided to accept the job and after one quarter at the end of December, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to start the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">The study was — had to have a organizational sponsorship, and so we set up the rules [indecipherable] institute, and with the help of Henry Wallace, I was able to recruit a board of directors, who were very, very prominent. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Some of them were suggested by Justice Brandeis, who heard about the study and invited me to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on a Sunday morning to tell him what was happening in the <span class="DLF">cooperative farming field</span> , especially <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">He obviously continued to have a significant influence and interest, and indeed, had been responsible for the book by Walter C. Loudermilk, the commissioner of social si — the commissioner of conservation in the department of agriculture, who had made a study of why 1s it that in the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> , there is such incredible poverty, when at August 1, 2010 one time in their history, it was the most advanced and prosperous area? </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And he went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Morocco</span> , all the way to <span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> and then wrote a book in which he pointed out that the neglect and the poverty was due to the way the social structure was operating under Islam, and the only bright light was the Jewish settlements in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And he praised them and pointed out the modern agricultural methods and thi — the <span class="DLF">green line</span> already existed in 1940 when — in ’41. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And when Henry Wallace got the report, he apparently called Brandeis and told him, you should really look at this. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And Brandeis got someone, a woman, to edit the report, publish it as a book called, “The Land of Promise,” and the book was distributed to every member of Congress. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And so, the fact that I was making the study was obviously of interest to Brandeis. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So suddenly, as a refugee, I felt myself interacting with people in the so — conservation service, the agricultural extension service, and wherever I went to study cooperative farming experiences in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I had superb cooperation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">QUESTION:  In this period, when you met Brandeis, and you’re going around looking at the <span class="DLF">farms</span> , did anybody ever question the fact that you were a refugee, and ask you about —
ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Neither they, or any of the officials, very high officials, I mean, you know, third level subcabinet officers, and the — the U.S. government, under Henry August 1, 2010 Wallace had begun <span class="DLF">cooperative farms</span> by purchasing large <span class="DLF">plantations</span> that were going bankrupt, especially in the south, and then hiring farm managers and recruiting impoverished farm laborers, put them on the <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Each — the <span class="REGION">land</span> was owned cooperatively by the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">They didn’t know much about how to run a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , so they built a large <span class="DLF">farm</span> and equipment for large machinery, and the farm manager began to teach the workers and gradually they took more and more responsibility for running the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And so I s-studied the 27 experimental areas, traveling all over the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  And how long did you stay with this job?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  Well, until I was drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">In the middle of the study, I was drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I had part of a manuscript with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I also visited some of the <span class="DLF">religious collective farms</span> , like the Amish and Amana colonies in <span class="REGION">Iowa</span> , which were communistic [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">But before I finished, I was drafted, but I somehow managed to finish my report and Harper Brothers decided to publish the report as a book, calling it, “Exploring Tomorrow’s Agriculture.” </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So after, when I was in basic training at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dix</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> —
QUESTION:  And what year and month was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">ANSWER:  That was 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I—I went in the army °42, but in basic training. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I think 1t was ’43 the book was published. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And I was a private being trained to be a first aid enlisted August 1, 2010 man to deal with injured people in the <span class="DLF">battlefield</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">When a package arrived, and I immediately knew when it was brought in by the first sergeant that this was not food from some f-friend or relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">But he made me open it up, and it was a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And he looked at this and says, he expected some food and candy that could be distributed — he said, did you write this? </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">He said, well, 1f you can write so well, let’s see how well you are in cleaning pots. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So everybody laughed and for one week I had swep — special duty in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , cleaning these very large pots, some of them so large that you had to go into the pot to clean it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">QUESTION:  Let me ask two questions; one 1s, do you attribute his response just to the fact that he was disappointed that there was no food, or do you think any of this was anti-Semitic, or anti-intellectual?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">ANSWER:  I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I don’t think there was — I experienced no discrimination or reference to my refugee status. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">First of all, I spoke English extremely well. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I did better on many tests, including sharpshooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I was not outstanding, but you know, did adequately. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So the — within the army, I did not experience any anti-foreignism, or anti-Semitism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  And, let me ask a different question. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">What name were you going by at this point, and can you talk about change of name? </span><span class="sentence" id="278">August 1, 2010
ANSWER:  My brothers and I had changed our name in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">After the war had begun, and my brothers, one of them was in the British Army and the other in the Haganah in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and people in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> anyhow wanted — didn’t want German names. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">But one of the special problems we faced is that our parents were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , and if we were taken prisoner, this might — we were worried that this could cause problems for them as parents of traitors, because we were obviously fighting against the <span class="REGION">Fatherland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">So we decided to change our name and adopted a name that was suggested by Rabbi de Sola Pool, and — whom — whom I knew, because his wife was president of Hadassah. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And I was one of the people she became interested in because there weren’t many young Americans who showed much interest and real knowledge about Zionism and <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , which I did because I had been very active in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , even though I was only 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So, he was very helpful, and he ultimately married Helen and me, even though we were not Sephardim. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So, at any rate, this 1s how, professionally, I finished a book which <span class="BUILDING">Columbia University</span> accepted as my dissertation. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Because at <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span> you had to publish your dissertation, and here I had a book published by Harper brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So my dissertation was approved before I had taken more than one course in sociology at <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So when I came back from the army, I had to take all the courses and pass examination about substance, but I didn’t have to write a dissertation. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">August 1, 2010
QUESTION:  Okay, so now let’s go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dix</span> , and you’re working there, training to be someta — medic, and you’re going by the name of Eaton at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And then what happens?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">ANSWER:  Well, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dix</span> , when we finished our basic training, I was a sort of middle range effective first aid man, because not being very tall, I had problems carrying these — the what do you call — you carry human beings on — that are injured on a —

<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  You know, you had to carry the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> and — and on battlefields you had to be — keep your head down and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So you had to carry, you didn’t do it by yourself, two people had to carry a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">But most people preferred others to work with them than me, because I wasn’t as strong as many other soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">So, instead of being sent to a <span class="DLF">field</span> , to a division, I ended up at a <span class="BUILDING">military hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Rucker</span> , <span class="REGION">Alabama</span> , as a clerk. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And it looked like my future would be to be a clerk in a <span class="BUILDING">military hospital</span> , and I was very well regarded, because I was among the relatively few people who could handle medical records, with all their special August 1, 2010 words, and being able to identify diagnoses and to spell them properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So I was — my commanding officer thought very well of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">It might even result in a promotion to private first class, but before that happened, he got a notice from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> that I was being transferred.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">QUESTION:  Let me just interject one question, and then we’ll talk about the transfer. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">What was your official citizenship status at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">ANSWER:  I was an enemy alien, and I was drafted as an enemy alien. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And as an enemy alien, I was obviously under FBI surveillance. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I know this because in 1942 I received a postcard from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , from an aunt, saying that they needed money so that they might be able to get a visa to <span class="COUNTRY">Ecuador</span> for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And they didn’t have money, could I raise 12,000 dollars? </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And within two days or so after I got the postcard, the FBI came to my <span class="DLF">door</span> and asked me if I had sent any money, pointing out to me that this was trading with the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Well, I didn’t have any money, I didn’t know anybody I could get 12,000 dollars from. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">But I know, obviously my mail was being monitored. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And, you know, the — they did say to me, it’s just as well you didn’t send them any money, because this is just a scam, as far as we know. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">But my mail was being censored, without ever being notified.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">QUESTION:  So, now as an enemy alien, you’re in the army —
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">August 1, 2010
QUESTION:  — and —
ANSWER:  So we’re as — but the fact that I was drafted, this didn’t seem to bother anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So it might have meant that I might have been promoted more quickly, that could be a factor, because I was ap — still a private after s-several months in a really important position in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">In other words, I was in charge of the night shift, and when people came in, they depended on me to keep the records straight, and that had been, apparently, a real problem, simply because it wasn’t always easy to get the right people to do the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Well educated people usually were assigned to other jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">QUESTION:  And then why did you leave this job?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">ANSWER:  So, what happened, and I only learned that later, is that when you’re drafted — in World War II, the army had adopted the IBM technology to keep personnel records, so that every soldier, when he was drafted, had — was interviewed in great detail about their background, and all of that was put on IBM cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And in 1942, or was it f— or early ’43, I’m not sure exactly, the U.S. government had decided that when we liberate <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , the U.S. would need to govern <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Roosevelt did not trust de Gaulle, whom he regarded as an extreme nationalist who would undermine the recovery of Europe, as happened in wor — after World War I, when the French were — insisted on the Versailles treaty. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So, he decided he wasn’t going to let the August 1, 2010 free French govern <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , but there would be a U.S. military government of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , then there would be free election, and let the French decide whether they want de Gaulle or somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So in preparation for the liberation of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , they were going to train a cadre of people to govern <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And even though I didn’t know French, but becu — my card fell out and they decided I was one of these people, so suddenly I was transferred from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Rucker</span> , <span class="REGION">Alabama</span> to <span class="BUILDING">Queens College</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , to learn how to be one of the military government staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">French economics, French history, French law. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">The f — the — the taxation system and so on, so for six months I learned a great deal about <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and learned enough French so I could go to <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span> and pass my French language exam, because at <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span> you had to have two foreign languages if you wanted a PhD. They accepted my German and I passed the French exam, I learned enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And we were about ready to be shipped over to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to work with the English, who had reluctantly accepted the policy of Roosevelt, when Roosevelt and Churchill met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Casablanca</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And there Churchill convinced Roosevelt that the free French, de Gaulle should govern the <span class="REGION">occupied France</span> , that with all the problems that de Gaulle might create, it was better than the English and Americans tr — doing the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">So overnight, about 10,000 bright American soldiers became surplus, and had to be reassigned, and our — overnight, our program was finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I mean, you know, August 1, 2010 when you come to think of it, right in the middle of it, there was no longer any need to train people to govern <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French towns</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And most of the trainees were reassigned to different divisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Many military units had a shortage of people with high IQs. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And this was an opportunity for the army to infuse more people with high IQs. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">But a few were given a choice, because the army was trying to fill some special jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And one of them was a unit that would be dropped to sabotage German facilities, dropped over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And so I was interviewed and told that that was an opportunity for me, but they warned me that the chances of surviving were less than 50 percent, and what would be involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And not that I was particularly heroic and wanting such a — a job, but I didn’t feel as a Jew I could say no, so I — I said yes, when I really wa — wished I didn’t have to say yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">So, as a result, I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Ritchie</span> , the U.S. intelligence training area near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> 
QUESTION:  Can you tell me about the type of training you got at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Ritchie</span> , and who the other soldiers were who you met there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">ANSWER:  Well, shortly after I arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Ritchie</span> it became clear the govern — the army had decided that the program of dropping people didn’t work, the Germans were too well organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So actually I found myself attached to another unit, the psychological warfare division of the U.S. Army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  Now — August 1, 2010
ANSWER:  — and that psychological warfare division had very interesting responsibilities of providing intelligence at the division, as well as at the supreme headquarter level.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">QUESTION:  I want to talk in detail about what you did in PSYOPS, but can you first tell me about who the other people were in your — in the division and in your unit? </span><span class="sentence" id="342">What types of people were recruited for this work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">ANSWER:  In the psychological warfare division, the key person was a Austrian named Captain Hans Harber(ph), and he had become important because he — he married the daughter of — the father of Ted Kennedy and the other Kennedys, who had been ambassador to <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">The way Hans Harber(ph), who was himself a refugee from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> — he became extremely well-known because of his personal history. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Harbie(ph) was the son of a Hungarian Jew named Baeckeshee(ph), who edited the scandal sheet of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and who had shot himself in the foot in World War I, so he wouldn’t have to serve. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And Hans had been very ashamed of his father when the war broke out in — World War II, in ’39, he signed up in the Foreign Legion and was taken prisoner by the Germans and escaped, and wrote a book about the whole situation; his service, his family, and it became a best seller. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So this is how, because of the book, he was invited to lecture all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and Europe, and this is how he met his future wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And then he signed up in the American army, and he dising — distinguished himself in <span class="REGION">North Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">He was a August 1, 2010 journalist who had studied the history of Hitler and his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">So he was appointed to head the psychological warfare units, and was regarded by top level executives as a intelligent, sophisticated analyst of what was going on in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  Now, before you could b — enter psy — the PSYOPS division, did you have to undergo any security clearances, any other special exams?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">ANSWER:  If I did, they h-had all the information about me, so I— I would — I do not recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">My hunch 1s they did make the security clearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">QUESTION:  And what sort of special training did they give you at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Ritchie</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  Well, the training we got was a a-analysis of how the German army was structured; tactically, strategically, chains of command. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">We studied the German propaganda techniques. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">We studied the British American policies that Harber(ph) had worked out with the British, which contrasted to the Hollywood approach, that at the beginning had been kind of adopted, a kind of advertising that we have now, in which you oftentime make claims that are not — that are misleading. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">The British had decided before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dunkirk</span> , that the only way they could win in Europe is to adopt a policy of always telling the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">So at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dunkirk</span> they reported their defeat, the problems of evacuating everybody, the losses, and they broadcast these facts to the Germans over BBC, and the French and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And you know what, they were facing a tremendous loss, had the Germans had succeeded, and continued this August 1, 2010 policy and psychological warfare had adopted the policy of not using propaganda, they — you know, the way Americans advertise.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">QUESTION:  And how did they define your mission? </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Did you have a mission statement?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">ANSWER:  The mission statement was to get the Germans as — first of all, to believe in what they were being told by the U.S. and by the British, and second, to get the Germans to question their regime, on the basis of what was difficult for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">In other words, we’d — we — to simply say the Germans were unfair and unjust and so on, wasn’t going to work, because they felt that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in order to survive, had to do some terrible things, that’s war. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">We had to focus on inconsistencies in German policies from the point of view of the German public and the differentiation between what was good for the general public, and what was good to the me — for the maintenance of the regime.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">QUESTION:  And did you begin any of the actual work while you were still in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> —
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">QUESTION:  — or was this all pre —
ANSWER:  We - we wrote leaflets to be dropped.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">QUESTION:  While you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Ritchie</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="369">August 1, 2010
ANSWER:  While we da — we had to find our way blind, men left all by ourselves somewhere in — in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">We had to write reports to <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">It turned out later on, the unit I was attached to was directly attached to Eisenhower’s supreme headquarters, so we were reporting directly. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Ha-Ha-Harber(ph) obviously was given that job, and so the 10 people he had selected automatically got jobs that had actually impact on public policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">QUESTION:  And when did your unit ship out to Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">ANSWER:  We shipped out in ’43, and were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , there to work with the British and get trained for British American cooperation. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">We had — that time we had not yet attacked Europe at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Omaha Beach</span> , but we were being readied for that event. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">We knew that sooner or later we would invade Europe, but of course we didn’t know when it would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">But that was our training. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And especially writing reports, working with British — actually, we were being investigated carefully by British intelligence. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">They didn’t trust — and I learned later that the Americans, our particular unit was sent to a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> in the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , which was very comfortable, but of course the blitz was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Any time you got hit by a bomb, that was it, a whole <span class="DLF">block</span> would be wiped out by one bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And — but the <span class="BUILDING">villas</span> were run by women — British women soldiers, who did — who fed us, who looked after our clothes, who woke us up in the morning, who made sure that we had, you August 1, 2010 know, were properly fed and had all the comforts. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">What we didn’t realize, that they also were carefully making notes on all of us, and had conversations. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Their job was to make sure that we would be able to function in a proper fashion. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And then, about five weeks after the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , we landed at <span class="DLF">Omaha Beach</span> at a time when it was no longer dangerous, because actually, American troops had liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So we landed and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> waiting, and we drove directly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">QUESTION:  Now, won’t you tell me about what your day to day work was? </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And I know that you were writing leaflets, but what was the source of information, how did you get the information that you we — based on your reports, and how did you decide what went into the reports that you were writing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="388">ANSWER:  Well, the leaflets had to appeal to Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">So what we did is we looked at the tactical situation, and then presented it to the Germans as this is what is happening in the battlefields. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And giving them facts about what was going on, which by 1940 — late 1943 - 1944 was no longer entirely favorable to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I mean, we were still incurring losses, but we were beginning — you know, in <span class="REGION">Africa</span> we actually were able to defeat Rommel and prevent the capture of <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">So, depending on what happened that day, we would write a leaflet, and then we would think of some other things that might make Germans question the policies of their government. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">August 1, 2010
QUESTION:  And how independent were you in terms of what you put in? </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Who had to approve these leaflets?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">ANSWER:  The 10 men working in teams of one or two or thr — not more than that, would prepare a leaflet, or a news broadcast, and they would be reviewed by Captain Harber(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And he had the authority to say yes or no. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">There was a colonel, but the colonel was somebody who had come from the broadcasting industry, who worked well with Harber(ph), but really Harber(ph) was the authority, as somebody who understood what was going on in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">QUESTION:  And how did you disseminate these leaflets once you wrote them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">ANSWER:  Well, we did nothing, they were just — they were just exercises. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">The — I think at times — no, I don’t think, I know at times our products were shown to high officials, probably Patton and Bradley and Eisenhower, to give them an idea what psychological w-warfare we’d be doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">But it was all practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  So none of these ever made it to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , or —
ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">They — they may very well have been dropped. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Certainly I knew that once we were at <span class="BUILDING">Radio Luxembourg</span> , everything we did was being dropped. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I don’t know whether, before we actually occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> , and <span class="BUILDING">Radio Luxembourg</span> , and operated from there, whether the British had decided that simply it was enough to have the BBC, simply because to drop leaflets meant to use air August 1, 2010 power, and every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> we could spare was being used to bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So I sort of doubt that they would drop leaflets, when we had no capacity to occupy, to get Germans to surrender, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So I’m not sure that — there may have been some tactical use used in the radio brod — broadcast, but — but we didn’t get that kind of feedback. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">But I doubt very much that we dropped any leaflets before we were in a capacity to take prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">QUESTION:  So when did your unit shift from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> , and what was the reason for the shift?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  Let’s see, D-Day was’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  June seventh. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">June fourth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">ANSWER:  June fourth, so in July, when we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and then about a week later, we were shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> , which the Germans had evacuated in a hurry. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And they left <span class="BUILDING">Radio Luxembourg</span> operating. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And so we took ov — the allies took over <span class="BUILDING">Radio Luxembourg</span> and turned it into a <span class="BUILDING">broadcasting station</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and to Europe, to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and to many other languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">So, basically we were stationed in the <span class="BUILDING">radio station</span> , which had large <span class="BUILDING">administrative headquarters</span> , and also military bar-barracks of the Luxembourg Army, and the population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luxembourg</span> was very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">After all, they — they were not — had been occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">So, it was a pretty secure <span class="NPIP">place</span> from which to operate. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">August 1, 2010
QUESTION:  And were your <span class="BUILDING">radio stations</span> just conveying tactical information from the <span class="DLF">battlefield</span> , or were you doing anything else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">ANSWER:  We had news programs every hour on the hour in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And <span class="BUILDING">Radio Luxembourg</span> also had a program that claimed to be a — a group of SS dissidents who had decided that the fuehrer needed protection from the corrupt subordinates, like Goering and Goebbels and Himmler, who were really taking advantage of him, and sabotaging his policies, and that there was a need to clean out these traitors, to enable the fuehrer to retake command, to protect the <span class="REGION">Fatherland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And that was the approach of the dissident SS group that a program claimed to be, even though it was broadcast over <span class="BUILDING">Radio Luxembourg</span> only five minutes a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">QUESTION:  And who was taking the role of the SS [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  I don’t know, because they never told us that this program existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">It was so secret that even we didn’t [phone ringing] Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="425">The — this program, which we called the black propaganda, because it was based on a falsehood. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And that unit, I learned later, broadcast gossip that we picked up from prisoners of war, because we were instructed, when interviewing prisoners of war to find out about their home life, what was going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> where they lived, you know, the soldiers who were being taken prisoners were wondering wer — will they be tortured. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And when we interviewed prisoner of war, we first sat them down and says, would you like August 1, 2010 some coffee? </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And we gave them real coffee, and spoke about the fact, you know, Americans still can buy good coffee.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">QUESTION:  Did any of them question why your German was so good, or suspect that —
ANSWER:  The Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  Yeah, the prisoners of war, or did any of them suspect why your German was so good?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  No, th—I-— nota single prisoner ever asked me where — how come I spoke such good German, was I Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="432">They were too scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">They may have suspected that I was Jewish, and some prisoners, of course, without being asked, told me about how opposed they were to the persecution of Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">QUESTION:  Now, you say there was another unit that was doing the black propaganda. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">What — was your propaganda all white and red?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  In other words, part of the information we were asked to provide was for a service that we didn’t know about, because it was so secret, that 1t wasn’t shared with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I think Harber(ph) knew about the black program, but he never shared it with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  Now, did you ever get any reports back about who was actually listening to your radio broadcast, and what effect it had? </span><span class="sentence" id="439">August 1, 2010
ANSWER:  We asked people, and — because severe jail sentences; being sent to the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> , 1f you weren’t 1n the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> ; being sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> was a possible punishment for listening. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">It was strictly forbidden to listen to any enemy broadcast. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And so it was important for us to find out if they had heard, and we found out that a large proportion — I don’t remember statistics — were — had listened at some times, because they wanted to know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And the other thing we did do, is to encourage listenership. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">We not only provided accurate information to the Germans, of exactly what was happening, we provided them with information of what was happening to bombed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , to the extent that we could get information. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And about three months before Christmas, 1944, Harbie(ph) convened a meeting of his 10 soldiers and said, you know, we have a problem what to do on Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Should we broadcast on bri — Christmas we do every day? </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Because after all, our broadcasts are very disturbing to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">The news every day is not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And what should we do on — on Christmas day? </span><span class="sentence" id="449">How to somehow appeal to them? </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And I proposed that we don’t broadcast any news on that day, since it would be bad, but instead interview prisoners of war to send greetings to their loved ones, and broadcast them. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">So the decision was we should announce from months in advance, on Christmas day, we will have 1,000 German prisoners of war personally speak to their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">W-We learned later that this August 1, 2010 news spread and was a way of making people think about agwa — if they had a prisoner of war, maybe my son is among the 1,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  What sort of greetings did they say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  We would ask them to — they had about a little less than a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">They could say who they are, that they’re a prisoner of war and so and so, and they’re in this and this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> that they are feeling well, that they’re healthy, sending greeting to mother and father [indecipherable] and brothers and sisters, and whatever they wanted to say and do through that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Many of them talked about that they’re getting good food and that they’re not being tortured and th —
QUESTION:  And where were these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camps</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Were they all in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> , or [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  No, we would go to the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> and then simply — our unit had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , these news — not — I-like any radio — any <span class="BUILDING">radio station</span> , or <span class="BUILDING">television station</span> , they have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> fully equipped to interview and to broadcast, so that we would actually interview people, and get them in at broadcast, or sometimes have them repeat it so that it would fit our pattern, and gradually accumulated enough personnel using these mobile broadcasting ca — <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">August 1, 2010
QUESTION:  Been talking about the radio, I want to talk about the print aspect. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">You mentioned in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> that you thought that nothing was dropped because of the bombing, but later on it was.</span></p>

QUESTION:  So tell us about the leaflets and how those were sent over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">ANSWER:  Not only leaflets, we also had a newspaper, called “The Front Post,” and they would also be dropped. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">They were a little larger, had more information and were overstated. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And they were dropped. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I don’t think they may — probably every two or three days —
QUESTION:  This is all by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">ANSWER:  By <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> , or by artillery shells.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">QUESTION:  And where were they targeted, for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , or —
ANSWER:  They were targeted on <span class="DLF">front line</span> units of the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Occasionally I think we also dropped leaflets, “The Front Post,” not the surrender bre — leaflets. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">They were only dropped over the <span class="DLF">German lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">But we also would drop newspapers over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German villages</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION:  And were you able to gauge the effectiveness of these leaflets? </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Do you know whether people read them or saved them? </span><span class="sentence" id="472">August 1, 2010
ANSWER:  Well, we would interview people and we certainly would get feedbacks that they were being read, but I had no access to the comprehensive reports, so I — I don’t really know whether we reached 25 percent or 40 percent or 50 percent at different times. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">But certainly the Germans were not effective to completely stop the use of the material that was being dropped.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">QUESTION:  And tell me about the content. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I — you mentioned before that it was —
ANSWER:  Well, I-
QUESTION:  — largely tactical. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Did you talk about any atrocities in these leaflets?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">ANSWER:  The British opposed the idea of focusing on the persecution of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">They took the position that — a-and a correct position — Hitler was again and again reminding Germans that there wouldn’t be a war, except for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And of course, Roosevelt was — was — had his name changed from Rosenfeld(ph) to Roosevelt and that if it weren’t for the Jews, nobody would oppose Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And the British took the position that focusing on the atrocities would only reinforce the idea that this 1s what the war was all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">So you had to get special permission to make any reference to the persecution of the Jews on our news broadcasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  So were there any times when you looked for that special permission, any events that were covered? </span><span class="sentence" id="483">August 1, 2010
ANSWER:  Well, I think there was evi — there was — I think <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was mentioned, but not every day, not even every week.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">QUESTION:  So let me ask about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  I mean, when we started to liberate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , then that was announced.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">QUESTION:  So what —
ANSWER:  But that was very late. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">But in ’44, you couldn’t touch the Jewish issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">QUESTION:  So we mentioned the liberation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , so were you getting information from the Soviets? </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Were they sharing inf — intelligence with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">No, no, the exchange of information with the Soviets on that issue, I think was pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Certainly our leaflets constantly showed the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> , which looked much — their advances were much quicker than our advances, so we had to focus on, soon you will be occupied by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">But we didn’t say, put it this way, we simply said the Russians are advancing, and we are advancing, but we didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">We showed on the map that they were advancing much more quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">QUESTION:  Now I understand there was also information about surrender in these leaflets. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Can you tell —
ANSWER:  About what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">QUESTION:  Surrender.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">August 1, 2010
QUESTION:  Can you talk about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">ANSWER:  Well, we took the position, say to the Germans, you’ve lost the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">If you surrender, you will be — this leaflet will — and this was on every leaflet, is a written guarantee of the condi — [coughing] of the following conditions of surrender: first, you will not be tortured. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">You will be sent in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">You will get three meals a day, identical to the food of the American or British soldiers, which includes; real coffee three times a day; real cigarettes with every meal; meat and fish. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Healthy food, the way allied soldiers are being fed. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">You will be allowed through the Red Cross to communicate with your families, so that if you surrender, you will have contact with your families, which now, very often you don’t have, because the German communication system was not very good in ’44 and ’45. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">That was the surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And these guarantee, they called it guarantee [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Quite a few soldiers, when they surrendered, pulled them out of their shoes, or somewhere in their clothing, to be sure that they would be treated properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And certainly when we interviewed prisoners of war, we did not use the kind of threats or you know, s — intimidation f-for I think many good reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">First of all, tactical information you don’t get from soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">You can sometimes get it from officers, but by the time you get it, all a — it often is no longer valuable. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Because what do we want to know is where do you have your artillery, what kind of weapons do you have, does your unit August 1, 2010 have? </span><span class="sentence" id="513">What plans were made to proceed to defeat us, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">That kind of tactical information, for 24 - 20 - 48 hours might be useful, but with advances of the <span class="DLF">battlefield</span> , it does — it doesn’t become very meaningful. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">So at any rate, while — when you interviewed officers, you would try to learn from them what kind of equipment they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">You didn’t just f— you didn’t focus on that, you also spent a lot of time on their schooling, how they became officers, what their career was, and were they being treated fairly. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">What about their families, how they were doing, their children and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And f — on that basis, people often told us things, how life was terrible, what they were fearful of being arrested simply because they wanted to survive, and that they had been dis — badly treated, and that in particular officer in their command had been very mean and they had suffered this and that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">So that kind of information [indecipherable] obviously, did reach the <span class="BUILDING">black station</span> , but we didn’t know it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">QUESTION:  Did they talk much about their views toward the Nazi party? </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Did any of them have Nazi membership that they denied, or was this simply not covered?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">ANSWER:  Some did, very few. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Most of the people tried to avoid politically sensitive things, but they weren’t sophisticate always to know what was sensitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">So we did get useful information, but we were very circumspect of asking them. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">We — we did ask them, were you a member of the Nazi party, and most of them were. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And then they August 1, 2010 would say, well, understand, everybody had to be a member of the Nazi party. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And then we would learn a little bit about their career. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Some of them were willing to talk, because they thought it might improve the way would — the way would be treated, because they were being treated so well. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And if they were resistant, we withdraw and then send them back, and let them tell their fellow soldiers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> , I didn’t give them any information, but they didn’t do anything to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And thereby enhance our reputation among the prisoners of war, because we would not only interview them — we couldn’t interview everybody who was being captured, there were too many people being captured.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">QUESTION:  Now, I understand that you actually took in one surrender of a general —
ANSWER:  Von Poten, Ernst von Poten.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">QUESTION:  Tell us about that incident.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">ANSWER:  Well, we were always looking for interesting prisoners, so when the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treya(ph</span> ) was about to fall, I was sent, as I often was, to go there and find out how mili — to write a report on the — how a military government functioned after the first de — day or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And see if there were any interesting prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">So when I got to Treya(ph), the captain who — in charge of military government, been maybe there 24 hours and 48 hours, and had found a German who was willing to be a coordinator between the military government and the German administrative August 1, 2010 system. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And he had apparently not been a Nazi, so the captain had developed trust. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And when I ask about interesting prisoners, he said, well ba — you better talk to — I have the name now, but I don’t remember just now what the name is. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So I came to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and he said, oh yes, there’s a general who would like to surrender, but he’s afraid of being taken prisoner by some enlisted group, because they might mistreat him. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">He would like to be — he’s hiding, hoping to get arrested by officers, and I know where he 1s and he told me that’s what he would like to do, and if you are interested, I will tell you where he 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">That was kind of a silly, you know — but I got the instructions and so on, and talked more. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">He didn’t know much about the general himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">My driver, who was married, felt this was a trick to get us into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> above <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treya(ph</span> ) where there might still be German soldiers that had been roaming around and would attack us, and this is not a reliable story. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">But I had become convinced that it was real, at least there’s a good chance, and so I said, let’s go and get him and he had — my driver had no choice, I — I happened to b-be one grade above him. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">So, we went with our regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">broadcasting truck</span> , and followed directions and drove up into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and after about maybe half an hour, I saw a man walking with a — a dog and von Poten had been described to me of having a dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And so we stopped.

QUESTION:  [indecipherable] take a call right here. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">August 1, 2010
ANSWER:  This time I’m taking [break]
QUESTION:  Okay, this begins the next track with the interview with Joseph Eaton.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">ANSWER:  Well, a man who looked like the general that was described, and the fact that he was walking with a dog, we stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And I opened the <span class="DLF">window</span> and said, General von Poten? </span><span class="sentence" id="550">He looked up and said, jawohl? </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Sort of, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And I said, I understand you want to surrender? </span><span class="sentence" id="553">He said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I said, well, I was sent by <span class="BUILDING">supreme headquarters</span> to take your surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Thank you, he said, I’m glad how — that you got the message. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And here is, about 200 meters from here is a <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> in which we have been living since I was fired from my post a month ago, or two months ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">So please, let’s sit down comfortably in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So he walked and we drove and he went into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and brought out his wife and introduced her. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And so my driver was suspicious, he didn’t go in, and I went into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we sat down. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">But the small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was crowded with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> covered with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed sheets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And we sat down on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> and started to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">He pulled out documents signed by the chief — the commander of the German army, General Keitel, informing him that the fuehrer had decided that the army needed more young people; they weren’t sufficiently aggressive to push ahead, and for that reason, in spite of his good service, he was being retired. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">He appealed the forced retirement, but the appeal was denied. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">All of this was in correspondence signed by no one less than the counterpart August 1, 2010 of Eisenhower, the chief commander of the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">So, I took those documents and he said he decided, even though he was no longer a soldier, he said, I’m a civilian now, but he decided that as a former general, he might be considered someone to be made a prisoner of war, he hoped this would not be the case, but this is why he let the message be transmitted that he was ready to be in touch with the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">He indicated in conversations about the war, I learned — he and I talked about his career. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">So, he said, I became a soldier before World War I, and served in the Austrian army, and he told me the different battles. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And then stayed in the Austrian army and then when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , he became part of the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And he was involved in the war against <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and was in-injured near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> , and for a year and a half was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And after he had recuperated, the army assigned him to be the governor of the French city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Metz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And he showed me documents there, his appointment. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And he indicated that he had problems with the head of the Nazi party in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Metz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Metz</span> is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French city</span> , occupied mostly by German speaking people, so it’s part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace-Lorraine</span> that had been transferred after World War I, to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And he said, I had problems with the local Nazi leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">When I got the job, they offered me several <span class="BUILDING">villas</span> , but they were all taken from Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And my wife and I didn’t want to live in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that was full of tears, so we didn’t take them, we went into an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">He may have realized that August 1, 2010 I was Jewish, but he didn’t ask me. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And then I was in — had trouble with the Nazi party leader, because I took the position that for security purposes, we had to choo — treat the local population well. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">So I went to French music events, <span class="BUILDING">French theater</span> , not only the <span class="BUILDING">German theater</span> , and the Nazi leader felt that was not a proper thing to do, for the commanding general to go to a French theater production. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And he complained to Himmler and asked that he be dismissed, and apparently succeeded; Himmler supported his retirement. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">All of this was in documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So, I se — I then ask him, well, what you — what would you recommend that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> do today? </span><span class="sentence" id="583">He said, we’ve lost the war, we have to accept unconditional surrender, because every day major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German villages</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> are devastated, and we are not gaining anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">It’s — we’ve lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">So I said, would you be willing to tell this to the German population if you had a chance? </span><span class="sentence" id="586">He says, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And then I told him that he was a lucky man, that he had the opportunity to do this right now, because there was a <span class="BUILDING">broadcasting station</span> in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="588">So he got caught, and I gave him a pen and paper, and I found he had great difficulty writing a script, so I offered to write it, help him draft it. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Well, what are you going to say”? </span><span class="sentence" id="590">He said okay, and I drafted a speech, thinking in terms of what is he likely to say? </span><span class="sentence" id="591">So, you know, he wasn’t advocating to surrender, because <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had done terrible things. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">He — he had no regrets about moving into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and whatever he-helped in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and you know, every August 1, 2010 command was one that he tried to execute. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">He simply was willing to surrender because it was better for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="594">So he modified my remarks, his German was much better than mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And then I said let’s — I sat him into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> doing exactly what you are doing, and we listened to the broadcast. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And then I had him do it two more times, because it didn’t sound as good as I thought it wou — should be. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And afterwards I told him that he should put on his uniform, and asked him if he had any weapons, and the only thing he had was a sword and a pistol, and I took both of those. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And he dressed in his army uniform and I said, well, I have to take you to <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> to — for them to decide whether you are to become a prisoner of war, or a civilian and could be treated as a civilian. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And so he gave me more papers to document his status. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And put him into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> late at night, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">front seat</span> , I sat in the back because again, I didn’t trust him to sit in back of me, and drove to <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="601">We got there about four o’clock in the morning and I called my commanding officer in his <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> and told him that I got a general. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And Harber(ph), who had a good sense of humor says, Eaton, why don’t you drive more carefully? </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And after telling him a little bit more about the general, I said, well, why don’t we h-have breakfast with him, because I think everybody else here would like to meet him. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">The Americans had not captured a general up to now on the <span class="REGION">western front</span> like the <span class="REGION">Russians side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And there was a — well, you n — as you know, August 1, 2010 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> a Russian general who actually then organized troops to fight with the Russians against Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">So, at about five o’clock, we — the cook had prepared good breakfast, bacon and eggs and trimmings, and the colonel and majors and captains were all assembled. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">There was one thing that I forgot to tell you, I had been told that the general was terribly worried about being taken prisoner by enlisted men, he thought he would be mistreated. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">So I decided I would make myself an officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">That was a risky thing to do, to impersonate an officer in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">But you know, we had a great deal of freedom in my cir — in other words, there was nobody telling me what to do when I went to the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">It was my decision to decide where, which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to go to, whom to interview, which American officers to ask for cooperation. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">So, before going up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> , early in the morning, about eight or 8:30, I asked Germans where there was a <span class="BUILDING">drugstore</span> , and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">drugstore</span> , which wasn’t open yet, rang the bell. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">The druggist answered when he saw, I guess, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military truck</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and looked worried, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And I said, I need a Band- Aid. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Well, that was an easy request. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">So he immediately got a box of Band-Aids. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And ask him for a scissors and I cut two pieces of the rubberized part of the Band- Aid, which is white on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and put it on the helmet and promoted myself to captain. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And so, when I took the general into, you know, custody, I introduced myself as Captain Eaton, who had been sent by <span class="BUILDING">supreme headquarters</span> to accept his August 1, 2010 surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">So, you know, he felt sort of pleased that somehow supreme headquarters — and that may have had a fact — an impact on his re-readiness to cooperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">So I had told Harbie(ph) on the phone what I had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And when I arrived everybody treated me as Captain Eaton, and — and my driver was sort of amazed that I — nobody criticized me, and then afterwards a decision was made to clear with <span class="BUILDING">supreme headquarters</span> what to do with the general, that we would use him to work for us at Radio Luxembourg, and in the — the day or two that this might take, we put up the general in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , and my job, I was in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with him, was to take him for walks, see to it that he got his rations, and talk to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And then introduce him, bring him to different officers who wanted to talk to him, for whatever information they were interested in. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And after da — a day or two, nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">So I was able to talk to Captain Harber(ph), he said well, we are having problems with this man, and I don’t know what’s going to happen, but it doesn’t look good, because some of the senior officials in Eisenhower’s <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> are concerned over the fact that you took this general in <span class="REGION">Third Army territory</span> and brought him to <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> , when according to army rules, which you didn’t know and I didn’t know, you f — all prisoners of war have to be cleared through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And you didn’t clear him through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> , you took him directly to <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And some people are talking about court-martialing not August 1, 2010 only you, but me and the colonel. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">So, it took two weeks before a decision was made not to court-martial us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">QUESTION:  What happened to the broadcast?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">ANSWER:  Nothing, it wasn’t used. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Apparently, there was enough fear among the upper level staff that Patton would get furious if someone that was captured in his <span class="REGION">area</span> was not — did not — he did not have the opportunity to handle the whole situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And for that reason, rather than get into another controversy between Patton and Bradley and Eisenhower — and there had been many controversies between them, I mean, they — Patton was very egocentric — the decision was made to return the captain to where we had taken him prisoner and then to notify the French, the free French, who had been asked to move into Treya(ph) as the Third Army was advancing, to come up and arrest him. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">So my job, they says — an-an — and — and — and they said, we decided you should do the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">So here was my — I-I was given another driver, and it was my job to find the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I had taken him prisoner.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">QUESTION:  I want to shift the focus now. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">We’ve been talking about your role as an American soldier and I want to talk about your attitudes as a Jewish soldier, and the war at this point is winding down. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">I understand that you took advantage of the fact that you had use of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to actually explore and see what happened to your own family. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">August 1, 2010
ANSWER:  Yeah, well, shortly before being sent overseas, apparently army policy was to naturalize enemy aliens, especially people like myself, who had a very high security position. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">So I was given a three day leave to travel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> to go before a judge who — I don’t think he ever tested me as normally citizenship people ar — application for citizenship, with being in the army, it — the whole thing was about five minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And the — so I had become a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">The — and I was a citizen in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and — when serving over 1-in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">The — obviously w-we all knew what was — that the Germans were murdering Jews in large numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Exactly what was happening, we didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">You heard rumors of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , you heard — you knew that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> many people were tortured, and some people were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">But you didn’t know any of the full details at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And in my unit of 10 people, I think there were two who were not Jewish, all the others were. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And we didn’t talk about being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">There were German refugees like myself and Captain Harber(ph), we knew had been born into a Jewish family, but we didn’t know what his sympathies were, that he had been converted. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And none of my fellow soldiers and I ever talked about the Jewish problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">They didn’t seem to ever talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And so, it — it’s something you kept to yourself, but I was very much aware, not only of what was — we knew was happening to Jews, that they had been murdered in large numbers in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , that — that we had heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">But I also August 1, 2010 knew that — what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , so whenever there was news available, I was particularly interested in. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And so, as a result, I took a special interest in Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And one of my assignments was to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as soon as we occupied a few <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And wherever I went, I would ask, are any — what happened to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And the — Monschau didn’t have Jews, but in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> , which we occupied around oc — middle of October, and I arrived there maybe two or three days after occupation, I learned from the public relations officer that one Jew had bi — had survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And the army had seen to it that he would getas—a reasonable quarter, and he gave me the address. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">So, I— you know, I — wasn’t difficult to find out where to go, because you asked people, and he was put into a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that had been — the upper part had been destroyed, but the first floor, the four <span class="DLF">walls</span> were standing, there were no <span class="DLF">windows</span> , the <span class="DLF">door</span> could not be closed, but it was better than most, you know, I-living in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And he had put a big sign on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , Jude. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And so when I came in and introduced myself, he was very happy to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">He had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and insisted I sit on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> , and he stood, in his warm clothing, he had no gloves. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">So I gave him my gloves and a scarf, and we talked about what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And he explained to me that just before deportation, the Germans deported all the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> , but because they had Christian friends, he and his wife were able to move into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> and be hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">August 1, 2010 Unfortunately, his wife got caught in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and his — was deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">He — but he survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And he described himself as being a member of the B’nai Brith and didn’t know any Hebrew, but he had been to <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and knew something about prayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And he thought that probably he would be safe now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">But — and that’s why he put the sign up, and he felt that he was — he didn’t know of any other Jew who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Well, apparently the people in military government looked after him subsequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">He was seep — he got a job in military government as somebody who could be trusted, and ultimately turned out to be a member of the city council and became head of a new Jewish community, because there were a few survivors who drifted back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> and so the province decided to facilitate the development of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , and he actually became its head, I think, for the rest of his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">QUESTION:  Did he have any details on where people were deported to, and what happened to them after they were deported?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">ANSWER:  He knew they were deported, he didn’t know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">He knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , but he didn’t — the details were not known to him, it’s ju — they had disappeared, and he was really worried that they might not come back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="673">QUESTION:  Now, you mentioned <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> ; you yourself visited; you talk about that visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">August 1, 2010
ANSWER:  What?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="675">QUESTION:  The visit to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> that you made.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Now, when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> was liberated, by that time much of my work was to — well, nearly all of my work was to visit different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that we had liberated, to write reports for supreme headquarters. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">So I decided I would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">All I had to do was tell Captain Harber(ph) I’d like to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , he said fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I got orders [indecipherable] you know, within a few hours, and a driver, and off we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">So that’s how I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , to write reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">QUESTION:  What were your main impressions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">ANSWER:  Well, it was impossible to describe. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I mean, you drove into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and you were greeted with piles of corpses, maybe up as high as this — the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">QUESTION:  About how many days after liberation was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">ANSWER:  That was five, six days. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">When I arrived, I inquired how — how the former prisoners were being dealt with, and I quickly discovered that Jews had succeeded to be in a special <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , even though originally, the Americans had decided that <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> — the people liberated, Poles would go into a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and Yugoslavs and Germans, pris — inmates, and then they discovered that the Jews didn’t want to be with the Poles and didn’t want to be with the Yugoslavs, and they simply refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">August 1, 2010 So, the local commander said okay, I'll give you your own <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And — and that happened within — on the first day. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">So I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish barrack</span> and introduced myself, and we sat down, I said, what are the problems? </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Are you getting enough food? </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And they said, well, we’re getting our share. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And — but they were complaining about the administrative problems they had of getting recognized as a nationality. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">So we discussed the political aspects, pointed out to them that the British government had a strong, vested interest in preventing the establishment of Jews as a Separate nationality, because of what was th — their commitment in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , that they had made a decision that they made a mistake in 1917, there were many more Arabs than Jews, and they didn’t — they didn’t want to lose support of the Muslims, and so they had made an agreement, and until that can be overturned, the British were pushing very hard to oppose recognition of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">But on the other hand, Jews shouldn’t be worried, and simply, they had the power to refuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">They should insist on whatever they want, because there was strong political support of their position in the American Jewish community, and to some extent in the British community. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">So they had done the right thing and they should be very assertive and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">So we talked about that, basically was mos — much of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">In addition to getting information for my reports, that was the focus of my visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">After all, I only spent maybe four or five hours in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">August 1, 2010
QUESTION:  Now, I know that one of your reports was on the children of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Did you actually go into the <span class="BUILDING">children’s barrack</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="704">QUESTION:  And can you talk about your reaction when you saw it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">ANSWER:  Well, ah — the — first of all, many children were with adults, either because they were related, and I couldn’t quite understand how they survived, or because they were being looked after by adults who wanted to protect them, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">So, the children and [indecipherable] adolescents lived for — with the — with the adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I don’t recall that there was a <span class="BUILDING">children’s barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708">There were not many children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="709">QUESTION:  And did any of the Jewish prisoners ask you to take messages back? </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Did they put [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Well, a few, even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> would give me letters, but not many. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">I wasn’t there long enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">It wasn’t like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And so the — I think I got two or three letters in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I was there for a very short period of time, because you know, I had to bring back reports to <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">For all I know, those reports were shared with upper level command. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I couldn’t tell you exactly who read them, but you know, like any reports coming in from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , sometimes they will reach — I’m sure some of them were read by Eisenhower. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And I did talk in these reports not only about conditions in the — and how the prisoner of war were August 1, 2010 organized and how they had been able to kill some of the guards, but I also talked about the fact that there were special problems with Jews who didn’t want to be with Poles, and certainly didn’t want to be with Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And those reports went to upper levels, whatever their impact — impact might have been, but certainly the American high level command became aware of the fact that this was a very touchy problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">QUESTION:  And then what other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> did you visit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">ANSWER:  I—I visited <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , and I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> was very unexpected, because when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> was liberated in late April, and the news came across, it was in the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">QUESTION:  Before we get there, let me just ask one question en route. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">At this point, what information did you have about your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="724">When did you — where they had gone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">ANSWER:  I kn-knew nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="726">QUESTION:  So did you know that German Jews were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , or was just —
ANSWER:  There was a possib — I knew that many German Jews were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="727">So the possibility that they might have gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> was there, and we knew Jews had survived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">So, as soon as that happened, I went to my commanding officer and told him I’d like to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> to get August 1, 2010 the names of the liberated people. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Did he think this was a good idea, even though it was in the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And he thought it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And so, within hours I had orders, I think they were signed by General Bradley, to go into the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> , to the libera — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , to carry out the instructions of the theater commander, that was Eisenhower, that f— were my orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Had a ja — had a driver, and went to the <span class="BUILDING">commissary</span> and stocked up with gasoline and food to the hilt, and off we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I had been, as a child, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marienbad</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marianské Lazné</span> , which in Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">So we drove through that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community,</span> where I remembered the f — you know, a few <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="735">We didn’t encounter any Russian troops, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> was pretty close to as far as the Russians got. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">The Americans — Patton had actually gotten to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , and then later had to withdraw from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> because of an agreement that Eisenhower had made with Stalin that <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> would be turned over to them, so — but at that time, the first time we encountered Russians was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And we were not allowed to enter the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> because — the explanation was there was a typhus epidemic, and we would have to wait until it was under control. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">So for about two days, we found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep, we waited til the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was open, and then over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> and ask for the commanding officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Well, being the only American I’m taken immediately to the right <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and was invited into the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where he was August 1, 2010 sitting, a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And he’s surrounded by a few people talking Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And I showed him my orders and he called over a translator to look at my orders and tell him what they were, and saw the signature of my officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">So, pat me down, and then said [phone ringing] — so, it’s easier to talk on the phone without the hearing aid, because apparently they interfere with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">So, b-before he answered me about the information, he said, through this interpreter, why are the Americans killing Russian soldiers? </span><span class="sentence" id="744">I said, that’s impossible, they are our allies, they liberated, th-they — he said, well, I read it in “Pravda.” </span><span class="sentence" id="745">I said, I certainly will check into it, and we [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">I didn’t ask him for a copy of the report in “Pravda.” </span><span class="sentence" id="747">It didn’t — after that exchange, he dropped the matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And he said, I s— I— I’m sending somebody to talk to the head of the Jewish community, so they will get ready, to get the names ready for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And he poured a glass of liquor and offered me a big glass like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And I realized that I could never keep up with him, so I cur — it occurred to me how to get out of it, I said, I— I have a very sad problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">He says, what’s the problem? </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I have a ruptured thorax, and alcohol will irritate it, I can’t drink anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Well, he felt very bad about me, but he wanted to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> had been filled with bottles. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">I mean, the alc — the conc — the alcoholism among the upper level command was apparent. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And underneath the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> were radios that had been confiscated, so he offered me a August 1, 2010 radio, which I explained to him I had one, so I didn’t want to deprive others of the radio, so I didn’t take a radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">But then I was taken by a Russian soldier to meet Leo Baeck, who was in charge of the Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And we sat down on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="759">QUESTION:  Did you know who Leo Baeck was ahead of time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="760">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I knew who he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">I didn’t know he was the head of the Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">I didn’t know had — he had survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I knew about him as a Reform rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , but I knew nothing else about him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">QUESTION:  Tell me about your meeting with Rabbi Baeck.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">ANSWER:  Well, the fact that he survived was almost incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">He said, well, the Germans apparently decided I should live. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Because so many other people were killed, some — some rabbis were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="769">They obviously thought I was — would be of use to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And he was describing a little bit of how the camp was organized, that Jews were doing all the work, they been paid for the work, and with this money they would get their very limited rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And they could use that money and I — I got some, you know, samples of the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And he had a register of all persons who had ever been there, including information when they were deported or — or murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And I got a copy, which I took with me, and delivered to <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And I presume this may have been used to evacuate the liberated people, which happened very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">August 1, 2010
QUESTION:  Did you have a chance to go through the names? </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Did any sound familiar to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">ANSWER:  Oh yes, I mean, I saw — the only one I saw was my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">She had been there, and I learned from somebody who knew her, when I mentioned this, that she starved to death, she died of malnutrition. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">She was 72 years of age. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">As did many other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">If they didn’t have good jobs, where they could steal food, they had real pro — survival problems, because the rations were rations that did not susta — allow you to sustain normal health.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">QUESTION:  Tell me, what was Leo Baeck’s reaction when you came in — and I assume you identified yourself as having been a German Jewish refugee coming back with the Americans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">ANSWER:  Well, I mean, he — Leo Baeck at that time said he wasn’t sure what would happen, but he — he didn’t want to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , because he knew the community, he was among the last to be deported, so he — the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> had been burned or destroyed; the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish community center</span> , there was — there was no community, so he had — he didn’t want to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And he said, that’s true of most of the German Jews here. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">But some did want to go back because they had property and so on, but he had nothing left in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">QUESTION:  Did he ask for your help with anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="787">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">August 1, 2010
QUESTION:  Did anybody else that you meet there ask for —
ANSWER:  The only thing people ask for is to deliver letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">They recognized apparently that — I explained to people how I got there, I said I was — that the Russians were willing to let us take the names, but 1t was — the Russians were 1n charge, so they realized I couldn’t do anything, since it was the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And apparently the Russians had treat — treated them — allowed them to organize the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp —</span> well, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was already organized under the Germans, but now they treated them with great respect, and they looked after the sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And Russian physicians would be available to provide treatment, to provide medicines. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">In other words, they wa — they were being given services by the Russians within the limits of what the Russians had, which was damn little.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="793">QUESTION:  Now, well, let’s go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">When you mentioned that the registrar, that register that Leo Baeck had, mentioned dates that people were deported, did he know himself where the deportations were going? </span><span class="sentence" id="795">Did he know that these [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Yeah, he knew — he knew they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="796">QUESTION:  And did he know the ramifications?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="797">ANSWER:  Yeah, he knew they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and he knew that they would — they would die there. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">I mean, he said, this was — the Germans tried to misrepresent the August 1, 2010 Red Cross, that this was a — a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , self-governed by the Jews to — while they should not be in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they could be in a community of their own, but this was just a showpiece. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And so he — he certainly outlined this, and that the — the Nazis would punish Jews severely if they violated any of the rules and some Jews were — were hanged or shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> became overcrowded, they would deport some people to make room for others to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And as far as he was concerned, there was no future for German Jewry. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">That he did say. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And he later on made that statement publicly, in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="804">QUESTION:  So how long did you remain in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="805">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , I think I was there for a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">We did not spend the night there. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">My job was to get the information, go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And they were pretty quick in give — giving us the names.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="809">QUESTION:  And when you got back, and you presented the names in the register, did — was there any reaction among the people in your unit when they saw all the lists of deported, and that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="810">ANSWER:  Again, while there were many Jews in the system, they were all afraid to talk about the Jewish problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="811">QUESTION:  And they weren’t looking on their own in private to see if their families were there? </span><span class="sentence" id="812">August 1, 2010
ANSWER:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">I’m sure they were interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">I mean, I am sure my commanding — I’ve never discussed it with Harber(ph), how b — when I — but when I think back of it, how come any time I wanted something, I got it? </span><span class="sentence" id="815">I was a sergeant, but I could get anything from Harber(ph), and because of the fact that he personally was very sympathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">But again, to protect himself, he didn’t want to be viewed as a spokesperson for the Jews, especially since officially he wasn’t even Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="817">QUESTION:  And at this point —
ANSWER:  I mean, later on, 20 years later, he wrote a book about <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , a very positive book about king — about how <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> was working and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">But this was the first time that Hans had ever even officially discussed his Jewish background. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And later on I did meet him socially, and he spoke very openly about the fact that he — his father had converted out of purely op-opportunistic purposes, but he certainly got no Jewish background, other than what he acquired later on as he grew up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="820">QUESTION:  And at this period of time, just as the war was ending, were you able to communicate — correspond at all to your brothers who were in the Jewish brigade?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="821">ANSWER:  Well, in the army I was able to use military mail to write to my brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">There was no longer any possibility of writing to my parents after 19 — after December seventh — no, no, that’s not ri— eighth, 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And I wasn’t in the army at that time anyhow, but there was no mail between the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="824">But there certainly August 1, 2010 was mail between the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="825">So I corresponded maybe once a week with my brothers in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and we continued to correspond through army mail, which was pretty efficient. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">So I knew that my oldest brother had been stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> in 1944, in the Jewish brigade, and I knew his address. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">So I would send him copies of some of my reports about what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And our reports, I think in today’s army would, at least for weeks or months be considered confidential or secret, but security concerns didn’t exist at that time, so I had no qualms about sen — taking a report and sending my brother a copy. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And then he translated the report in Hebrew and it got published in “Haaretz,” because in addition to being a soldier, “Haaretz” had asked him to be a — what — you know, a —a part time correspondent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">QUESTION:  So which reports of yours, on what topics, were republished in “<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haaretz</span> ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="831">ANSWER:  I don’t — I would have to look at the — at the actual reports. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">I think the report about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , and I think the report — I mean, part of the report on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , and I think <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , which had some Jewish content.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="833">QUESTION:  Now we - go back to the list of names. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">At this period of time, I know the Jewish chaplains were collecting names and trying to reunite families. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">Did the list ever make it to the Jewish chaplains? </span><span class="sentence" id="836">August 1, 2010
ANSWER:  Oh, ’'m s — I’m sure they — I mean, I don’t know what happened to the list, but considering the efficiency of the army, and considering, for example, what happened to one of my mother’s cousins that survived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> — I mean in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="837">The various allied governments were very quick in evacuating the [indecipherable] to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , you know, where you could — naturally, you couldn’t send — Jews didn’t want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , Jews didn’t want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="838">So — and most Russian Jews were able to claim that they were Polish, and maybe they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">At any rate, I don’t remember that Jews were among those forced by the allies to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">So, I can’t tell you what happened to the list. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">But keep in mind, we had what, two or three — Rabbi na- nad — Nadich, or something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="842">QUESTION:  Oh, Judah Nadich?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="843">ANSWER:  Nadich, and maybe one — one or two other, that’s all the rabbis were available in the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And they were very busy men. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">They had to conduct services, and they were part of high level of command. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">So they had problems getting around, as I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And so my hunch 1s that when the means became available, they were transmitted to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">But I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="849">QUESTION:  Now, after V-E Day, your job changed a bit —
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">August 1, 2010
QUESTION:  — with the occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">What was your new job?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="852">ANSWER:  Well, after V-J Day, and even before ge — V-J Day, once we entered <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in October ’44, the newspaper of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> and the newspaper later on of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> was shut down. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And Harber(ph) convinced Eisenhower that we should establish a free press in German, which ultimately would be turned over to the Germans, after they saw how a free press functions. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And that was approved. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">So he had approval to establish 10 German newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="856">QUESTION:  And why did they select the number 10?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="857">ANSWER:  And they selected them in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , to cover whole <span class="REGION">regions</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="858">So there were two in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> , one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , and the other one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="859">But when we occupied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> , we didn’t find a <span class="BUILDING">printing plant</span> that operated. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">So, 1-it had to be moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> , but 1t was published as the Regensburger(ph) Post. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">So, in — the Munich press ultimately became the Siddeutsche Zeitung. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">It — It was, I think [indecipherable] but later on 1t became — when it became German, they changed the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">It is today <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ’s — one of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ’s top newspapers, like “The New York Times.” </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And Hans Harber(ph) actually stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after occupation ended and the Germans took over, to remain as editor of the Suddeutsche Zeitung for two or three years to get it going. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">So Harber(ph) decided he — he had 10 men, so each of us was given a newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And I think two people August 1, 2010 had occasionally written articles for newspapers, but none of us had been editors of a newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">But that’s how ha — Harbie(ph) operated, so overnight I suddenly became editor of a newspaper.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="868">QUESTION:  Now, were you this — just the editor? </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Were you also the only staff writer? </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Was there anybody working for you, or [indecipherable] operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="871">ANSWER:  Well, I had no staff, I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> to-together with a administrative staff, there were two officers and three or four enlisted man whose job was to, first of all, find <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> , and to have a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> of food for the four or five men and the — and me, as the editor. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">Basically, that unit existed to make sure I had transportation and food and able to run the newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">So my — I decided that it — that the building of the press was well preserved, the editor had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> there, a very big <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And I decided that I might as well live right in the newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">And my commanding officer thought that, you know, it was a good idea, so I didn’t live with the other enlisted men in quarter that they had established; I had my own <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> in the newspaper, so I could be on top of everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="876">QUESTION:  And how often did the paper come out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="877">ANSWER:  Once a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="878">QUESTION:  And where’d you get the articles? </span><span class="sentence" id="879">August 1, 2010
ANSWER:  So-— so the articles, the — the press was based on a very small staffing, because we didn’t have much, all we had is this one — the editors. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">So what was done is that all 10 <span class="BUILDING">newspapers</span> would get the national, international news, which was produced by Harber(ph) and his staff in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Nauheim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="881">So, since each of the <span class="BUILDING">newspapers</span> was four pages, there were three pages of national and international news, and a local page. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">As editor my job was to get information for the local page. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">And I decided what goes to the local page. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">Harber(ph) didn’t have time to even look at the local pages.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="885">QUESTION:  Do you remember the types of articles —
ANSWER:  Oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="886">QUESTION:  — subjects of any of your articles?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="887">ANSWER:  So, it was up 1-1n — the other three pages would be speeches by the president [indecipherable] speeches by Eisenhower, speeches by Churchill and major news about what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and so on, but was all written in Eisenhower’s headquarter. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And this was the first time I di — I flew, because they sent a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">helicopter</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Na</span> — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> , pick me up, take me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Nauheim</span> to get the material on Wednesday for the Friday’s newspaper, fly me back, just for that purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And it was a big scary, because these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Piper Cubs</span> are not well put together. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">I mean, you — when you sit in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Piper Cub</span> there are two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> , the pilot and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And you can August 1, 2010 look down on the side of your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> because it was open, so you can look down. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">And you flew very low. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">The Piper Cubs don’t go up high — very high, so we were very close to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And so that happened every week, and I think once I was asked to drive in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> , and I drove myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And so at any rate, that’s how they got the — the main contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">Now, the local c-contact, that was entirely up to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">So you had to think of stories that would appeal to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And so I would have stories about food rationing, I would have stories about local military government. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">I would have stories about opening of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="900">I would have stories about some interesting <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> case. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">I also — I learned that there was a Jewish girl who had been hidden by Germans, by 20 different Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">So I — when I heard about it, I looked for her and I found out where she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">Her name, I think, was Sonja(ph) Navay(ph), and she was 16 years of age, and she had been blonde. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Her mother and father were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">She didn’t know where they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">But friends of the family had hidden her and then turned her over to others because they felt it was too dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">So 20 different German families, so I made that a feature story. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And it was on my page, and then Harber(ph) decided that was a good story, so that became — was reprinted in all the other newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">So some of the stories I wrote were copied, and I came to the conclusion that the German governor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> was not too sympathetic towards Jews, because he urged that the policy that had been adopted that Jews August 1, 2010 would get double rations, because they had been so deprived and emaciated, he felt that was unfair. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And he lobbied in favor of giving Jews the same amount of food as everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">So I decided he has to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="912">QUESTION:  Did he ne —
ANSWER:  So, I mean, I — I wrote articles that criticized his policies, and I don’t know whether that’s why he ultimately was fired, but he was fired.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">QUESTION:  Did anyone at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> know that you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="915">QUESTION:  Did the Germans know you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="916">ANSWER:  By that time they knew wa — they — they knew I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">First of all, the editor that I replaced was a smart German, a Swiss German. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And, you know, when people asked me, I told them, so — so I didn’t go into many details about my family, anything else [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">So th-the second reason why it became clear I was Jewish is because I featured stories about ous — the Jewish — the reorganization of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Degendorf</span> , where there has been no Jews, but DPs and how they were operating, or marriage of Jews in — of a Jew in some community. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And the fact that it turned out that the secretary that had been found for me, somebody who was very good in German, turned out to be a German Jewish woman who hu — who’s — had been a Polish nationality deported to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and there she was able to August 1, 2010 hide that she was Jewish and survived as a Pole. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And she was hired as a Pole, but when she discovered that I was very interested in Jewish affairs and wrote reports on the subject, she confessed that she had been hiding her Jewish identity because she really didn’t think that the — didn’t think you could trust the Americans, since she had some early interactions with American officers who tried to pressure her to sleep with them, and she felt they were just like the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="922">QUESTION:  Now, this time when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> and said that you also visited Hitler’s birthplace, and start to [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Well, that was — when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Braunau</span> was occupied by the Americans, I immediately said, I gotta go there and do a story about Hitler’s birthplace, so I drove there and just went to the <span class="BUILDING">military government headquarters</span> and there I met a Mr. Fagas(ph), who looked a lot like Hitler, but he had been a socialist, had never been in the party. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">He was appointed acting mayor. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">So I talked to him for a while and asked where — where’s Hitler’s birthplace? </span><span class="sentence" id="925">He took me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">It was a lib — <span class="BUILDING">public library</span> , had been a <span class="BUILDING">public library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="927">So I went into the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and there were a lot of books and also the local newspaper had been published there, so they had a photographic division, a lot of German photographs. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">So I took a lot of the photographs that I thought would be of interest, many of which I gave to, you know, delivered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Nauheim</span> , but I kept some that interested me. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And I also took some books of Hitler August 1, 2010 that — like a copy of “Mein Kampf” and photographic books of the fuehrer that came from his <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And I had the <span class="BUILDING">printing office</span> make me a printed message that it was taken from Hitler’s birthplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And then I met with the — Mi-Miss Fagas(ph), and said, what are you going to do with Hitler’s birthplace? </span><span class="sentence" id="932">He says, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">It’s certainly something you have to deal with. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">I said, I have an idea, let’s make it into a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> of the outra — atrocities of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">He liked that idea, and so he said, all right, we'll do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And, what are you going to exhibit? </span><span class="sentence" id="937">Well, he said, that — we have to get information of things that could be put there, like maybe the Nuremburg laws, and some of the info — illustrations of Nazi’s atrocities. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And I offered to get some placards that could be exhibited, and when I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> , I got ahold of the local Catholic priest and told him that there was a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and I was wondering where there were some Biblical phrases that he could think of that would appropriately describe the evil of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">So —
QUESTION:  What — what sort of phrases did he come up with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="940">ANSWER:  He came up by — in my — the material I gave you, the actual text from the Bible was selected, and I had them print it up on a large placard, and then took the material and they framed it, they — I think they framed it for me in Straubing. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">The — the Germans who had been running the <span class="BUILDING">Nazi printing plant</span> became my employees, because there was no one else. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">In other words, we didn’t replace them. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">August 1, 2010 And they were very cooperative. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">I never — no one ever asked me about being Jewish, but I’m sure they all knew, and because you know, obviously, I spoke such good German, and my secretary, who was bi — by that time was known she was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">And there also was a incident, my fa — my secretary, after she was freed, she had to fill out a questionnaire and she was afraid to reveal that she was not Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">She didn’t trust the Germans, the — our officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">So she filled it out according to her false papers, not realizing that she was providing false information. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And when she openly admitted that she was of German background and of Jewish background and not Polish, the — one of the — the sia — the security people decided she had violated the law, she had falsified her identity, and charged her for having done so. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">I talked to them, and they says, we have no choice, she did it, and we have to prosecute. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">So I wrote up a defense and there was a trial, so this was public. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">The other thing that surely made clear to people that I was Jewish was the fact that I found out that there was a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="952">And so they showed me where it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">It was dirty and had been used as a <span class="INT_SPACE">storeroom</span> , but it hadn’t been burned in Kristallnacht because it was a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in a whole row of <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , undistinguished, and if you had tried to burn it, you would have burned others — places down. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">So I decided it needed to be restored, and went to the German — th-the — well, I think the mayor actually came to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> when I asked for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">I told him August 1, 2010 this — we had to clean up the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and I ask him also that this be done by people who had damaged it, if their names could be identified. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">And he was not a Nazi, he had been put in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="957">So he was able apparently, to find out who did it, and so the members of the family, who had been in the SS or SA and had damaged the interior of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , had to come with brooms and paintbrushes and clean up the <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="958">QUESTION:  Did you cover this in your newspaper?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="959">ANSWER:  And that I put in the newspaper as a story, and again it was published all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And the — the interesting part was that one of the rabbis I just met now, in — I th —I think it was the rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremburg</span> , actually had been — there is a Jewish community now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> , and it is operating. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">It’s not very large, but the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> is being used. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">So these kinds of things, I could do, simply because I had the authority to select what things to write about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="963">QUESTION:  Now I understand that you were also doing some things in a different capacity —
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="964">QUESTION:  — that you were working together with the Bricha.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="965">ANSWER:  Now, because my brother was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Brigade</span> , and knew my address, and knew my telephone number, and he could tell people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Brigade</span> , who were being released temporarily by the brigade, to organize the rescue of Jews in August 1, 2010 <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="966">The brigade just had enough autonomy to arrange their — the mission — the execution of the missions that they had, mostly transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">They had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to move from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , and they did a lot of transporting. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">So what they did is they organized their crews so that about two-thirds did the work and one-third were released to — given ex-extended leave to go into <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> to either visit the s — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where they came from, and to help Jews to organize, in order to get to the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> , because th-there was no future for Jews in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And in order to increase the number of Jews who wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , you had to first bring them to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And so there were agents of the Jewish Brigade, whose job it was to go into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> is close to the <span class="DLF">Czech border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="971">So they had my name and telephone number so they could call me from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and say they needed my advice, could I see them? </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And I wo — of course always would say yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">And this way I became well-known, apparently, on this group of underground workers, and they would come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> and they needed a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep at night, which I could provide, and food. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">And then I would get them to the <span class="DLF">Czech border</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="975">QUESTION:  Did anybody notice that you had these guests coming, mysterious guests, or were you able to keep it a secret? </span><span class="sentence" id="976">August 1, 2010
ANSWER:  Nobody paid much attention to what I was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">That — the Germans didn’t pay — you know, I had no one check on what I was doing and it was perfectly legitimate for the editor of the newspaper to interview anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">So, it was reasonable for me to interview visiting dignitaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">The fact that they ca — happened to come from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> — my commanding officer wasn’t interest — I mean, the — he was not my commanding officer, because he had no authority over the newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">He — he was responsible for making sure my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> was operating properly and that I had the necessary fuel and food. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">He wasn’t at [indecipherable] the newspaper was not his job, so he didn’t intervene at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">I’m not sure he even looked at — at the paper I put out. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">He had a German girlfriend, and had a wonderful time, you know, had nothing to do, so I don’t think he ever once ever asked me about my work, because my command was not — he was not — I was not under his command. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">My commanding officer was, by that time, Major Hans Harber(ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Nauheim</span> , or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , where supreme <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> were located. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">That was my command.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="986">QUESTION:  And how long did you remain in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="987">ANSWER:  Well, my job ended when the newspaper was turned over back to a German editorial board, about November ’45. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">By that time, nearly all the newspapers, maybe with a week or two difference, were turned over to the Germans, and the program of U.S. operated German newspapers came to an end. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">And I had August 1, 2010 accumulated enough points to be sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="990">But because of the fact that there was a army program that permitted soldiers in Europe to visit relatives if they were available, I decided to take advantage of that, and I went, I think to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Nauheim</span> , and asked to meet with my brother in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="991">And that was approved, but a few hours later, while waiting around, I was told sorry, Sergeant Eaton, <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> is closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">The British have closed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Litwinski</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , a <span class="DLF">recreational facility</span> for American sailors and soldiers, and ask all Americans to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">There’s no way for you to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> because there were several generals who wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> for Christmas, but who were refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">So I f— thought quickly, and said, but could I meet my brother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="995">If you can get transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">So I gave them the address of a school friend at <span class="BUILDING">Cornell University</span> , a Jew from <span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span> , who had moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> , and I knew his address because he had sent me an invitation to his wedding in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="997">So I got permission to go [indecipherable] I wanted to see my brother, and so they approved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">And when the orders were printed, they were printed like all other orders, to carry out the instructions of the commander, without specifying anything except I was put on detached duty for two weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> to carry out instructions of the theater commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">That was Eisenhower. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">So, my commanding officer, who knew why I was leaving, what I went doing, said that’s wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">I don’t care how long you August 1, 2010 stay, because when you g-go back, you going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">We don’t need you any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">So again, I’m not sure every commanding officer would have taken that position. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">So, I had to find my way to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">Well, there was no — I didn’t get orders, transportation orders, because there was no way to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">So I packed up a duffel bag and hitchhiked to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , because I knew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> we had an <span class="BUILDING">air force base</span> , and I had found out that we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> flying from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> to the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">So when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , I found out that there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> , but there were a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> going to <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> , and they had to stop off in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span> to refuel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">So, showing my orders, I got orders to fly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span> and then I would find a way of going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">Nobody told me how I would do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span> , and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span> a British officer looking at my orders said, you are very lucky Sergeant Eaton, we have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> in an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">But I didn’t want to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> , I want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">So I said, well I can’t go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> now, I have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span> first. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">He said, it doesn’t say in your orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">I said, I have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span> first. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">And, I can’t let you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span> , it’s does — not in your orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">So I said, would you put in writing that you’re refusing to let me go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">He didn’t want to do that, so instead, he accepted my request and he issued a voucher for me to go to the best <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span> , where the British August 1, 2010 officers were staying, to get a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> at British expense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">And I said I would find a way of getting to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">And I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">I got ahold of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , there were bus service every few days from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Damascus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Damascus</span> I got a ba — a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ruspina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">And then I spent three and a half weeks in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , in American uniform, knowing that under British rules, I’m not supposed to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">No one ever stopped me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1024">QUESTION:  Just stop you one second.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1025">ANSWER:  And the French really were willing to be part of a new Europe, but it was the Jews who prevented this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">So that as a — an — and this was also in ’45 already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">In ’46 the British felt they could not change the policy in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and therefore actually you had a rebellion of Jews against the British. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">And the whole uncertainty of what would happen to all these displaced persons, the ba — of course, after my newspaper was over, and I no longer had a position, I — I was offered a job in military government in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> by the U.S. Army, with a pro — with a promotion to captain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">But I didn’t want to live among Germans, and I wanted to finish my academic career, so — and I didn’t really like the American policy in general, which was to work very closely with the lower level German officials, which I didn’t particularly like, although today I realize that if we had done what we did in <span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span> , of dismissing the infrastructure of Saddam Hussein, we really didn’t have the August 1, 2010 means to govern the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">And so we really didn’t have much of a choice, except to use a great many officials in the same positions that they had occupied under the Nazis, as long as they had not been excessively active, and known to have been — have — have en-engaged in atrocities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">So major anti-Semites, judges who convicted too many people to death for stealing food, or for racial fo — fo — disapproved sexual relations or things like that, they lost their job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">But most judges, most Nazi judges stayed as Nazi judges. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">And so by the time I could have become maybe the governor of this or that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I would have had to deal with these kinds of officials, so no, I wanted to finish my PhD. So that — the — but certainly the — one other thing is, once I started to go back 1 — go into teaching, my focus was on my professional career. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">So I had research ideas, and I got adequate funding for research. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">So I focused on research, I didn’t return to my army days or take a look at my extensive files of what happened in World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">I didn’t think of myself of somebody who was a historian of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">I had lots of interesting records of things I did, and they were put in boxes, and these boxes got transported from this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I was always too busy to really look at them, of what was in there, because I had many other interesting professional challenges, until after my retirement, I started looking at the material. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">And I’m now engaged in writing a history of how my family interacted with the German culture over many August 1, 2010 centuries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Because one has to face the fact that historically, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was never just a country of Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">There was always an existing minority that had a very important function, namely the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1041">QUESTION:  And when you look at all the documents that you accumulated when you were in the army, you’re looking at them fresh after so many years, 1s there anything that surprises you, that you view differently in retrospect than you did at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1042">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">The —I mean, for hundreds of years, on both sides of my family, they remained Orthodox, even though a large proportion of the German Jews became Reform Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">On my father’s side they were quite conservative. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">On my mother’s side, they took advantage of modern secular education, but they remained Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">I had relatives as far back as 1835 who went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , because they wanted to live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">I— on my mother’s side, I had people going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , 1882. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">The — so that my family was clearly Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">Two of my brothers remained Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">My oldest brother and I, especially under the influence of the Holocaust, I became convinced there is no superior po-power looking after exactly what’s happening to any of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">And that if there is some rational power that explains the incredible complexity, and the — the uniformity of many things in nature; the fact that we have DNA that we shor — share with earthworms and with butterflies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">There’s s-some incredible rationality that somehow has developed an evolution for August 1, 2010 which I have no explanation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">But I don’t think there 1s a god who decides that I’ve been a good person, or I have had significant faults, on the basis of which my afterlife would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">So, I— I am not an Orthodox Jew today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">And — but I am identified with the Jewish community for ethnic reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">So from that point of view, I had an opportunity to do things during those unusual periods of time, which the only other time I was able to express my interest in being Jewish is when I took a job for five years to establish a school of social work in <span class="BUILDING">Haifa University</span> , and they needed an outside person who was not involved in Israeli politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">And so they brought me in because <span class="BUILDING">university</span> wanted to establish a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that would compete with <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span> and have a different ideology, so I took that job.</span></p>
