<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER:  My name is Arnold Einhorn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , on May 1, 1923. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My parents were not native of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> ; my father was of Polish nationality, my mother, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">One was Russian-Polish and the other one was what they call a "Galicianer," from <span class="REGION">Galicia</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">But both of them came to--respectively one, my father, to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , when he was a young teenager and my mother as a young child, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , before WWI. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">During WWI, my mother was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and my father was in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and then they married in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and--where they had their first child. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And we were a family of five children. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My father at first had a <span class="BUILDING">delicatessen</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">kosher delicatessen</span> , and he also had a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">seaside</span> , but the delicatessen failed, sort of, after a certain time, with the depression; and then he continued his <span class="BUILDING">seaside hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">He was a very Orthodox man, but not a bearded--he was a westernized Orthodox Jew, very traditionally Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="9"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> had a--the entire population of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , as far as Jews are concerned, is about 50 to 60--50,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Then when the refugees came, after '33 to '39, I think, they went up to 60,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">The majority of the Jews lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">They were a very separate community from the rest, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">They had been lured by King Albert I, from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> mostly, in order to start the diamond business. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">However, it became very difficult, even if you were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , to become Belgian. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">There was a certain discrimination, as far as naturalization is concerned, against the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And even when you were born there, you had to opt for the Belgian nationality actively. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">It was expensive, and it was very fastidious; it took time. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I know that just before the war, when I was 16, I started opting and by the time the WWII started, I still hadn't gotten my nationality. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And then <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> gave up the Jews and we all became stateless, even though I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and considered us Belgian. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I was bilingual and I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I went to <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> there--I mean <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> , not <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">In general, the government was not antisemitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="23"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> in particular had a Socialist mayor, Camille Huysmans, who was quite supportive of the Jews, but by '36, a very strong Fascist movement--two actually--one was the Flemish Fascist movement by Staf de Clercq,' who was virulent anti-Semitic; and the Rexist” movement of Degrelle,? </span><span class="sentence" id="24">who ' Founder of National Flemish League (VNV) on October 1, 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">S.J. Woolf, ed., </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Fascism in Europe (London: Methuen and Co., 1981), 290-1. * </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Like the VNV, the Rexist movement was subtly fascist in its later stages although, officially, it called itself an authoritarian government. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Rexism reached its peak between 1935-6. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Fascism in Europe, 284-285. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">> Léon Degrelle was the leader of the Rexist movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Fascism in subsequently furnished soldiers to Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Degrelle and Staf de Clercq were virulently anti--they went into--I had been once--no--more than once, beaten up on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> because they would occasionally raid. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Groups of uniformed Fascists would come in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span> and just beat up the Jewish boys and older people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  What year was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  It was 1n '38 to '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I remember being--just coming in, and then suddenly they would, they would attack bearded Jews in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and then if they saw somebody that they thought lived in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , they would just beat them up, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">That's about all, but there were a number of Zionist movements and even Revisionist* movements, so that the Jews had quite a free life there. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">The government had no discrimination, officially. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Of course, if you wanted to have certain jobs, then there were discriminations, so, in general, I would say <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> had a certain enlightened attitude towards the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We were not affected, other than by having those 10,000 refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , by what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> until May the 10th. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">When we woke up and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> was bombed by the Germans and we discovered we were at war, we were invaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">It was very fast and the 13th or 14th of May they had already reached almost the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44"><span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> is very small and as you know, the king capitulated within a week, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Because we had a small <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> right at the sea shore, my father took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> and just left everything in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and reached that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but we stayed only there for one day, because we heard that the Germans had already occupied, were already reaching the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , and so we followed the flow of those thousands of refugees that clogged the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and occasionally were attacked by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , you know, just came down, swooping down and machine-gunned the refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And I had a small-- my brother is 15 years younger, so I had him. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">He had whooping cough and I was just carrying him on my back and he was just having his spells on my back and vomiting on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">It was a terrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> because we used to be on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and then hide, jumping off the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and just going by foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">The French at first hadn't opened the, hadn't opened the <span class="DLF">border</span> , so we were camping there for I think two days without having food or anything and then suddenly they opened the <span class="DLF">border</span> and we could come down to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Somehow I thought that--because everybody was going towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arras</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">northern cities</span> near the <span class="DLF">border</span> because they hoped that they would get to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">We--my father--found some kind of a private <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and they brought us down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And we found later on that most of those refugees who tried to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arras</span> were bombed at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">He managed to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and we stayed there for one night when my father again heard that we had to register as refugees, especially if we weren't Belgian, and so he went to the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">There he--that's when he had--at first he was a very great admirer of the French, he thought they were--the French revolution was really the representatives of what a republic should Europe, 284. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">+ «movement of maximist political Zionists founded and led by Vladimir Jabotinsky.” </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem: Keter Publishing, 1971), s.v. “</span><span class="sentence" id="57">revisionist.” </span><span class="sentence" id="58">mean--and a freedom-loving republic. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And that's when he had--the first time, he asked, and he said that we would like to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> if we could, and the man said, “You dirty Jew,” and hit him and said, “You better report tomorrow to the--” what they call the caserne de tourelles,° which is a <span class="BUILDING">military barracks</span> , where then we found that all the refugees were being channeled towards various parts of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">The second time that we realized how antisemitic actually police was, was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">There were many refugees from all over, most Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was then a Fascist country and was just going into, was then entering the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">There was an Italian worker who was totally uneducated. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">The police was assigning to each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , you know, a person 1n charge, and I say my father was the most educated person in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and he was a really respectable-looking man, but they took the Italian worker who was drunk and uneducated and put him in charge because, he said it openly, “I'm not going to put any Jew in charge of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So that was the thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  How long were you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  Only 48 hours I think--72 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Because we--they-- didn't want to have Jewish refugees in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and so they evacuated and we went with other Belgian non-Jews into-- we ended up after a long ordeal on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> in <span class="REGION">central France</span> , in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ardéche</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">It's a small state, a small <span class="BUILDING">department</span> , which the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">capital</span> had about 4,000 inhabitants and we ended up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hamlet</span> where we stayed for three months over the summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">It was a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , I became a farm boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">As a matter of fact, I keep in touch with the farmer I met. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I have been several times to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hamlet</span> 50 years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">He's still alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  How did you connect with the farmer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  Oh, they put us up in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">They put us up in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that was--that only worked during the winter because they didn't have electricity and in the winter there was enough water to get the--to farm the--it was a silk, they were doing, something was just silk thread or something--and we were <span class="BUILDING">barracked</span> there, at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And within a few--when in June we came there in May, the end of May. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">On June 18th, I think, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> capitulated and Pétain® took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">The Belgian refugees who were non-Jewish were repatriated. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">There was also another Jewish family who also was--chose to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">The reason why is because rumor spreads very quickly that there were camps all over <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , especially near the Pyrénées, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Cyprien</span> , Anjouleme, Corse, where the conditions were extremely difficult, and they said they were very harsh towards the Jews in particular, and so we heard about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And as a matter of fact, we heard that the oldest sister of my mother, her husband, her daughter, and her grandchild were there, and there were conditions so bad that they also chose to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And when > <span class="DLF">Barracks turret</span> (French). </span><span class="sentence" id="84">° Pétain, Henri (1856-1951); French marshal who corroborated with the Nazis and lead the French Vichy government during W.W.II. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Bruce Wetterau, World History (New York: Henry Holt Publishing, 1994), 838. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">another Jewish family in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Julien</span> du Corse, population including I think the animals, was 600 people; but it was spread over miles and miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">It's a hamlet. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">We chose to stay there, until the winter came, in which we then moved to the capital, which is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brive</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And there we--suddenly on November, I think in November, were told that we had to report to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agde</span> , the next morning, just to take the bare essentials, leave everything else and leave and go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agde</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And that's in November '40. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">We then reported to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">That was a real <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  Okay, before--I want you to tell me about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agde</span> , but when you were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , where you were working as a farm boy? </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Was there any poor treatment of you or your family because you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  No, no, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">They didn't even know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I mean, they were very simple people and also, the inhabitants of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ardéche</span> in particular, it's the only province. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">It used to be a province of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , where the Huguenots used to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">There are still <span class="INT_SPACE">caves</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">They had a long history of religious oppression, so they had a tradition--there is a very strange population who understands oppression and that's why when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brive</span> --actually the assistant mayor, his wife was a music teacher--the assistant mayor was also I think a principal in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Both of them were very flattered to have city people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , and especially we were very good in Latin and Greek, all of us, the three children were so religious in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and my youngest sister was a musician, she was one of those--she had given in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> a concert--the teacher four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">She was Wunderkind,’ I mean she was good, so they were very flattered to have these people, and they didn't make any discriminatory at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They were very nice people and the farmers, they were just interested 1n us. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I must tell you, incidentally, that 40 years later I came to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and went to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and there I found my co-farm boy, who had become in the meantime the owner of the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and the first thing that I came in--the woman came in and says, “Who are you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="105">and I said, “I was a refugee here 40 years ago,” she said, “Are you Arthur or David?” </span><span class="sentence" id="106">David was the other boy, and Arthur is my real name, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And she said, “You know, we recently watched a program on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , and we were wondering whether you were still alive, or you had been...” So, they really were nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And I keep in touch with my farmer friend ever since. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">As a matter of fact, I was there six months ago. ’ </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Child prodigy (German).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  So you went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agde</span> , what--
ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agde</span> , that was the first big tragedy because we had to leave again. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Whatever little we had saved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , which was very little, it's what we could take with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Under what circumstances that--did you get rounded up? </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I mean what--
ANSWER:  No, there was a notification from the police, ” You have to report tomorrow morning to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="115">We were the only, I think, Jewish family there. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">There was a Luxembourg family, a Jewish family from <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> who--I'm sorry, who was, who did not get called. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We got called and I think because we were not Belgian nationals--there, you see, that thing, that stateless Jewish status. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We then had to report to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agde</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and there a lot of people came from all over the various <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It was a terrible shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Agde was exactly how we had seen pictures of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> or something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">It's barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">There had been people concentrated there for several months, including Czech refugees, you know, who had served in the army actually, and if they were Jewish, they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Also it had been for a long time a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> for the Spanish civil war fighters, you know, who <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> had gradually betrayed--the first to come over and then Blum® actually had made some deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Those were exactly like the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that you can see from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">These were platform--there were two tier platforms of wood, without-- with--some straw which had remained from--it's full of lice and fleas. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">They gave each of them an old blanket--each of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">There was one--women were sent, women and children were separated in a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they had a little bit of a better <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because they had some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> in there, we didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">It was very cold, it was windswept, it was a miserable <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">There was one faucet <span class="NPIP">outside</span> for--I think there were 14,000 people in there at one point--and then it froze. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">There was no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We used to get one soup and a rather mildewed bread every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And then in the evening we used to get some other--if the thing wasn't frozen, if the faucet wasn't frozen--we had some cooking. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">It was a miserable <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I remember we were freezing, we were mis--we were eaten by fleas and lice, and one or two of the people became actually crazy in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">There was no <span class="BUILDING">dispensary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">The only places people were aiming 1s to try to get the job at the commandant’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because that was a warm <span class="NPIP">place</span> and my sisters, one of my older sisters, because she was, she was I think trilingual, and she was taking shorthand or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">She worked for the commandant of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp--</span> commandant and also another family from I think elsewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Levine and these are the two families that were actually later on liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">About three months after we were there, my sister obtained from one the--yes, that was when de Lattre de Tassigny(ph), * Blum, Léon (1872-1950); “first Jew and first socialist to become premier of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Encyclopaedia Judaica (<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> : Keter Publishing, 1971), s.v. “</span><span class="sentence" id="141">Blum, Léon.” </span><span class="sentence" id="142">who was the préfet?--préfet is like the governor, but it was an appointed préfet--and he--I don't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Yeah, he was the "Préfet de Police" and he came and visited that camp and because there was some former Czech foreign legion of people, he got very indignant about the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">He says, “I want that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> disbanded, I don't want it in my <span class="REGION">province</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Instead of liberating the people, he just sent them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Now, what did you do all day in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> if you were there for months?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  There wasn't work, or--
ANSWER:  Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">We just hung around freezing and waiting for food to be given and trying to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Well, as a matter of fact, one of my cousins, his name is Michael Brushkin, he was married to a cousin of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">He lived in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theonville</span> , and he served with the French army. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And I know that he was very, very outgoing and also he had a big--he had a <span class="BUILDING">shoe factory</span> , I think, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theonville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And somehow it happened to move a lot of shoes or something, and he bribed people with shoes because we didn't have anything, and he came to visit us in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> showing his military paper and acting as, "I'm an officer of the French army.” </span><span class="sentence" id="154">They let him in and he actually smuggled my youngest sister out on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">He came with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and just walked off with her on the back of his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">He then managed, when my sister got a pass of one day, after the de Lattre de Tassigny visit--the camp commander was a little shook up by the criticism he had so he gave her and also this other girl, Miss Levine, I think was her name--they got a pass and my cousin somehow must have known that there was a gentleman in the Montpellier prefecture by the name of Ernst I think was his name, he was a Alsatian, who was one of the early resistance people. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">He managed to fix some things and said, “If you can prove that they can live--survive--I can manage to get them out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> before it moves to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> , but they'll have to live in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> where all the parolees and people who were on parole or former convicts who had no right to live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And we were given--we were allowed to rent--a little <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> there in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And we lived with these people were very nice and they had an advantage since they knew all the police and always warned us if there was something stirring if people were trying to get after us, and they sort of protected us. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">There's no antisemitism there, amongst the parolees. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">They were liberated in the--we were in during November, I think, by January or February, '41, no--yeah--'41. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">We were then liberated from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> after three months in there and allowed to live there, and again I went to work in vineyards, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I also registered in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> actually, but I didn't show up too much there because in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there was a lot of antisemitism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  This is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> ? ? </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Prefect (French).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I wanted to get my degree, my baccalaureate, my, you know, secondary education, so when I was working the <span class="DLF">farms</span> , occasionally I showed up in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I was registered officially, but I didn't like it because there was a lot of antisemitism there. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Every time, for example, the name of a Jew came up--Bergson,'° for example, a philosopher we used to read--everybody was saying, “Jew, Jew, Jew,” you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And so, I didn't make--first of all I couldn't be there too much; it was six kilometers, or no, it was about 15 kilometers of where we lived so it was hard for me to get there and besides, the food shortage was terrible in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> had only vineyards at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Jews also were sort of in <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">We had special--we had identification cards stamped “Juif,’!! </span><span class="sentence" id="173">and we also had ration cards stamped “Juif,” so it was difficult sometimes to get rations, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">That was the only thing we felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">On the other hand, individual people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> were just marvelous. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">For example, my father, he had some, he had quite a bit of, had acquired in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> some skills in jewelry, old jewelry or something, and in old books, because you don't always interest an old book and he got to know an antiquity dealer by the name of Leyvastre. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I mention him because he really saved our lives two or three times and he just told him, “Whenever I buy something that you advise me, I'll make sure that you get some percentage,” so that he helped us to live, on the one hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">On the other hand, every time there was some stirring up, where we heard that men for example were being drafted or Jews were--then he said, “Well, come and live with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I'll--you'll--live with us for a couple of weeks,” you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">He always had an excuse. “</span><span class="sentence" id="181">Your son is very smart in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ; he can tutor my daughter, who's very shy, in Latin, and who flunked once the oral exams.” </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And I tutored her a little bit and later on he acted as if I had done a great deal to his family, when he had saved our life by hiding us. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">We found out later that that daughter, that child daughter that I tutored, was one of the heroes of the French underground, and we didn't even know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I mean, she was so shy and withdrawn, but her name was Jeanne Leyvastre. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">She married later her chief of the underground and had five children, moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I found this out later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  Were there many Jews in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier suburb</span> that you were staying in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  There were no--I think we were the--yes--there was one other family, unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">There was an Austrian couple, those were the only ones, an Austrian couple who was hidden in the--not just a block away from where we lived, because that was the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , that was--now there are a lot of in that <span class="REGION">area</span> that has been developed into an <span class="REGION">area</span> where many of the Algerian refugees, many North African refugees, after it became independent, have settled in this very developed--and the vineyards have disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I went there on one occasion, to visit it, and when we left there it was one of those desert, what they call the garrigue’*, which is a very windswept area with--it is very ' Bergson, Henri Louis (1859-1941), French philosopher. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem: Keter Publishing, 1971), s.v. “</span><span class="sentence" id="192">Bergson.” '</span><span class="sentence" id="193">l Jew (French). '</span><span class="sentence" id="194">2 Stony, sun drenched <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> (French). </span><span class="sentence" id="195">hot and it just has very low bushes. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">It's sort of a mosquito-infested; stone--it's a little bit like <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> sometimes, you know where--before it was settled. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And so that's where they had these little <span class="BUILDING">shacks</span> with people living there who had been in the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> or had been something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  Did everyone know you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">As a matter of fact, I had a neighbor who was, just, who sold me a terrible <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , but he was a real ex-convict, but he always gave us hints of what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">He said, “Watch out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I don't know where he knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">No, they were nice and there was another girl up in another--Nadalié--we used to come over and says, “You come and listen to...,” he used to be gassed in WWI, “...come and listen to the radio from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , from the BBC” because we didn't have a radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">We were not allowed to have a radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">We didn't have anything in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> except a little old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> and five bedsprings, and that's all we had in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and our water came from--was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cistern</span> ; it collected rain and when it didn't rain after November or something, I used to have to go every day and five miles with a wheel barrel that, again, my friend the convict Monsieur Durand had sold me, to get water.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  Was there presence of the Vichy” police?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, there was. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">The Vichy, they were very, very active, that's what I'm trying to--the mayor, the mayor was a fellow by the name of Sudrier, who was a Vichy. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">He was, he was the one who was responsible frequently of telling the suppliers, the butcher, etcetera, not to give us, but to put as at the end of any <span class="DLF">line</span> that we come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">He was always checking on us and unfortunately the person where the Austrian lived, they were Jehovah’s Witnesses and acted very officiously, but the man was working in the, in the, also in the <span class="BUILDING">mayors office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">He also was a former veteran of WWI, and they, I think, sold out again those refugees who were within the Austrian refugees because they were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and they never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">But that's all and then we lived there as best we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I used to work in vineyards and go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> occasionally and then--
QUESTION:  Did you have a sense of fear or anticipation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">ANSWER:  Terrible, oh, all the time, because the rumors were going and the <span class="BUILDING">rumor mill</span> was going all the time, and for one year we were not bothered until the early part of July of '42, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">We finally got there in '41. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Even after the Americans got into the war, we were always trying to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> to try and get visas to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> because we have a 'S Town in <span class="REGION">central France</span> which gave its name to French government after <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was defeated by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Pétain was head of state. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Vichy did not govern <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> since the end of 1942, when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> occupied the southern French “free zone.” </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Elizabeth-Anne Wheal, Stephen Pope, James Taylor, A Dictionary of the Second World War (New York: Peter Bedrick Books, 1990), 500. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">large family in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , but we found out later why, you know, when we saw the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> , the Friar(ph) thing that the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> had the orders to stall the Jews and not to get them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I don't know if you saw those papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">We realized it. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And so we lived in tremendous fear, especially after the Americans got into war in December '41 and then by July '42, then really we felt, we knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and I think the rumor had started that Jews are going to be shipped to sort of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> and some of them may have been <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">They didn't know that there was active extermination, but we heard about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and I think <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">We knew about these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and we knew that people were starved there. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">We didn't know about the extermination, which had started then. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">That we didn't know, but we--
QUESTION:  How did you get the information about this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">ANSWER:  I don't know, the rumor mills were just incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And everybody always--we used to have these code words like, we had a--we knew that, one or two things we knew is--one of my, as I mentioned to you, the oldest sister of my mother and her husband, their girl--daughter and their granddaughter had been near the Pyrénées in a camp and they were repatriated. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">We also knew that another sister of my mother, who also never came, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and was--never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">The third had been sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">That's all we knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">QUESTION:  How did you know this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  Because the daughter, because the daughter of the oldest sister of my mother, she managed to get--to smuggle out with her daughter, to get from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> to the <span class="REGION">occupied area</span> and from the <span class="REGION">occupied area</span> to the non-occupied and because of that cousin of mine, Michael, who was in the army, everybody knew, had followed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Because they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theonville</span> and then they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nevers</span> and then they knew that they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> and she showed up one day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> --she had smuggled out. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And then she told us that her parents had been told to report to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moulins</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">That's the way it was and they disappeared and the same thing the other sister, that she disappeared and then the brother of my mother, the younger brother of my mother also was reported to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moulins</span> and we knew that the son of one of my--had also reported, and then one of the other sons, who is still now in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , he jumped off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> --from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> --and came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and told that woman, that daughter, and then she subsequently was deported from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So that's how we knew what happened to our family in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , and we all knew that they were sent from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moulins</span> to various <span class="NPIP">places</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , so that's how we--but also the, there were some people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> that my father was in touch with, Jews, and not the French. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">The French Jews kept apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">They thought they were not going to be touched; it was only the foreign Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">But the foreign community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> knew about it and the rumor mill went and you see when we had my cousin Hela, the one that came from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , and she told us about all these people who had been deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">They always said they had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moulins</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moulins</span> they were sent away and we also knew about that boy, my cousin, who was my age, just a little younger, that he had been--he jumped from a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> when he was, and he came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , where he hid. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">We had another cousin who's husband--who had just been married just before the war--who's husband had been again sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , so we knew about those things, but we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I mean, we all had this picture of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , which we knew from before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">The horrible things happened, the people starved to death, you know and they're worked, and also two of my cousins had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> and again the one that jumped from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> told us about it, so we knew about it, but I can't precisely know how it happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And then we saw <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agde</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agde</span> was a horrible camp and we knew also that the majority of the people who had been sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> had been deported to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Again, the rumor mill knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">It's funny thing i1s--because I didn't hear from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> after that and then I had a book here about the camps in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and they say the result is the major source of deportees of the <span class="REGION">zone</span> libre’*--non-occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">All right? </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And we go on and then when we got in in July of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">My father and I were again summoned to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agde</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agde</span> , to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> not the rest of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I--but when I got the summons, I also had heard about--I was being, I was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I had already registered with the mandatory rule group from-- as students. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I was registered in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Actually I had, I successfully got my baccalaureate from there, which was a miracle, and so I had actually applied even to pre-medical school, was refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I had that certificate that I was turned away because of--I didn't meet the quota of Israelites. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And so I'd registered with all the students for mandatory work in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I was working at that time near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> , in a big <span class="DLF">communal garden</span> , together with Indo-Chinese. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">It was the Indo-Chinese former soldiers that they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">It was called the camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nam Phong</span> for some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Nam Phong: the five--I think <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nam Phong</span> means “the five <span class="REGION">provinces</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And I was there, working there, and fortunately I had registered with that so that I went to--when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agde</span> , I also managed to get some kind of a certificate from my father--a medical certificate that he was ill, so when they couldn't get me, the young guy, because I was, I was, they couldn't supersede the ruler, the government's rule of service. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">They let me go, so I didn't go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agde</span> , I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agde</span> the second time, but they let me go and since they couldn't get me. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">They let my father go, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agde</span> then had just been a sort of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">holding camp</span> to send to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> out again. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And so I went back and I went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> with my group. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Did a stupid thing because I went without the pass, and when I was there working in the <span class="DLF">farm</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , all the French boys gradually gave up because it was too tough, but I stayed there, so the farmer liked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And I continued and then I got the letter from my family that they were in hiding because they had heard about--no-- they've come to be notified that we have to report and that's when the father said he wasn't going and he hid on the other side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">They all went to one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> claiming that it was a woman who was renting out <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> for people who had patients in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">It was near a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Eloi</span> , and so they were hiding there, and I got a letter in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> that they were hiding because they were living there near the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> because they were going to send them to where they send my Aunt Dora, which was the one that was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And so I came back, stupidly, because I came without the--I didn't have a pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I had to have a--I wasn't with my group any more and I needed to have a pass, but I managed to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> where I noticed that '4 Free zone (French). </span><span class="sentence" id="273">there was a group of the black-shirted militia checking everybody on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and I had no pass, but there was a strange thing that the farmer had given me a chicken, a scrawny chicken, and you know, we didn't have food and I was bringing a chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">There was a law at that time; <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> had still internal customs called an octroi!</span><span class="sentence" id="275">>, and suddenly I said, “Well, I have to get that chicken through the octroi,” and so I went to another <span class="DLF">exit</span> where there was no black guards and that's how I got out of the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I didn't realize at that time that that chicken saved my life and as I came out, I noticed a friend of mine, by the name of Jack--Jean-- Ginsburg from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and I said, “Do you know, by any chance, where my family is?” </span><span class="sentence" id="277">He says, “Yes, I know, because I helped them move.” </span><span class="sentence" id="278">He was sort of--at that time he was dating my sister so he knew and he was a boy that I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , Jean Ginsburg. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And so he showed me where my family was and that's when I had this big idea, I said, “Oh, we can't be crowded like that,’ my parents said, “But you know there are seals on our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we can't go back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I said, “Well, I know--I have, I know where the key is of one of the <span class="DLF">farms</span> where I lived, I worked, and why don't we take my two sisters and myself?” </span><span class="sentence" id="281">and we walked to the other side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , about eight kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I took my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and we walked and so I crossed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , crossed the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and ended up--but I forgot to tell--there's a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> again, the octro1, the internal customs and there was a militia man standing there and stopping us and saying, “I have orders to round up all the foreign people,” and asked us, “Are you Jewish?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="283">Yes.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="284">So I have to round you up.” </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I have no--I think the Belgian people don't have to be--and I had only a--my ID was an ID from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ; it says I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">It didn't say any nationality, but I had an older sister who was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and he didn't know the rules, so he took us in and we found out that that was the big round-up of Jews, French and foreign, that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">That was the 26th of August, 1942, where the majority of the Jews of the <span class="REGION">free zone</span> had been rounded up by the French and all deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And we came there and we found the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> was full of people and he came, it was after midnight, he says, “Oh, I've got one more of them,” and that's when the person asked me, “Where...’’-- the policeman-- “Where do they live?” </span><span class="sentence" id="289">He says “That's why I caught them. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I checked. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">They lived where they were caught, at the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> ,” and he said he would be willing to go to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and check and I said, “Don't,” because I knew that the seals were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">He took us there and that's when we had this man sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">There was a commission sitting there, three people. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">One obviously was a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">I don't--the reason why I think he was German is because he used a strange word for our ID items. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">The French used the word “ coordonnée!</span><span class="sentence" id="297">®,” the Germans used the word "Personalien.”!” </span><span class="sentence" id="298">and he used the word "Personalien,” you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">He says, “Take that person out and let him go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And he asked me, “What is your confession?” </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I said, “What's a confession?” </span><span class="sentence" id="302">He says, “Your religion.” </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I had a moment of hesitation and I said, “Jewish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="304">He had a moment of hesitation, he says, “Well, since they live there, we know where to get them. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Why don't you let them go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So we went, fortunately not directly <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we went back to that <span class="DLF">farm</span> where I had the key to--slept there, which was about four kilometers 'S <span class="BUILDING">Toll-house</span> (French).

'” </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Particulars (German). </span><span class="sentence" id="309">from where I lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And in the morning I decided, since they had let us go, we probably are not looked for, and that's where I met our, my friend the convict, the ex-convict, he says, “Are you crazy? </span><span class="sentence" id="311">What are you doing here?” </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I said, “Well, we coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because they caught us last night and they let us go,” He says, “I have news for you, they must have made a mistake, because they used to have three policemen watching your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , today they have six.” </span><span class="sentence" id="313">So we didn't go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we kept being hidden for about two or three months until things calmed down. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">That happens all the time in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">They make an action and then they forget about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And after two or three months hiding we went--by that time it was I think September--no--it was October. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">You remember that man, that man in the prefecture by the name of Ernst, and he arranged again to get us a complete absolution and we can go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">The seals have to be removed, we are no longer looked for, and then we lived there for another month until the Americans disembarked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">That's November '42 and suddenly, the entire occupied--the entire non-occupied became occupied, that's in November, '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Am I rambling too much?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">QUESTION:  No, not at all, no, but I just have a few questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">ANSWER:  Good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">QUESTION:  This is great. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Explain the seals on the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I don't think that everyone knows about this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">ANSWER:  Oh, the French commandeered--the priest came in, that guy Sudrier, who was the mayor, you know the guy with the militia man--he came down with the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I wasn't there, but my parents said they ran away and then one of my sisters, you know-- remember I may be what they call a Jewish stereotype now, looking Jewishy, but at the time I was blonde. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I had a lot of blonde hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I'm blue eyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">In the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , I looked more southern French than any of the--the French in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> looked more Jewish than I looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">So my sister--one sister's very blonde and blue-eyed, and she was not the Jewish stereotype the way they saw it, you know, they didn't take us as a Jewish stereotype. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">With age I became more Jewishy looking, but then I wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And so one of my sisters went and she found that there were big locks, seals. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">You see, we had a little <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> there, it was sort of a, a little <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> --just one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and then a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> upstairs, and then there was a little <span class="DLF">garden</span> and a <span class="DLF">gate</span> , a little <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">That <span class="DLF">gate</span> , they had put the seals on--wax seals--just like you put in a criminal thing, you seal the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , so that you can't--1f you open the <span class="DLF">door</span> , you break the seals. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">It's the same as they do for example if there's a murder case in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> for example, they will put the seal on the <span class="DLF">doors</span> so that you can't open it. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And actually that night, after we were caught, when I walked back because I said, “I'm going to come back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ,” and that Durand, I hadn't met Durand yet, but I had run into Sudrier, the mayor and he says, “Where have you been?” </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And I said, “Oh, we were told that maybe they're going to deport us and so he says, “You see this 1s all British propaganda,” I said, “I know because I was at the policier'® last and they freed us,” he says, “You see?” </span><span class="sentence" id="339">But then that's when he probably called the police and they doubled the thing and that's when Durand, the neighbor, the ex-convict told us about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">That's the seals, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And for two months nobody could enter that little <span class="DLF">gate</span> we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I have actually pictures of that little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  So you had to stay put?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">ANSWER:  Yeah, we hid--I kept up--because they were torturing--the reason why I could stay at this <span class="BUILDING">gardener’s home</span> 1s that poor guy was actually a Cypriot. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">His name was Pascalis and he had been into--they decided a Cypriot is a British citizen, so they send him--the poor--the Pascalis, he was such an innocuous man, he was just a gardener who could hardly read. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And so they send him as a British subject to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and interned him as an enemy alien, so his little <span class="DLF">garden</span> --he had built a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there, it was just a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> --and he's even dug his own <span class="DLF">well</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And so since he was deported, his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">But I knew where the key was and nobody ever bothered us, so I kept on going with my sisters to that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and my parents were still continuing to live near that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , that woman, and Saint Eloi until they moved officially the seals and then we moved back in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">But we only stayed there for about three weeks because then I decided I will no longer ever say I'm Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I will join the underground and when the Germans move in to the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">zone</span> in November, and that's--
QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about that, about when the Germans decided to occupy the southern--
ANSWER:  They just moved in--they didn't bother--it was the, all this time, I must say, it was the French who bothered us, that was the French, as I mentioned to you over the phone. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">The French were much more zealous. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">The official French, much more vicious against--to apply the racial things, as far as the government's concerned, than the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">At that time they weren't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="354"><span class="REGION">Vichy France</span> was very, very anti-Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION:  Were there other examples of things that they did to you or other people that you can think of? </span><span class="sentence" id="356">The seals--
ANSWER:  The seals, the fact that we couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the fact that they stamped our ration cards and our identification cards “Juif,” which made it difficult frequently, because if you dealt with those--for example there was a great food shortage in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and when you start in <span class="DLF">line</span> , people queue for four o'clock and suddenly you come with your “Juif’ there, sometimes people just pushed ahead of you and you weren't going to say anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">It's like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">occupied zone</span> , they had the yellow star we weren't yet to wear, but we had identity cards with “Juif’ stamped on it which was annoying.

<p><span class="sentence" id="359">QUESTION:  Were there any episodes of police brutality?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">QUESTION:  Nothing like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">ANSWER:  No, because we, unless we--yes--in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , for example, I was once hit by a guard because I was trying to get to--I was asking for a pass to go to my mother, to where my sister and mother were and he just hit me and called me “dirty Jew.” </span><span class="sentence" id="364">No, those were instances, but you see we kept such a low profile that we didn't have any exposure and there was very few Jews in the <span class="REGION">areas</span> where we were, or at least we knew about. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">No, that was sort of--<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sudrier</span> was the one and there was a lot of the newspapers were always attacking the Jews and if you wanted to be left alone, you usually had in your pocket one of the most anti-Semitic papers called Gringoire,'? </span><span class="sentence" id="366">which was like the Der Stuermer,”° later the Der Stuermer, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">That's the only way you were left alone is when you always affected not, being anti-Jewish, but in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , like I said, in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> it was a very anti-Semitic people were screaming, “Jew! </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Jew!” </span><span class="sentence" id="369">every time there's a name of a Jew, but otherwise, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I personally had no--except for Agde--that's what I'm saying, except for Agde, and the two or three instances where we were almost deported and the fact that they sealed us out of our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">QUESTION:  I think that we're almost out of tape, is that...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">ANSWER:  Well, there the Germans moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I joined the underground officially. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I was sworn in by Toto, which was the name of the--actually his name is Otto Giniesky, but he was called Toto Ginot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">QUESTION:  This was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I joined them, but that was about all. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I just--I just gave the oath and that's all and very soon after Germans moved in and so my parents again said we have to get out of this <span class="REGION">area</span> , and we still was living with my parents and we go to--and the few Jews that were there, including my cousin, who once lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> , we decided to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> and my sister went ahead, looking for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">QUESTION:  I'm going to stop you now so that they can change the tape, and we'll pick up.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Before we move on, we were chatting off camera a little bit more about daily life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">ANSWER:  Daily life was miserable; it was a life of daily fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">You went to sleep, you didn't know if the next morning there would be a rounding up. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">We knew about people rounding up. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">We knew people disappear, for example, we knew--at one point it became so worrisome that remember, I told you one of my cousins, the one, the only survivor from that--the oldest sister of my mother--she managed to sneak out from with her daughter to the non-occupied and she lived with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I forgot to tell you, she lived with us and her daughter, and her, because we were, we were such a large nuclear family. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">We were always raised together at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And at one point they became so terribly--the rumor mill--that she decided she wasn't safe in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> , and she went to live near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And that's when they, they reported--and the same time as we--the 26th of August or something--they rounded her up with her daughters, Helen and Dian. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Their names were Helen and Dian. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Her mother was deported and never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">That woman who finally lived with us--and she left us because she didn't feel 1t was safe any more--she was finally rounded up. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">The reason why we know, it is her daughter who was put in a camp of children and what happened 1s, it's one instance where the, where a bishop or a cardinal in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> --I think Gerlier--there's a Catholic, there's called a Catholic organizations, they took a number of people, dressed them as police people and came in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and kidnapped all the children and placed them with families. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">The daughter and those people who adopted her notified us about the mother having disappeared and that Diane was alive and she was still with them, the Rosenstiels. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">She's still wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">QUESTION:  How did you get enough to eat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">ANSWER:  Oh, that's why I was working in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So we didn't--in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> it was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">As a matter of fact, there were times when I would go out on the <span class="REGION">country side</span> , on the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and get dandelion so we could have salad once a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And then we--you know, dandelion's a terrible diuretic. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">It was a terrible problem, but no, we had very little to eat, that is--that was--a horrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">A change, I mean in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> , that was a big change, because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> you had to eat, but in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> it was very little and the only--the reason is that's why I worked in the <span class="DLF">gardens</span> , and with the farmers, because that's the only way I could have eaten, and see when I worked with the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">vineyards</span> , we would get wine as part of a salary and I would exchange the wine for food on the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">It was really terrible, and sometimes my sister would get up at four o’clock in the morning because she heard there was some carrots somewhere you know, and by the time her, by the time the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> would open at nine o'clock there were about carrots for 20 people and if you had stamped ”Jewish” on them, they wouldn't give them to you, so it was nothing easy for life. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">But the food wasn't easy for anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">QUESTION:  One other question about when you saw there was southern Jews under <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy</span> : Did you have a sense of what the general attitude was about the Vichy administration and the general French attitude?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">ANSWER:  The French attitude was favorable to Vichy, very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And I can tell you this was going on in general, except for individual people. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Some individuals were absolutely wonderful, you know the old type of Clemanceaus, like the Républicains. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">But others would have a general attitude of anti-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">All French have always been intellectual anti-Jewish anyhow, ever since Dreyfus, you know, Zola. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">But you have some people like Zola or others who, you know, those were individuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I must say the French population in the south was very, very pro-Vichy. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">They approved everything and they were sort of, sort of giving that feeling, well, everything was the fault of Léon Blum and his popular front, that Jews Léon Blum and Daniel Mayer and all these guys, oh, there was an attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">But individually, certain people are definitely against persecution and when they knew you were in trouble, they were ready to help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">It's a dichotomy. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I mean I have people, they were just wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Oh, like these people that saved my niece, she's not a niece, she's a second cousin, yeah, whom I see--she's in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">But those were Catholic people. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">She, the woman, was married to a Jew, Rosenstiel, but she's the one who instigated this whole, this saving of the children and kept raising the child as Jewish so she wouldn't forget her grandparents, because her grandparents were very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">But the girl isn't Jewish any more, but she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">She tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">So these individual people are just sublime, that's what I'm saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">The sense of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy</span> was extremely popular government. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">They were listening to them, there were very few who were actually for the British. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">It may have been also the hate of the British and the hate of the leftist movement, which identified with the Jews, especially Léon Blum. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I don't know if you remember Léon Blum, who was the Prime Minister who instituted all these beautiful, liberal reforms, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Social Security and all this that <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> has, all the workers even now that they have, they owe it to Léon Blum and his government and yet they were so happy, “Oh, we got rid of all those Jews,” etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Yeah, there was a very anti-Jewish feel, but that's not just <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I can tell you later on, even when I got to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , I faced this from the Belgians, who were, the Belgians who were officially on the <span class="REGION">British side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">See, when I wanted to volunteer for the Belgians they said, “We can't accept you,” and later on I said “Well, I had no papers,” and then when the other Belgian says, “But we never had any papers he says, “I bet you're Jewish,” I said, “Yes,” he says, “Well, yeah.” </span><span class="sentence" id="434">We never had their attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">He wouldn't like, even--the other people knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">So that's not surprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And that's why we were always living in fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Every day we knew something is going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And it did, finally it happened, it happened, at a tremendous scale, which is a miracle that we escaped that. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Never understood why.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">QUESTION:  So your family decided to move to the <span class="REGION">Italian zone</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">ANSWER:  Yeah, and so my sister went out and found--as a matter of fact, she found a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">The Italians, who were making every effort to protect the Jews, I must say that, they were wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">So, as soon as we knew about it, again the great, I knew it, and the only thing the risk was to get over to the <span class="REGION">Italian zone</span> without a pass and she mentions to go back and forth and then our parents immediately went over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And I stayed with my sister to pack whatever we had and there again is an example. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">When we finally get to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , there was a station master, grumpy guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And we said, “We want to ship our belongings to this--” “Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">You can't.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="449">Say why?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="450">Jewish?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="451">Yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Then he says, “It's forbidden.” </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I asked, “Since when?” </span><span class="sentence" id="454">He says, “Since today.” </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I said, “But that's all we have.” </span><span class="sentence" id="456">He says, “Fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I just remembered, you shipped it yesterday.” </span><span class="sentence" id="458">The man didn't know us, just an individual, that's what I'm saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I have some very, very wonderful memories about individuals, some of whose name I don't even know. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">So we shipped our things, and by that time I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> and discovered that my chief that I had--the chief of the Organisation Juive de Combat.”! </span><span class="sentence" id="461">It was first called AJ, Armée Juif,’” and then it was changed to--you have the paper there-- ’Organisation Juive de Combat.” </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And I accidentally ran in to him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> ; I was looking for a group. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">But then we said, he said, “Before we can use you, you have to have French papers,” and he says, “I don't know yet if I can trust them or you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And so he handed me over a discharge paper of somebody by the name of Pierre Louis Vignot. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I was a little older and I looked extremely young then, I was only about, I must have been just 19, but I looked like a 15, 16 year old boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I was a skinny little rabbit, I mean, not to say skinny, I was skinny. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I was about 125 pounds or something, and he gave me that paper because the Asti Germans had moved in to the occupied, on the non-occupied zone, they disbanded the armistice army, and so somehow, either the piece of paper was real or it was beautifully manufactured, because it was a real discharge certificate of a person by the name of Pierre Louis Vinot, who was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Béthune</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Béthune</span> we found out later had been totally bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> had been bombed and all the papers of anybody born there were destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">So that was convenient. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">He didn't tell me how to do it, so I just went to the mairie~’ or the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> , where my parents lived, which was a big mistake because I wasn't officially living there any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Yes, the underground--he had assigned me a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , a <span class="INT_SPACE">safe room</span> that they had rented.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">My parents lived six kilometers or 10 kilometers out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> in Val d’Eybens. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And I went to that mairie because I didn't know any other mairie and I remember being there and the man looking again--it was one of those militia people, an older guy--and he looked at me, he says, “Come back in the back here,” and I said, “Uh- oh, he caught me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">QUESTION:  The last I remember, you were talking about you were going to the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> of the-- *! </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Jewish Organization of Combat (French). *</span><span class="sentence" id="478">2 Jewish Army 3 Town or <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> (French).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  Yeah, and there was a militia, a chief of the militia, who was actually processing the--making identity cards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION:  Okay, I remember, and the man said, “Come with me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  “Come in the back.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  [Referring to technical problems] Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Let's roll the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Oh, I'm sorry, I did pick up-- Oh, I'm sorry, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  Well, I went and I think there was a major mistake which could have cost--there was a major mistake because I went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I had no address to give. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">When I went there I realized that the man in charge of the ID cards was a militia man, an officer, and he then went, after I filled out the papers, he filled out the papers, asked me to come in back and looked at me very sternly and I said, “There. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I am caught,” you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And all he said 1s, “Eyes blue, hair brown.” </span><span class="sentence" id="490">All he wanted was to have a look at me because he wants to give the details, and then he said, “Well...” and I knew that when you take an ID card, usually they fill out the papers and then they stamp it and you go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">He said, “You'll have to come back in two weeks from now,” and I said, “Why?” </span><span class="sentence" id="492">He said, “Well, because this--we don't deliver cards any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">It's now very serious and we do it through the prefecture de police,” and I didn't know what, and I said, “Fine,” and then I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And then I went to see my chief and he says, “That was a stupid thing to do, but now that you did it, he’s either going to have--if you have the courage and you go there, you either--you'll be the only person in the entire <span class="REGION">region</span> who's going to have an identity without an accomplice, which means--” and then he started to explain to me, because he says, “You're going to be assigned in the manufacturing of false papers and distributing false papers and bringing them over to various <span class="NPIP">places</span> as you can see on that certificate.” </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And I said, “Where is it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="496">and then he gave me the explanation, he says, “There 1s virtually nobody who has what we call true-true-false papers--false identity--and if you get that prefecture card, you're going to have the only one with true-true-stamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">There's not going to be an accomplice, so you can never be caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">The second thing 1s...” then he explained to me, “...some of them you're going to make and we have rubber stamps and we have forms that we buy,” etcetera. “</span><span class="sentence" id="499">They're not going to be perfect and those are called false-false-false papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Then there's going to be--you're going to have contacts as you're going on, you're going to work in mairies, and we're going to find some people who we can bribe and they're going to make it at the mairie and keep a record, but that's somebody who's not totally reliable--that's going to be the false-true-false papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And then we're going to have--somewhere we're going to have a person that is one of ours in the mairie, he's a resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">But he can be caught and under torture he can tell, that he's going to be again. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And those are going to be true-false-false papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">So that's going to be the different categories of papers.” </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And that's after he says, “But we're only going to use you after you have your own papers, so...” I don't like myself in that picture, so that's, I look like my uncle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">QUESTION:  Let me ask you a few questions before we--
ANSWER:  Did you pick that up, these categories?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Before we learn more about your underground work, I just want to understand, your whole family is now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">ANSWER:  Yes, my whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I am the only one at that point who is not living with my family; they don't even declare me with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And we know that there is a comparative safety as compared to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> , where we were under <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy</span> , but with German, Germans looking down on them, and their tragedy. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">The Italians prevent this <span class="REGION">area</span> under their control to be as mean as the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vichy</span> and the <span class="REGION">German zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">As I mentioned to you until--you asked me if <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> , the trip of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> , the only risk we took gravely is that we were traveling back and forth between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> during this move, without the proper papers, which 1s, which could have led us direct to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">You see, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> frequently were in the control, were controlled by field gendarmerie,~* together with the French police. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">This is one of the things that I was doing, too--later on-- is traveling and knowing where to come up, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I learned that later, but at that time we just took terrible chances and you know the atmosphere of taking a trip like this and knowing that you are going to be caught, you have a 50 percent chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">It was a terrible ordeal, but we did it and that's what I'm saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">It's the only problem that happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">QUESTION:  Now, when you decided to join the underground--
ANSWER:  That was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">How did you know about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="522">How did you decide what organization to join? </span><span class="sentence" id="523">How did all of this happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">ANSWER:  I met a young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">That was a pure accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I don't remember his name... Abie-- his name was Abie, a little fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">He used to be from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">He used to be the son of the baker, the man who delivered our bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">He met me once accidentally in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> , astonished that I was there and then told me about the existence of the underground in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I don't know what happened to him because he was not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And he told me, “You know, you should join. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">There is a new underground here,” and he is the one who got me in touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">We used to call him Abie the baker boy, you know, because he used to come in the morning and we liked him very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">He used to deliver bread in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">He was a Polish little fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And he is the one who talked me into--if I hadn't met him, I don't think I would have ever known about it and that's how I ** Total force of the gendarme (French). </span><span class="sentence" id="537">joined the underground and then again, when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> --oh, no--I met him again in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">When I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> , you know, it's--I happened to come down from--and there he is again. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And I said “Abie, what's going on?” </span><span class="sentence" id="540">and he says, “You know, the same people are here,” and then he said, “You met them in the dark, but I know you can meet them 1n the light.” </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I don't know what happened to Abie after that because he was not part of our group later on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">QUESTION:  So there wasn't an agreement in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> to meet with certain people once you arrived in--
ANSWER:  No, no, because you see, it was only the--almost two days before I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> that I joined, it was a very secretive--and that's maybe why Toto, the chief, acted a little bit strange in the beginning, because it was such a secretive thing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">It was in the dark, you made an oath in the dark on a revolver. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I mean it was--I thought it was a lot of--I was sort of a little cynical about it and maybe I acted a little bit supercilious or something because I think Toto told me in the beginning he was very sort of diffident, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">That's maybe why he handed me that discharge paper saying the hell with it, he's not--I'm not going to do anything special for him, but when I got the real papers and when he saw that I have guts, because he said, “Now it's up to you,” and I said, “Would you go?” </span><span class="sentence" id="546">he says, “The only thing I can tell you, if you ever get those papers, you have the best papers and you're going to be very useful to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">On the other hand, I'm not sure if I would do it in your <span class="NPIP">place</span> because there is a big risk involved.” </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And I said, rather than-- ”if I want to do a thing, I'm not joining the underground not to take risks.” </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So I took the risk and got my papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">QUESTION:  Was Toto also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah, Toto was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I had an--I never met him except in the dark, that single day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">QUESTION:  So the whole organization moved?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">ANSWER:  The whole organization moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">He actually created, I think, the whole organization, and he and somebody by the name of Simon Levitte created--I think he must have been stimulated by Simon Levitte who was a marvelous guy--created the organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">They even rented a little chalet in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Michallons</span> where gradually all those people started getting together, and it was sort of officially an <span class="REGION">area</span> where young people got together to sing songs and things like that, but really it was the center. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">There were two centers at that time, one was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> of Miss Madame Latchiver in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">QUESTION:  Who was she?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">ANSWER:  She was just a woman who--a Jewish-Frenchwoman--who was a widow with two children, who somehow got to know the--I think she knew the wife of Toto, and gradually everybody found it convenient to come to her, and she said, “You do whatever you want,” and in her <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> was actually the--in her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> was all the rubber stamps and everything was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And we used to have these, all these sessions in her <span class="NPIP">places</span> and people who came from hiding for a day or two always slept in her <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">She was the center of activity in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> and the second <span class="NPIP">place</span> was up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Michelon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="562">That's where I got to be assigned of manufacturing and distributing papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I wasn't the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I was one of them, and then later on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> the Italians had set up two in our <span class="REGION">area</span> , two nice <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">resort villages</span> that because of the war weren't used. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Where they concentrated Jews in various <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> , they called it résidences surveillées,”> but they claimed that this would be that they felt that one day the Germans will push them out and then they will take their Jews to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> where they're less persecuted, which isn't true, because they were persecuted. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I mean the Finzi-Contini*® thing, you know, but they had--they meant well and actually I think Toto had, from what I understood, had connections with the Italians and had received their guarantees and that's why we left the Italians alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">There was never anything against Italians by the underground, at least by the Jewish underground.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">QUESTION:  Well, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> , just the general scene, were there a lot of refugees there from all over?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">ANSWER:  I don't know, again, I was not in the main group. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I was just with the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">There were quite a few, yes, because in the underground we're all Jewish and we were quite a group there. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">But I was mainly having a small group of very active people, one of them is George Schneck who became--is now the president of the Jewish Consistory in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , of the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Another one was Adolph, who went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , who then later on became ambassador in <span class="COUNTRY">Peru</span> , of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , he was one of the Shin-Bet people, and there was Toto. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">There was a pretty large group but we didn't know much about them because we didn't want to know much about them in case we get caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">There was an infiltration of Communists, and I think earlier, when you asked me in the beginning was there ever anybody I didn't trust, I trusted them, but then became very suspicious about two guys, Joe and Max. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Max later on became a big wheel in the French Communists after the war, and their girlfriend Charlotte. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I think they were selling us down the <span class="DLF">road</span> somewhere because some people got caught, and I wonder if it weren't those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">The second thing is the French underground had nothing to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">They wanted us, to use us only to get the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">They had this idea Jews have money. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And we had very little to do with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">But you see, I had a very fine--remember I joined them in November--didn't see them until December or January and only stayed with them from January until August, with our group. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">So our group had definitive jobs for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I was making false papers, I was distributing false papers, I was exploring because of my farming skills, I worked with farmers again, and I used to go out with George or others and look for <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> , should we start, because we were preparing to become a fighting group. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">At that time we were not yet a combat group, but we were preparing to *> Supervised residences * The title of this film is The Garden of the Finzi-Continis. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">become a combat group. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And so I was going exploring with farmers, where we could have <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> , where we could have strategically located <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and that was my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">In addition to that, I had to bring--once we had manufactured papers--I had to bring them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Gervais</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Megeéve</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I also was a sort of a liaison to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> , which was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">occupied zone</span> , because they felt I had been several times going back and forth without a pass, somehow I had an intuitive feeling on how to get people across, and so sometimes I was just sent over to look, to which they say, ’the family's coming,””’ just go in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and watch what happened and when you go down and you feel that there's an inspection coming, just get down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and stay, so I did it a few times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">QUESTION:  And what would you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">ANSWER:  I would just go, I would just sit there in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> while they were there and then when I would look out and I see there's a field gendarmerie. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">I would go down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they would go down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And then when I thought it was clear I would go back because I couldn't talk to them, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Once I--a funny story happened--there was a Jewish family who, they had good papers so nobody's--and then the Germans and the Frenchmen came in and there was a farmer, a typical 100 percent farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">He was eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">He had a sandwich, he was eating onion, and so suddenly the French policeman said, “You must be Jewish,” and there was this whole group of family who were Jewish, they had false papers, but they were Jewish, and they bothered this farmer because he was eating onion. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">You know if it wasn't so tragic, I would have laughed, because he says, “You are Jewish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="598">He went to check him, brought him back later on, let him go. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">But these are the kind of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I was bringing them papers, then, just to make sure that they get themselves out of the trouble, I would show them where to go down, where to go up because I traveled a lot and I knew where it was safe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">QUESTION:  Now as Pierre Vinot, you were just considered a Catholic French?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">ANSWER:  Yeah, well, I was living in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , number 16 <span class="DLF">Grande Rue</span> , above a bordello, and it was a safe haven because you see, again, they had picked that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and on the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> there was a bordello, because there was a red light, and so they had picked up because you could go in and out. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And then I had this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where this woman was living, and I had a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there, and I wasn't there much either, because most of the time I was in the <span class="DLF">farms</span> all around, so traveling a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Many times I was sleeping at Madame Jeanne, this famous Madame Jeanne Latchiver; she was a marvelous woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">That's where I got to meet all these people who later on were deported, like Marianne Cohen, Mila Racine--all these people who tried to get children over and they betrayed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Somebody betrayed them, I don't know who--around there--Laubert(ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about the process of making all these papers and distributing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="608">ANSWER:  That's what I explained to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Number one, we had--somehow we had a printer, he was a Communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">He was Gregoire I think, he had a <span class="BUILDING">printing shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">I didn't have much *7 According to the interviewee, this was a code phrase that the group used. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">to do with him, it was Toto again. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">He would print us the forms, he would make us the rubber stamps, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="614">These forms--we would just get the pictures, have the form where they were just rubber stamps, because my papers had the watermark print, you know the--that was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">If, in an emergency where we had to have quickly some people come over from, yeah, families coming from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">occupied zone</span> who would send--I would go over there, bring them the papers, but we would make them. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">These were little cardboard kind of, kind of cardboard kind of forms. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">They fold and you fill them out and you stamped them, and they were given. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">They're worthless because if ever they would check--can I, can you stop one second? </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I have to blow my nose. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">See, they were worthless because if anybody checked, really, if the police would have any suspicion, they would get those people over, just make a phone call to a man, you know--there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computers</span> then, but just call and said, “Do you have any registration?” </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I would say no, so they were totally false. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">They were false-false-false papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Also we had a few people in <span class="REGION">areas</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Doméne</span> , etcetera, where I didn't know what the difference was except that I used to go and pick them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I sit in small <span class="BUILDING">city halls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I call them mairies, you know that's--we used to have either employees there, who are accomplices because either they were doing it for money or they were resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I didn't know the difference between them, but they would say ”’Today, go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Domene</span> ...” for example, “... Domene, and you pick up a bundle of things.” </span><span class="sentence" id="627">These were registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">In other words, you had the background papers there. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">If the police called, the guy would say “Yes, they are here, these people,” but you had a weakness-- they had an accomplice. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">That accomplice could be somebody that we thought was trustworthy, in which case they were true- false-false; or where there were two true-false; or the guy could be trusted, in that case they were true-true-false. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I mean we had all these things, and I would pick them up and bring them over. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Now there was always a danger there, either a person was caught and somebody was waiting for me to come and pick them up or the people was a double agent or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">It never happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">QUESTION:  Were you afraid constantly that it--
ANSWER:  No, I was only afraid that if they would stop me I would become nervous and I would show that there's something wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I was never--that was a strange thing, not even when I, the most difficult part, even the day that I was conduct--I don't know was. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">I think it's the youth, the fact that our life was so tense all the time, that these things seemed to be sort of a relief. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I don't remember, looking back that I was afraid, except, for example, I remember one day coming back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Gervais</span> , where I had just given all these papers to the people, distributed them, came back, had nothing, and suddenly there was big, ID check, I'm sorry, ID check. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">The police was there, the militia was there, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I wasn't afraid for me, because I had the--but I was afraid that I might not look relaxed and that they would see I'm nervous and then they would start asking them and then I, I might betray. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I was much more afraid ever to be nervous and to betray people, but otherwise I wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And so this was about the life, I was also the liaison person with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="642"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> was the other, was the real big center. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">We didn't--I didn't--know that, but that's where Polonski, who was known at the time by the name of Pol, was running a big operation where most of the people after I left of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> moved to, and Toto moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> , because that became the big center because at one time when the Germans, when the Germans occupied even the <span class="REGION">Italian zone</span> , there was no more reason to have two centers. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">So a small group was left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="645">My two sisters, who before I left joined the underground, became much more active than I, because then they had become more of a--they started using the <span class="NPIP">places</span> that I had found. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">They also were much more active in the false papers business. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And I think one of my sisters even got hurt at one point, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="648">QUESTION:  Did you have much sense of the overall organization or did you really operate with a few people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">ANSWER:  Very little sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">I think the organization was still very disjointed. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Our operation was one operation and we thought it was all. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I only got an inkling later, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> , but I didn't realize that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> was the major center. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I only got--when it became--when I became, I wanted to tell you, after a certain time I could not use--I could not stay Pierre Vinot because as Pierre Vinot I was born in 1919, four years older than I really was. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">There was suddenly--the French had suddenly made an order that all people born after-- before--1921 had to report to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="655">You had to go, mandatory labor, for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="656">At least you had to register, and so I could no longer be Pierre Vinot, and I had to become Arthur Vergnaud. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I think it was still Pierre, I have to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">I don't remember because they weren't exactly good, there was not longer any good for anyone it was one of those little cards made by Doméne. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I remember the mairie, at which point, one morning, I--I used to sneak in very early in the morning at six o'clock in the morning to my where my parents lived to chop the wood and bring them sometimes the food that I had collected in the <span class="DLF">farms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And I come there in the morning and there is a little girl, Fischer, she was a neighbor, and she came to me, and she says that--she came to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> and she came up with a little milk thing and she says to me, “You go and pick up the milk,” and I couldn't understand this little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">She was maybe nine years, 11 years old--nine years. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">She says, “Police,” and so I knew I couldn't go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and so I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Later on I discovered they got my poor father and my sister, took them all the way to somewhere, and they grilled them all day long by saying, “Where is your son?” </span><span class="sentence" id="664">and he says, “My son is only four years old.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="665">No, no, no, the other one, the one that's in the resistance, the one that worked there on this <span class="DLF">farm</span> and there on this <span class="DLF">farm</span> and he's in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> and he distributes flyers,” and they didn't know what I was distributing so they thought I was distributing propaganda, you know--he's in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And so I knew that somebody had betrayed me because they didn't even know my name, they just knew that I existed and they knew how I looked, and so at which point, when I told this to Toto because he didn't know about it, he said, “Well, I can't use you any more, but we can use you now because we do want to have more liaisons to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> and we would like to make a channel and you be the guinea pig with whoever you want to recruit to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> ,” and I said, “But I thought that <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> is impossible.” </span><span class="sentence" id="667">He said, “Exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">That's why we want you to try it,” because nowadays nobody had crossed to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> for the last year--smuggled in, because you have a border area. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">You have 50 kilometers which is zone interite.”* </span><span class="sentence" id="670">If they catch you, they shoot you, if you don't have a certain color pass, and so it's almost impossible to get over, but we have a passer who we want to use and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> is looking for volunteers that are desperate and then ultimately we'll set our goal that you should then try to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time because--I forgot to tell you that the, at that time the AG, or the OGC was very Zionistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">All wanted ultimately to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and so that's what I'm saying was so--it was such a comedy because they kept on saying, “You go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> and then you try it and then within 48 hours you have to report to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barcelona</span> , to our agent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barcelona</span> and they will get you over to...” That was nonsense because it didn't exist, this whole channel was sort of just a trying field. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">So the first time--I then went with George Schneck, my best friend, we were buddies and, you know, brothers, and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> again, without a pass, without, but I, then I was where I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">We were hidden at that time and we were trained for weeks by--in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of Madame Knout. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Her name was Rachel Knout, K-n-o-u-t. I mentioned to you she was the granddaughter of Scriabine, and she was not Jewish but she was married to Knout who was a big wheel in that organization and--oh, no--he was deported, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Yeah, Knout was deported, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And Rachel Knout, she was a wonderful woman, with her children there, she reminded me of that Madame Jeanne because she had about four or five children. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">She had the little--and everybody was hiding there, and she was active. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">She was shot later on, on the 28th of July, 1944, she was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">There was also another guy by the name of Gerard and he also was shot, later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And then they send me and George to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nakache</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Nakache was a Olympic champion of swimming--swimming champion of 1938 or something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">He had opened the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> and he trained people physically for the underground.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">QUESTION:  He was Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">ANSWER:  Yeah, Nakache was a, Nakache was a--but they didn't know that, see, Nakache was an Algerian Jew or a Moroccan Jew or something like this, Nakache. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And he trained us you know, etcetera, and then what happened it--George's family, his mother was, she was from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and she was absolutely against him continuing because she said she knows the nihilists, and we're probably going to be--because they did train us how to jump from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and things like this and so she, I don't know, George decided he wasn't going. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">So I had to go all the way back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> and try to recruit different people, which I wasn't, it wasn't such a good bunch because George and I were really idealistic and these other guys, they just wanted to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">I got five people, one I didn't know, he was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Megeve</span> , and I had Nick, Charles and the brothers Levine. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> they gave me another guy that was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , Armand Herchkowitz, he was the sixth 8 Destruction zone; from “interitus,” meaning “death” (Latin). </span><span class="sentence" id="690">guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">So I got six guys and the French underground gave us five more people and I became in charge of this group.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">QUESTION:  You said the French underground gave you more people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="693">ANSWER:  Not me. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Yeah, the French underground, like I said, they did not work with us, but Pol Polonski and Jack Roytman, who were the two guys in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> , told us we--because the French underground apparently furnished--supplied--the passer. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">The Jewish underground was financing it, see that's where we--
QUESTION:  But there was a relationship?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, there was a relationship, but it was not the real--it was sort of a--you could feel a sort of contempt: “You provide us with money,” you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">There was no other interchanging except that I was told in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> , “You're going to get whatever you get. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">There are going to be five guys and you're going to be responsible for them, too.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">QUESTION:  There was no sense of a common enemy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">ANSWER:  Yeah, but that way, like I said, in '43, the population was still very, very pro--not real pro-German, but anti-British, anti-Jewish, and I'm not sure that the--and I had the feeling that the French underground was had only started, the major, the most strongest part of the French underground were the Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">They were really anti-German, because they were anti-Russian, not for any other reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">They were very unconcerned with what they did to the Jews, and they couldn't care less. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">The Jewish underground was simply because they felt, otherwise they would have been part of the French underground, but they felt that there was discrimination against the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="704">QUESTION:  So their goals were different?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">ANSWER:  Their goals were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">The Jewish underground, the way I knew it, both in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> and--had an aim to get the Jews as much as they could, either fighting the Germans or getting them to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">That was at that time--the Jewish resistance was very Zionist-oriented. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">The Communists that infiltrated them tried to switch it differently, made them Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">The French sort of ignored them except when it came to--at least in my time. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Now later on, I think towards the very end, they were working together, but you see the French resistance, no matter what they say, was Johnny Come Lately, you know, all those people that you see in movies, etcetera.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">ANSWER:  Even the second D.B.”’ friend, who went through the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> without the French underground, went the same passage and he joined the French army in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> , he also said that was, first of all, he could have done without us, secondly they were so *” Division Blindée, (blind division), (French). </span><span class="sentence" id="712">antisemitic in these, in the French army. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">The French army of liberation, de Clercq and all these people, were terrible antisemites. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">So I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> , I was hidden once in M--by Rachel Knout. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I got the training, I went back, I recruited five people, they gave me a sixth one, then after a couple of days they, Pol and Jack, they gave me instructions how, what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">We got to some <span class="NPIP">place</span> which--it was my memory, I have such a great memory, I can't remember that <span class="NPIP">place</span> --and there we were hidden in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="717">We got the five Frenchmen with us, the five non-Jewish guys and we--and then--his name was Bertrand Borde, yeah, he came. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">He was about seven foot tall; no secret that I'm a pretty short guy, and most of the people except one Frenchman, one, he was a law student, was the only tall guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">All the others were relatively--I mean my size or even shorter, and he took us for two days in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> on a absolutely incredible tempo. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Then they abandoned us in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , and then we had another two days without food in the middle of storms, etcetera, and we finally got to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">QUESTION:  Now, tell me a little bit about that journey to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Was this a fairly easy crossing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">ANSWER:  Oh, no, this was a horrible <span class="DLF">crossing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="724">As a matter of fact, the team--the team after us I think lost three people. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Two died and one broke his leg and they had to abandon-- they don't know what happened and the next team didn't make it at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="726">QUESTION:  Why was it so horrible?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="727">ANSWER:  First of all it was--you start off almost in open thing--in <span class="DLF">fields</span> where there are <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German villages</span> , for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Whenever you crossed, you crossed towards dusk because at night you couldn't see, and when we passed any of those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , for example, there were Germans in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And you have to remember, when we passed I had to start--let's see--no, I was always the last one because the guy before that, the passer would go, and then when you hardly see the passer. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">The next one would go, and by that time it became dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Then you had to get into <span class="DLF">fields</span> that go up like this where the people who work in those <span class="DLF">fields</span> are attached by cords to work in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , you know, with a sickle. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Then you start, then it became so bad that you have to do it in daylight, and you're absolutely a target there. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">If they see you, they shoot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">You don't have a pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">The terrain is terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">After the <span class="DLF">fields</span> you get into the most horrible rocks and you know the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> goes up and it goes down. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">It's north of <span class="COUNTRY">Honduras</span> and, for example, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , when you are on the top and you want to start going down, you don't realize that when you go down let's say 100 feet, there's nothing underneath and some of our people almost died this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">There was this guy that I got from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Megeéve</span> , he was the most undisciplined guy ever, and he would just go down there and then he would stop because he almost fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">These were extremely dangerous and then there were <span class="DLF">paths</span> where you had about, I don't know, this much to slide on the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">I couldn't do it now, it just how we did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">It was just horrible and at times the guide did us--made us do it in the middle of the night, and when I found out what we were doing with the morning when we woke up because then he would stop, and he would fall asleep because he drank all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And then he would say, I would wake up and I says, “Ready to go?” </span><span class="sentence" id="743">He says, “That.” </span><span class="sentence" id="744">I said, “We did that in the middle of the night?” </span><span class="sentence" id="745">He says, “You wouldn't have dared to do it during the day.” </span><span class="sentence" id="746">It was physically one of the most dangerous mountain climbing things that you can imagine, besides even if it was August there were patches of ice, and you don't realize it in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , you're seeing sort of a, seeing some snow and you think “Oh, well, that's just snow, that's a patch of ice,” which in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> looks like if it's a <span class="DLF">yard</span> and it's 10 <span class="DLF">yards</span> and you slide down. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And once you slide, you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">So there was a dangerous--it was dangerous for two reasons: number one, it was the most impractical thing; that's why he picked it and he knew his way, he was a professional smuggler. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">The second thing is you were in open; at night it was too dangerous physically, you could kill yourself, and people killed themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Secondly, during the day, you were exposed to anybody who saw you--shooting, you know, and the Germans were patrolling. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">It was a terrible thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I went back there, 1990, to look at the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">It's the most awe-inspiring <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> that you can dream of. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">It's north of <span class="COUNTRY">Honduras</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="756">It's a terrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">QUESTION:  Did the training that they were giving you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse--</span> 
ANSWER:  Yeah, terrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">QUESTION:  --help you at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="759">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah, because I don't think I could have done it and also the fact that I lived in the mountains of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> and my job was to go all the time in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I was away sometimes for two days in a row just climbing <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and looking for things. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">That was also good training, and I must say in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">I forgot to tell you, Toto had organized a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> there where we would get training, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="763">QUESTION:  Where you were crossing, did you think you'd make it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="764">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Once we started, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">After the first day I said, “I won't make it, definitely not.” </span><span class="sentence" id="767">But we had no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">You remember when you don't have a choice? </span><span class="sentence" id="769">When you don't have a choice, you can do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">I was with my brother, who is 15 years younger, in 1990, he says, “I cannot believe you did that,” because even on the side, on the <span class="REGION">Spanish side</span> , where it looks much less forbidding, it looks horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">On the <span class="REGION">Spanish side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And once we were on the <span class="REGION">Spanish side</span> , we just went down. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">It was all the way down and it was fine, but the <span class="REGION">French side</span> , in the beginning where we started these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , where we saw the German patrols, I mean we saw the Germans and when that crazy guy who was drunk all the time, he had a big bottle of--he had two bottles, one we brought, because they told us, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> again--the French have this thing that if you don't have calories, drink alcohol, it gives you calories. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">So here we had sugar and they said take a bottle of wine because when you feel cold in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="775">So Bertrand took it from us and he had one himself, and he just kept on drinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">But obviously he knew his job. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And he walked at a terrible pace and for example when I started seeing those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> that we crossed and that 11 people--no there were 12 and the passer--we had to go every time to those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> that were--I thought we couldn't make it because we're going to get caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Then, where we passed those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and I started, he started showing us that we have to go in this open thing and I said, “But we're targets,” and he says, “That's the way to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Ah,” he says, “It's too, so dangerous, the Germans don't venture here,” which he probably was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Then where they abandoned us, and I started realizing, when he said, “You know, you see there's a round <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> and there's a long <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Once you are out to the long <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> , you are in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And I realized that this is--you can see it, but before that you have to climb down and up and down and up and that these are some, some absolutely impossible <span class="NPIP">places</span> to climb up, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="784">You go down and suddenly you see that you're over a 300-400 feet drop and that the only thing that you have is a little <span class="DLF">path</span> going along this thing, and then one of my boys lost his glasses, you know, in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bush</span> and so I had to give him my glasses and I'm--then I became near-sighted you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">I'm not--he was terrible, he was blind like a bat, and so I had to give him my glasses, so you understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">It was a horrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">I was sure we wouldn't make it.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Okay, so you made it into <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="791">ANSWER:  Yeah, we made it into <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="792">It was the--now, you asked me about the sixth that I recruited, the one from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Megéve</span> was apparently from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I don't remember his name because he also--I blocked the ones that gave me trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">He was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> and was supposed to be in the Betar*’--which was a Revisionist thing, you know, the Jabotinsky?! </span><span class="sentence" id="795">group--and he, oh, he was a way back. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">He was big Zionist, you see, but he was sort of very volatile and never listened to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">The two, Nick and Charles, they were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="798">They claimed to be Zionists, but Charles was very subdued. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">He was just--I think they wanted to get out, and so--because they never joined the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">The brothers Levine, Ira and Simon, they were true Zionists because I think they were from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> and they really wanted to join the army, so they were just regular guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , they joined the army, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">So I think Nick, Nick--he was no good. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">The other one also joined the army as a matter of fact, so they were real. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">They weren't the biggest, they weren't my kind of guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">I would have wanted to have George and Ado, you know, who were really hot stuff, but they didn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And then the Frenchmen, I didn't know, and--except I had a lot of respect for the law student because he seemed to be the real stuff, and I had an impression that the farmer was the real stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I didn't like the barber at all, I think he was a pimp who just was trying to get out, and I don't remember the other two. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">They were just, probably just very dull figures and, you know you had, you're so concentrated on what you were doing in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and trying to stay alive every single second, and I was more--I was not afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">I sure was sure we won't make it, but again if you ask me if I was afraid, no, but I was very, very, very concerned that, because of me, all the others are going to get it, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">That was my only concern.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="811">QUESTION:  Didn't you have to trust the people you were traveling with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="812">ANSWER:  Yeah, well I trusted--I had no concern about not trusting them, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">No, I trusted them completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">I was very disappointed in the one that I thought was the nicest, Nick, who, as we got in the <span class="DLF">trench</span> , started holding me responsible for not having cigarettes, for example, and I mean he was a pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">I was a little disappointed also in the fact that, what's his name, the other one from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Megéve</span> was not very disciplined. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I think he should be °° Vladimir Jabotinsky’s Zionist youth movement which peaked during the 1930s in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="817">Cecil Roth, ed., </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Encyclopaedia Judaica (<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> : <span class="BUILDING">Keter Publishing House</span> , 1971), s.v. “</span><span class="sentence" id="819">Betar,” >! </span><span class="sentence" id="820">Jabotinsky, Vladimir (1880-1940), Zionist activist, founder of the Jewish Legion during W.W.I, and head of Betar and Revisionist movements. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Encyclopaedia Judaica (<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> : <span class="BUILDING">Keter Publishing House</span> , 1971), s.v. “</span><span class="sentence" id="822">Jabotinsky”’. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">more--he was a Jabotinsky fellow, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">He should be very disciplined and poor Armand, he had to get out, he had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">Armand was the one I got in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> , he was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , and he just wanted to get out, no motivation.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1142">QUESTION:  It must have been wonderful to see your parents again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1143">ANSWER:  I can tell you, that was something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">And my brother who was so little had become a fair eight, nine year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">It's been good, the feeling that this family was totally intact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">That was the--because none of the families who had stayed had been intact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">I mean, one of my aunts, Dora, and her husband and two of her children, one never came back, one came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , but he was very disturbed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">One was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> and one never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">And the second one never came, my brother, the brother of my mother, never came back and the older sister plus her daughter never came back, so that, for my mother, we all used to live within two or four blocks of each other and the only ones that were saved are the ones had a brother, for some reason one of the brothers of my mother, he was a Mexican. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">I don't know for some reason he was Mexican, but he was Mexican, so he got out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with all his four sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">And the second one, she managed, also before, as soon as the war was over, she was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">Oh, that's the one with-the mother of the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nevers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">So those people were saved because they left before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1154">QUESTION:  So your feeling is that your family, by basically running away, was able to save itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1155">ANSWER:  Not only that, and the fact is that we joined the underground and that I still feel that we Jews were much too passive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And those who weren't passive, either they died for a cause or they didn't die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">That's my feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">That's why I never feel that appeasement works and I still don't understand why, when everybody knew they were dying they didn't make something like the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">If you have to die, somebody has to pay for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">And that's why, I mean, right now I get afraid of--occasionally, I get worried about things, but then I wasn't, because it wasn't because I was a hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">I was not, I was just a meek, little fellow, but the thing 1s, I kept on saying, “We're going to die.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">I was sure we were not going to make the war, because that was the feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">Things were, you know every day you would hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">You had no news except that Europe was shrinking, taking <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> out of this thing, you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> was disappearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165"><span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was bombed for 76 days in a row and you know when you heard the BBC, whenever you used to hear the BBC, and then you wouldn't hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">We're going too, we lost there, we lost <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tripoli</span> , we lost <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Benghazi</span> , we lost this, nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">You were just going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> and then you had an impression that they were negotiating and you had the feeling as a matter of fact, you had a feeling it can't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">It can't, we are going to be lost and I didn't join the underground because I thought that we would liberate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">I thought I joined the underground mainly because if we going to die, we must be dying fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">I was convinced, just like I was convinced when we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> that we’re not going to make it, but at least I tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">I'd always this feeling, you have to try and you know I'm a little bit always looking back and I said, I don't understand why, when you knew you were going to die, you were lined up near the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , near the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , why didn't you turn around and kill a German? </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">You can't be deader than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">You're going to be dead in half an hour in the oven. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">That was my feeling, and I think when looking back those years, I don't think I was a hero or anything, I just lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">And I was surely going to die and if you're going to die, it's almost like sometimes I feel, somebody asked me what would you do if somebody told you in six months you are going to die, then I would like to know what I'm going to do for the next six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">And I think all this war I had always this feeling, I'm not going to make it, nobody's going to make it, no Jew is going to make it, but we have to make them pay dearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1177">QUESTION:  What do you think about your background and your growing up gave you this edge or this conjecture? </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">That it had made you feel this way, when a lot of people, as you said, were more passive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1179">ANSWER:  I don't know, because I, no, I--maybe yeah--when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , I joined a Zionist organization and it was not the Betar, but 1t was an organization which felt also, don't give an inch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">But I don't think that did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">I don't know, I have the impression it's that feeling that we were a very close family and we used to discuss those things and my father had this attitude, don't trust anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">And he had this, he said, like Einstein, antisemitism is like a shadow, it follows you everywhere, so you better be prepared and when he showed me, you know he always repeated the notion: “No, I'm going to be a Belgian and I'll be an equal,” and when it came out, we started saying--my father came back and smack in his face and he says, “You imagine, a Frenchman hitting me and calling me dirty Jew when we are having this fight against the Germans.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">And the same thing happened again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">I started thinking he was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">And then when I start getting occupied and we heard about all the shrinking of the free world, said, ““We don't want to make it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">Now, how we going to make them pay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">That's, I think it was not my upbringing that made it mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">I think it's the desperation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1189">QUESTION:  When you were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> originally, you were a fairly religious family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">During these war years, did you pay any attention to religion or to holidays, or to anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1191">ANSWER:  Oh, yes--we didn't--no--during the occupation? </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">As a matter of fact my father allowed us--he didn't eat trayf**, he never ate--I mean, he ate meat, but it had to be beef, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">He let us eat anything we wanted, when we could find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">Remember, for a long time we could just eat whatever we found, sometimes dandelions on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1196">QUESTION:  Was religion important to you at all during this period, psychologically? </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">38 Non-Kosher food or drink (Yiddish).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1198">ANSWER:  No, it has never been, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">I'm more religious now than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">No, I think I was rebelling a little bit against my father's religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">I was more ethnically identified. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">I was starting to rebel a lot against religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">I like much more the tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">I was very, when I heard traditional praying, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">I--it was more like I can go to a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> now, I love to go to <span class="BUILDING">cathedrals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">My wife says, “One day you're going to convert because you love so much the <span class="BUILDING">cathedrals</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">I like the liturgy, etcetera, but I wasn't religious then and during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">I went, after the war, through a tremendously anti-religious feeling, because I felt if God had permitted that, it isn't possible that we had the right religion or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">And until this day I can't understand what happened, as far as religion 1s concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1210">QUESTION:  Did you resent being a Jew during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1211">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">That's one thing I felt, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">As a matter of fact, until--it took me a long time and until that day that I was caught by this--and I still say I am Jewish--feeling now I am ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">All I had to say was no, and they would have accepted it, because I had the papers saying Belgian born, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">They didn't know any better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1217">QUESTION:  Another thing I want to ask you about, and it'll just be a couple more minutes, if you had any impressions of some of the underground leaders in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> that you want to share?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1218">ANSWER:  No, I met only Pol, and I met the one that later on became a relative of mine, Jacques. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">I had the impression that they weren't organized well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">That gave me the impression that they took chances, and as a matter of fact, I think Jacques, two weeks or three weeks after he got my--we wanted, we kept--was caught and sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , but I could have said that he would be caught because he looked--he wasn't really acting like somebody who is relaxed, and I had the impression like when they sent us over to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , gave me this thing, 48 hours after you arrive there you have to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barcelona</span> and report to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Secera</span> and then you will meet a fellow by the name of Steinhorn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">Steinhorn didn't even know he was the agent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">And then he gave me another name of somebody--Croustillon--and I remember Croustillon, he didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">He also didn't know he was a liaison and they were both very, very unimpressive people, the ones that I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">But Pol apparently did a nice job, I just didn't know him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">But my impression then is probably wrong, because they did have a good organization, but not when I met him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">See, I was a guinea pig, remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">They had time to organize themselves, to solidify themselves, to polarize; but when I was there it was a fledgling organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1228">QUESTION:  Just trying to get a sense of what kind of people some of those leaders were--but you didn't know them well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1229">ANSWER:  No, he was a, I don't know, he was a very short fellow, a very small fellow, with a heavy Polish accent; and Jacques was a very energetic, very strong, mysterious guy, but he acted mysterious so that you could pick him up and I was very fond of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">He died recently of cancer, but he became one of my dearest friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">There were some people like Maurice J ourdan, Ado, George, they all had it, but I think they were not yet organized.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1232">QUESTION:  Anything else you want to add?</span></p>

[</span><span class="sentence" id="1237">Technical dialogue] You know what, we're going to have to do this--I do want to do this-- do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">I want, I do want him to show, I want to make sure that he can see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">You tell us what they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1240">ANSWER:  That's the certificate of the--this is document attesting my activities and describing it during the war in the organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">I mainly show it, show you the name of the organization which is Jewish--Organization of Combat, which was referred to as OJC. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">This is signed by the--this is not the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , by the commander--whether you, now you can show it--by the commander of the Jewish underground and Toulouse captain Loeb and countersigned by the command, the French command of the army of the <span class="REGION">region</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">The other document, you want to see this one that she has asked me to show you, is my discharge from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Brigade</span> ; and this here is the paper that I received when I was-- that points out that I'm an illegal, that I have entered illegally <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , and this was a paper that was stamped, every single day we have to report to the commander here, see, because we were illegals; and this was after I was discharged from <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , so every week we had to go and have this stamped at the commander; and this here attests that I have entered clandestinely, clandestinely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">It says, “clandestinamente.”*’ </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">This was the paper, it says, “clandestinely entered <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> ”; and then finally, here is a certificate issued to me that I had tried to register--to register at the pre-medical faculty of sciences in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> , but was rejected because I did not meet the Jewish quota of people admitted to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , for racial reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">And that's about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">Conclusion of Interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">° Clandestinely (Spanish). </span>
