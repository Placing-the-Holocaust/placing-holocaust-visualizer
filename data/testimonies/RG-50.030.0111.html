<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  What happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  Uh...At this point, of course,...uh...everybody was very worried, and...uh..my father wanted us to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , but it was too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Somehow, I cannot give you the details, but we didn't get permission and we didn't get permission to go anyplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">My mother tried everywhere, and my father was frantic and he...he suggested that we meet in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Addis Ababa</span> or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Martinque</span> just so that we could be reunited again. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And then finally he got a visa from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> to...uh...<span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and he moved from...to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , hoping that that he would have it easier to have his family follow, but it turned out that the French did not...uh..permit us to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And...uh...uh...so one day...uh...my father just said...In the meantime, the Nazi laws applied to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and...uh...my father recognized the danger, and...uh...said we had...just had to leave at all cost. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And...uh...we...uh...we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden Baden</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that made an excursion into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> , then came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden Baden</span> , and we intended to leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> , but we were very foolish because...uh...we didn't take much but we had one piece of luggage for the three of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And, of course, when we came across the <span class="DLF">border</span> that piece of luggage was...uh...discovered, and...uh...people asked, "Whose <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> is it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And we said, "It's ours," and then they they said, "You...you weren't going to visit the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cathedral of Strasbourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">You were going to come illegally to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and they stamped our passport and sent us back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And...uh...my father said to my mother, you have to try again, and we went to...uh...we went to...uh...uh... Can you cut it off please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  It's okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Let's put it back it on. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">You are about to try again. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Tell me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I...We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saarbrucken</span> and...uh...wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saabricken</span> , and this was already the...the...this was the days of the Munich Acccord, and you could feel the tension in both <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and the...the troops on the frontiers and when we came to the...uh...<span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , there was an SS man and he said, "I know what you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">You want to go illegally to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">You won't make it." </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And my mother said, "Let us try it." </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And he said, "Okay, I'll let you try it, but 1f you come back you will be sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And SO we went over without a visa to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and, of course, we were caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">There were more police in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> than ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And we were caught and we were put into <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , and then we were put back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again and when we arrived the next day it was, I think, at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forbach</span> ....No. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Excuse me....at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saarbrucken</span> , the same SS man was there and he...it was like... He smiled like I told you so. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And then we were put into separate <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and we were... I don't know what happened exactly to my mother and my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I know they were beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I know I was stripped completely and a little...little beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And...uh...then I was...we were released and we were thinking now we are on our way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And I can't explain it but somehow they gave us an opportunity to escape and we ran and we escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And...uh...We found ourselves together again outside the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and...uh...my mother contacted my father in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and he said, "Go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and try to get a visa from the <span class="BUILDING">Consul</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I am going to contact him and I hope he will give you the visa." </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And my mother went to with us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> , but the Consul did not give her a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">He...I wasn't with my mother so I don't know exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We were...uh...waiting for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">When she came back, she was crushed, completely...completely crushed. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">She was a changed person. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">She...At this...by this time, of course, you realize we had been...uh...always in the same clothes and had not changed and...uh...had not had the opportunity to...uh...have any... uh...semblance of human life. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And...uh...she was completely...she dissolved and...and she decided we had to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">This was the only way we could survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And...uh...She went 1n this state in the middle...she didn't want to show it to us, I think, how...how desperate she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And so she went to...to sit on a...a...1n a little <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> in the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and I only know by her story what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I didn't see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Uh...uh...Secretary from the...uh...<span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> arrived and asked her, "Aren't you the lady that wanted the visa?" </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And she said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And he said, "Well, do you have any jewelry?" </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And she said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And he said, "Well, maybe we can do something." </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And so she traded all her jewelry and got three visas, and we were on our way to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> before you could say anything and we...uh...arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and my father was there and I think I'll never forget walking into the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> into freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And...uh...my father took us to a little <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and we...uh...we stayed there...uh...1n the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I remember being very...uh...hungry all the time because we had very little to...money. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">My father had...had no job and...but soon after that, he...uh...managed to make a newspaper, a newsletter, not a newspaper, a newsletter. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">He wrote it all himself, a little bit like the Kiplinger Newsletter, about economic situation in <span class="REGION">Western Europe</span> and...uh...he got people to subscribe to it and he had a...uh...multiplication machine and...uh...he...he sent out his newsletter. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I...I...I did the technical part, the photocopying and making of the newspaper, and we were able to live from his income and soon we had...uh...a little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and...uh...my brother went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and...uh...everything seemed...uh...to pick up except that we were very worried about our family that we had left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">My father...my grandfather....uh...was...because he was a doctor was not allowed to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">He was under strict orders to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and take care of the sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And if he had tried to leave he would have been arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">My other grandmother...uh..lived with...uh...my father's brother and they tried to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and my mother's sister...uh...her husband was actually put into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau concentration camp</span> on... on Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And so we had cause to worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And...uh...1n the end, my family was able to go out of...uh...<span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> in various ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  Tell me...tell me about...a little more about life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Uh...I believe you had someone living with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  Uh...Well, as soon as we had the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ...uh...we tried to help other people who had no <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and...uh...no <span class="NPIP">place</span> because as...when you pass through such...uh...events, you...you feel fortunate when you get a little...a little something already. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And so...uh...my Latin teacher, for instance, who...who left <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ... And she was...she was not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">She was...uh...she was Catholic, but she had a Jewish boyfriend, and was anti-Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And so she wanted to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">She came to our <span class="NPIP">place</span> and stayed with us until she had a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And it's...she had a job offer from a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ...uh...the name of which we had, of course, never heard before, and it turned out that her...she was going to teach German in <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon Feugerolles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And then we had other people sleeping in our <span class="NPIP">place</span> , whoever had no <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  What did you do during this period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Uh...I wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">art school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I always wanted to be an artist. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And so I took an examination to...for an <span class="BUILDING">arts school</span> and prayed that I would be accepted, and I did get accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">It was a question then to...uh...pay because <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> are essentially free. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So it wasn't much. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And...uh...I just...uh...had...uh...some lady helped me with the paying of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So I went to the <span class="BUILDING">art school</span> and...uh...that was...I was very thankful for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I had a wonderful...uh...experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">My brother went to <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  When and how did things begin to change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  It became...it...with the declaration of war between...uh...<span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> on...in...uh...I would like to add too that in the period just before I..I met a young student who, a Czech student, who today is my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And...uh...he...he at this time, he was a student in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and he liked to come to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and discuss politics with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And...uh...when the war was declared, I would...I have to add something that is more general now because our situation in...1n <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was ambiguous for the French because we were Austrians, and Austrians were Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So we were part of the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">On the other hand, they did understand vaguely that anti-Nazis could not really be an enemy, so it was very difficult for them to apply enemy laws to these types of refugees that came to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But...and it depended actually on the individual...how he interpreted the laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So when the...uh...war was declared on September, the 3rd, 1940...No...Excuse me...1939...uh... There immediately, there was a mobilization of the French population and also there was a call for foreign nationals who were non-enemies to...uh...help the French effort to fight the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Now...uh...My father would have joined it, but he was not allowed to join it. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">He was...the Austrian men, my father and my brother, were considered enemy aliens at this point, and they were ordered to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So my brother and my father had to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They were not together. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">My brother was in one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and my father was in another. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">The...the women were left <span class="NPIP">outside</span> so my mother and I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Uh...The Czech student, whose name is Ernest, engaged himself into the Czech army that...the Czech army in exile, and he...we were all wanting to help the war effort to fight the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And also we didn't think it would...uh...the Nazis would win. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I... mean at this point we were convinced we're going to save...uh...the world from Nazism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  What happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  What happened?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  You know that is a good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I hardly know how to answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Uh...My...my mother...uh...my mother had, in her youth when she was about 20 years old...uh...helped my grandfather to take care of the wounded in World War I, so she had a little bit of nursing training. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And...uh...she then went and by word of mouth tried to do some nursing and she got money from ...from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And...uh...1n <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ...[...you...I went...wanted to do babysitting or teaching languages or whatever, but in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ...uh...there isn't no...you don't...do babysitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">At that time, you didn't do babysitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">You were a nurse maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">But you didn't do babysitting in the evenings like you do it in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And I didn't want to give up <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , so...uh... I had just a few occupations, a few times that I could earn money and I tried by all means to do it, but it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">We lived from day to day. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">That's the answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And...uh...as a matter of fact, there's a...there's a very funny story, but I am not going to go into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">You want me to. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Uh...In <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we had...uh...party. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And...uh...I was told, "Oh, Elizabeth comes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Bring us a Viennese cake. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And my mother was able to do it, but we didn't have the money to buy the ingrediences, so how are we going to do this Viennese cake without saying that we don't have the money? </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I don't remember any more how we solved the problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I remember that...uh...I was terribly embarrassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And another story is that...uh...we had a Spanish girl in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and...uh...1n <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , it was...we...there were a lot of Spanish refugees at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And, of course, I felt close to this girl because she was 1n my opinion a co-sufferer, and we got to be very, very good and close friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Her...her name is Maria. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And at one time, Maria invites me to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And...uh...I look at her address and it was the Rond Point des Champs Elyssees and...uh... Okay, I...another thing is I never had enough money for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">metro</span> , so I walked a lot and also later I got myself a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But at this particular point, I...I walked to the <span class="DLF">Rond Point</span> , and when I came to the address it...1t was the <span class="BUILDING">French Embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And...uh...I was very astounded and I rang the bell and the bell...<span class="DLF">door</span> was open and I walk in and in front of me 1s the portrait...of...of Franco, an enormous portrait of Franco, and I got very frightened, but I say, "Okay." </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I walk in and I turn around and upstairs is my little girlfriend, Maria, say, "Come up. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Come up." </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And I walk up, and there's a tremendous portrait of Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And I walk up, and my little girlfriend, Maria, was the daughter of the French...of the Spanish Ambassador. (</span><span class="sentence" id="189">Pause) By the way, he became Ambassador to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">QUESTION:  You were in this limbo for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Did your father come back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> at this point? </span><span class="sentence" id="192">What happened to your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And...uh...meantime, we went visiting my...I went visiting my brother once. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I couldn't visit my father, but he was released from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">My brother was...uh...not released, and he was released from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I don't know why.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  Tell me about the visit to your brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">You have drawn a picture of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">ANSWER:  Well, I...that...that is why I got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I had to...I wanted to visit my brother and...uh...somebody was selling a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and so I figured 1t would be much less if I bought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and go instead of taking the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So I bought this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , which I named Barthalemus, and I went to see my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And I got permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">It was very rare that people got permission to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And I was very happy to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I was very happy to see my brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">QUESTION:  So your brother remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , however? </span><span class="sentence" id="208">He was not released?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">My...my father was released, maybe because of his age? </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I don't really know why.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">QUESTION:  Can you describe his coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">ANSWER:  Oh, it...one day he appeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">It was completely unexpected. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">He appeared and we just...1t was like...like sunshine coming back. (</span><span class="sentence" id="216">Laughter) It was great, and I remember all he wanted is to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> ...uh, read his newspaper, and have a good meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">QUESTION:  When did things change for you yet again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">ANSWER:  And then...uh...he didn't stay long. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">My father didn't stay long because he had to engage himself in to what was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp de Prestataire</span> which was part of the French Army unit actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">It was the same thing as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , only it was called Prestataire, and the other difference is...1s then we got...uh...a little compensation from the French government for his being...uh...engaged so to speak as a Prestataire. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">It was ...uh....1t was not any more a prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">It was...uh...you were engaged in taking part in the war effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">QUESTION:  Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So your father was more or less in this service?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  Uh...When did things begin to get a little worse? </span><span class="sentence" id="227">What...what happened to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">ANSWER:  Uh...Well, things got worse when...uh...things got worse for <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Tell us about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">ANSWER:  Uh...We had...we had...uh...the Germans advanced. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">In the beginning, it was called the Drole de Guerre because nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And then in...in the springtime, the Germans advanced and...uh...the unexpected happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">They weren't...they weren't....they were victorious. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Nobody had imagined that. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">They conquered <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">They conquered <span class="REGION">Northern France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And...uh..we couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">At one point, you could hear the...the cannons and...uh...and...uh...the...the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and everything in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> were dark...of course, darkened, and you could hear the bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And it was frightening, and people started running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Most of the French people had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the...1n <span class="REGION">Southern France</span> somewhere and or grandparents and knew where to go, but people like us didn't know where to go, so we couldn't make any plans, but also we couldn't make any plans because the police did not let us travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And...uh...we were told by our conciege that we should not even think of leaving our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , because she would...uh...notify the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And...uh..so we were under...under observation, and we didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">In the end, when the pressure became so...I mean...by pressure, I mean we realized the Germans are going to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in 2 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Uh...We decided we are going to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And...uh...we didn't know where my brother were...was, and nor where my father was. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Uh...We...we assumed that my father was...uh...somewhere fighting perhaps or in the work camp, and my brother equally and...uh...but we didn't know where they were, and we didn't know where to go and we had no means of going any <span class="NPIP">place</span> except the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">So we decided the following: My mother would go on foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">She would make auto stop, and I would follow her wherever she would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And...uh...so I wouldn't have a...a <span class="NPIP">destination</span> except the destination where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> that would accept her would take her. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">That would be my destiny and our destiny. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And it...we...we didn't imagine the difficulty of carrying out this plan, but we went to the Port d'Orleans in the south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , which was uh...group. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">already filled with people leaving and it's very difficult to even recognize the layout. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And...uh...But quickly I got a...a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I...My mother was too shy to do the auto stopping herself, and...uh...so I did it for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And then I put her into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and then I quickly asked the driver where he was going as he rolled away, and he said, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rambouillet</span> and so I took my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and all I knew is...was my mother was on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rambouillet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And as I bicycled I realized I don't know where in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rambouillet</span> I am going to meet her. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Also there were more than one <span class="DLF">road</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rambouillet</span> , so she could be in the north, or east or west of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rambouillet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Fortunately, by almost a miracle I found her at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rambouillet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I was looking at every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and I can't tell you today how come I found her. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I found her. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">It's not very far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And...uh...We stayed the night there at a very poor <span class="BUILDING">woman's house</span> who was very...uh...uh...to whom we were very thankful for taking us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">We slept at her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the next day, the voyage started all over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">But we had learned to be a little more precise about our <span class="NPIP">destination</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So we said when the...the next person says where he is going, we will meet at the Marie, at the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> of this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , because every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> has a <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So the next time, I...uh...I think it was...we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chauteaudun</span> , and then we met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chauteaudun</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And it was at the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> and again we were very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">We met somebody who offered us...uh...a...a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And the next day, my mother...we went to...oh, I think...no, the next... Excuse me, I...I think I am mixing it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">The next day we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chatres</span> , and there's a... Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And somehow I went much faster than my mother because of the....the <span class="DLF">roads</span> were all clogged with people and...uh...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> could go in and out and the...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> were stuck. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So, I arrived at...uh...Chatres earlier than my mother and...uh...I waited for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And then...as she came, at the moment she came, there was...uh...uh...bombing attack, and we had to run into the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And I remember taking my mother's hand and leaving the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and taking my mother's hand and running into the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And when we came out of the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> 2, 3 hours later, there was two policemen standing next to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and they said, "Is this your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And I said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And they said, "You're a German spy." </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And I said, "I am not a German spy." </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And they said, "What's this?" </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And showed me..in my...I had taken along in my...my musette, I had taken along Ernest's passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I had taken along Goethe's Faust, and I had...and something else that indicated to them that I am...I had some German origins and they arrested my mother and myself and put us in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And...uh...I couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I said, "What...what are you doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I mean I...We're just trying to flee from the Germans, and you say I am a German spy." </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I couldn't believe it, but they didn't listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And...uh...somehow...uh...at 5 o'clock in the morning, they opened the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> and they said, "The Germans are coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">The Germans are coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Run away." </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And I took my mother, and we ran away, literally. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I even found my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , and...uh...then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateaudun</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateaudun</span> , the next day...we...the next day we...we said we are going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blois</span> if possible because we were depending on...we couldn't say at anytime where we wanted to go, only where....where we could go. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Right?
