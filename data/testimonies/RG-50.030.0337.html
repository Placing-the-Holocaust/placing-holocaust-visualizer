<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your family and personal background in terms of -- a <span class="BUILDING">religious home</span> , a politically active <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Well, let's see. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elizabeth</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and it was in 1917. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">We -- it was a combination of <span class="BUILDING">households</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I lost my father at that time, and we were going to move in with my grandfather, and he passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And so we were there along my -- my mother with two children and her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And so we had to get along. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My education was in the New York school system. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I went to <span class="BUILDING">New York University</span> , got a degree in finance, did graduate work in economics. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at night, worked during the daytime, various jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">One job, though, that I took in 1929, I was working in the credit department of a <span class="BUILDING">mercantile firm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Working in the credit department decided me on becoming a credit man. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And so in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I studied credits and collections. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">That was the subject of my major and accounting. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">In 1929, though, I switched over from this particular <span class="BUILDING">firm</span> and went into the banking business. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">As part of my banking training I was going to become a banker and a businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Went into the Manufacturers Trust Company. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I started working for the Manufacturers Company a few days before Black Friday in 1929. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And I guess that probably influenced my career. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Anyhow, I was with the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> until 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">They got looking around to see how things were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Somebody suggested that I see the JDC, Joint Distribution Committee, and they asked me to come in to do a special job that needed doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And in due course I was prevailed upon to give them one year out of my life to do this special job. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">The one year out of my life turned out to be about 60 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">That was a very long agreement. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I worked in the New York headquarters office of the Joint Distribution Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Then until 1939 -- I was there until November. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">How come? </span><span class="sentence" id="28">The war began in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">It became apparent to me as it did to others that circumstances will have changed in Europe, and JDC would need all the help it could over in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I volunteered to go overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I was accepted, and I went overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And I arrived overseas in December 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">My first permanent job, we thought would be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , where I served as the secretary of the European Executive Council of the JDC and did my job there. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">The head of the overseas operations at that time was a man by the name of Morris Troper, T-r-o-p-e-r, who was the director general of the overseas operation of the JDC. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">He was joined by a man by the name of Schwartz, Dr. Joseph Schwartz, who came over to Europe at that time to join Mr. Troper. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Joe Schwartz landed in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , joined Troper, who was going to <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> , who at that time was making a visit around in Europe to make plans with the agencies with which the JDC was cooperating for the event that war would ensue and we would be cut off. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">While they were overseas, war did ensue. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">While they were traveling around in Europe, war did come along. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">That was in June 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">They were traveling around. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">The Germans were practically knocking on the <span class="DLF">door</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I was in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">It was the <span class="BUILDING">European headquarters</span> , I was in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">After making diligent inquiry, I came to the conclusion that the JDC has to move its <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">It couldn't remain there. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Having arranged with other Jewish organizations working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> at the time, like ORT-HIAS, the French-Jewish organizations and so on, none of us would move without advising the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I came to the conclusion on a Sunday that we were going to move out, having consulted with the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> , who at that time were following up the French, who were making up their minds as to whether they wanted to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> or not and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Decided to close up the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and to move out. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">That was on Monday -- it's Monday -- that was on Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I guess that was on June the 8th or -- if that was a Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Anyhow, that Sunday around June, decided to close the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Closed the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , moved -- intended originally to move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tours</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Couldn't go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tours</span> because the French government had decided that they were going to evacuate from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tours</span> , and they occupied the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to such an extent that nobody else would be permitted to come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">In that same Sunday, when we decided to close the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , I had to phone the staff to ask them to come into Monday, prepare to travel out, we're leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">They came in Monday to leave the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> with their baggage and so on, and they went over to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I came there when I -- as I began to say, in that Sunday I phoned around to tell the other agencies we decided to move to discover that they had already left without telling us. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And the JDC was the only Jewish organization, welfare organization, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , all by ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Well, Dr. Schwartz and Mr. Troper came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> on Monday. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">The rest of the staff had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I had kept the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> open. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">There were just one -- two secretaries, myself and -- no, three secretaries, myself and then the two gentlemen who came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">We closed down the -- closed down the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> on Tuesday, and the Germans came in on Thursday. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">As I said, we've started out for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tours</span> , we couldn't get in, had to change directions. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">We ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">We moved the <span class="BUILDING">JDC headquarters</span> over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> 
QUESTION:  Can I interrupt you here. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I have a question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  You were in Europe already when there had been quite a build up, and the war certainly had started --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  -- in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">What was the mood? </span><span class="sentence" id="71">What did you think was going to happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  The mood in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was very confusing at the time, because when you walked down the Champs Elysees, you had the impression there was absolutely nothing going on, everything looked normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And you couldn't tell by looking around the <span class="DLF">streets</span> that anything was happening at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And I think that up to that point the French had the feeling that their army was invincible, and they were going to stop off the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Well, it was misplaced, as you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So that -- we ended up, then, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We moved the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We sent out the cables to all the agencies in Europe with which we had been operating to tell them where our new <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> , to discover later on that the center had held up the cables, and none of them had gone out. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">They were held up by the center, by the military people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> (ph) for about four or five days. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Government in the meantime had moved down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">The Germans knew that, and threatened to bomb the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">As a matter of fact, they did drop a couple of bombs around the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> to let the French know that they're still around. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And the French, then, had sat down and said, "Anybody who wants to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> , must leave by midnight of a certain day or you can't get out." </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Troper, the couple of secretaries and I, Schwartz (ph), we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">We decided to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">We made the midnight deadline, slept out in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , just to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">As a matter of fact, the <span class="DLF">road</span> were so crowded at that time with refugees -- who were coming down from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and from <span class="REGION">Northern France</span> going down to <span class="REGION">Southern France</span> -- that the automobile trip that normally took seven hours from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> , it took us three days to get down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">The <span class="DLF">roads</span> were that crowded with refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And we had hardships along the <span class="DLF">road</span> too, ran out of gasoline and shelter and all that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So we decided then to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We did that and headed for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> and decided that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> was the furthest west one could go in Europe to still be in <span class="REGION">European territory</span> , and that's the place to have the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">That was all right because the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was not yet in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">This was in -- when we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> , that was in June, July 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So we didn't go to the war until December [1941], so it was all right for us to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> , and that's where we were going to make our new <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> after the armistice to see whether there was any work that the JDC could do with the French-Jewish population, especially -- particularly the refugees, who were coming down there from the north and from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Decided that there was work that the JDC could do, and I opened up the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> for the JDC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> for unoccupied <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  I want to backtrack a minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  Because I have a lot of questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">In 1939 and 1940 before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was occupied --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  Where were your efforts directed? </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Where were the JDC -- were you sending money into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or --
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Starting with 1933 with the advent of Hitler, we did not send any money into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">We had worked out an arrangement with the German Rifentrajung (ph) and the German Hoopsverine (ph), which were the agencies in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with which we worked, whereby they would collect to the extent that they could the cost of passage for people immigrating to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">They would collect them in Marks, and we would buy their steamship tickets for the dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Consequently our dollars did not go into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but the counter-value of local currency, which was already in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , was made available to the agency with which we operated. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So if you ask if we sent money in, we did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We operated that kind of a transaction. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And when <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was over-- <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was the anschluss, we did the same thing with <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And in due course we even worked out by financial ledgerdomain to get money into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">We didn't send money into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  You went over with this purpose?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  No, I went over for the -- I didn't go over as a financier. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I went over as a -- as a generalist, who happened to know something about finance, but that isn't why I went over. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I went over, as I say, as a generalist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  Is that what --
ANSWER:  You ask what did we do out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> , since we were not in the war, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> was neutral, we could still communicate with any of the agencies with which we had formally been in contact with, by phone or mail or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">But of course, by mail we would not have tried to get in touch -- or any other way -- with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because anything that a name like Jewish, who would have been -- tripped us___—_—sain <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and it wouldn't have gone through anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And the same thing with <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But with the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> we could still work. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">There weren't many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> left where the Germans -- of course they occupied everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So that while we were at liberty to do it, we were rather restricted in what we could do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Now, being that you were in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  You, I assume, had a lot more information about what was already happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> than the people back in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  The curious thing is this: People thought that since I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> -- back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> in 1943 -- that we knew all about what was going on with the stories that were coming out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , which later became known. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We did not -- I did not know that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">We didn't have that information. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">The information that was coming out on that was being sent out by Riegner from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , and it got over to the State Department through the help of the American Mission in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And they suppressed it, because they said they wanted proof that the stories that were coming out were accurate, and they were going to hold up the information until they got that proof. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Well, as you know, it took months before the story finally was released what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> , we didn't know it, because the Portuguese papers certainly didn't carry it. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">They didn't know it either. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">They had no reporters running around loose, going into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So we didn't know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And only Riegner's reports brought the information out, and they were suppressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So the information wasn't generally known. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So we worked then. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">We stayed in contact, which was all right until December 1941, when -- everything got stopped off when we entered the war, and then we were fighting with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and with <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and the Italians came in in June 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And so we couldn't communicate with them and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We had to find other ways then for remaining in contact and communicating with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We got in touch with a man in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">You may have heard his name, Soudymiah (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="146">His name keeps coming up. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">He lived in up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Gallen</span> in <span class="REGION">North Switzerland</span> , who was president of the central Swiss welfare, Jewish welfare organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And he agreed temporarily to act for the JDC in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">He finally gave up that position with the Swiss agency in order to devote all his time to JDC. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So he became JDC's representative in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And it turned out that he was our delegate for all these <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> which the JDC itself as an American organization could not come in contact, which meant that he was in contact with <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , with <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , and even with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , with <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , occupied, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And he did the things for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Communication with Soudymiah was easy enough by telephone. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> you could talk back and forth -- you could talk to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">That was all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">You just had to be careful about routing the telephone calls, because if they crossed -- going to cross <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , that was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Do it by ____; they were more liberal. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And you could make your telephone calls that way, and even send mail that way in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So that's how we kept in touch, then, with the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> with which the JDC -- which the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ultimately was in war with.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  When you were in <span class="REGION">Southern France</span> in, I guess, 1939, 1940?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  I went there --
QUESTION:  Were the refugees there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  Yeah, sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  What was that operation about? </span><span class="sentence" id="164">What did you do there? </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Tell me more about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  Working out of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , that was strictly for <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">The refugees who had been up in the <span class="REGION">northern part</span> -- it turned out to be the German-occupied area -- to the extent that they could, they came down to the <span class="REGION">southern part</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Who were they? </span><span class="sentence" id="169">The ex-Germans and the ex-Austrians and the ex- other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> with which the Germans -- the Germans were at war -- so they came down south. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">The Belgians came down south, so there were plenty of refugees in the unoccupied zone. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Also came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> the agencies with which we had been working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">They were evacuated the same as we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">They ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">The <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> with which we worked, they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">The Ose -- you may have heard about them -- O-s-e. That's . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">They were down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">The agencies with which the JDC had operated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> were over in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> , so we just resumed contact with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And we knew how they operated, they knew how we operated. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">We were back in business again --
QUESTION:  So what were you able to do down there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">The assistance which was given in the unoccupied zone was mainly a cash relief assistance program, because it was still possible for people to buy things in the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And their big problem was that they had no jobs, and what they needed was some money with which to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And the JDC provided that. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">The OSE was a medical assistance organization, and they cared for children. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">So they did their job. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">They had misunderatret (ph) -- installations where children, unaccompanied children were. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And they had a medical program. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">The HIAS (Hebrew Immigration and Sheltering) -- what the HIAS -- you know what the HIAS -- you know that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">What I know is that's sort of a few.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">ANSWER:  We just had to provide -- we just had to -- we provided them with funds so that they could continue operating in these various <span class="DLF">fields</span> which I have just described to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And we worked with welfare organizations too. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">There was a Jewish welfare organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyons</span> , which was pretty large. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And the other thing that we did out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> was to continue sending assistance up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Of course we had left behind in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> there some Jewish people who remained up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and kept the organizations going and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And there was a woman who was active in the International Social Service, a non-Jewish lady who used to travel back and forth between the two <span class="REGION">zones</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And we would give her a sum of money, and she would take it up with her back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And she would bring back the reports from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> so that we knew what was going on up there at least and could follow up on their <span class="BUILDING">household</span> and financing arrangements and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And so that's how we kept in touch with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And so out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> we were able to keep things on some kind of a fairly even keel in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">That went along reasonable all right until November 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">In November 1942, the Germans came down and occupied the unoccupied zone and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And then things became a little bit topsy-turvy, because the Jewish refugees, they had no particular resource to which they could turn back on. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> became peripatetic, because they couldn't afford being around with the Germans and ___ looking for Jewish people and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">So it became peripatetic and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">But the work continued, and during the whole war period the JDC programs continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Of course there was problems connected with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">It didn't necessarily work smoothly, but to the extent possible, continued in both <span class="REGION">zones</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">QUESTION:  Did you get at all involved with the French-Jewish resistance? </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Did you give them any kind of assistance?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">ANSWER:  When I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- when I left <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , I came on home leave -- I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> in the end of September, I think, or beginning of October of 1941 for some home leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And I was on my way back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> when we entered the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">My assistant, who remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> , who was French, he took over then, when I couldn't go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">It subsequently developed that this assistant was active in the Jewish Army of Resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">We didn't know it at the time -- extracurricular activity. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And we didn't know that until he left <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and came down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barcelona</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So that if you ask were we in contact with the resistance, sure, we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">As a matter of fact one of the things that we financed in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was the -- we helped the local organization -- we didn't do it ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">We didn't work in our own name in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">We worked through local organizations, which as you know is a matter of policy of the JDC. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">We worked through local organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And one of the organizations with which we worked had a business of providing false documents through Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">As a matter of fact, I'm told -- I didn't know this until later -- I'm told that these things were printed at the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of the . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">But they worked with our money.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">QUESTION:  You worked with organizations, were they Jewish organizations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  Jewish organizations, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">They worked with our money. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Most of the <span class="BUILDING">agencies</span> , Jewish agencies, in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> were working with our money. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">We might not have had our own personnel there, but -- you see, one of the advantages that JDC has -- we have been in business for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">We started in 1914 with this first shipment to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">We learned something from the first war. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And the first war was that we should do things in our own name, but to work through indigenous organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Because if we do things in our own name with our own personnel, the day we pull out -- and we thought we were temporary -- the day we pull out would be the day the agency would collapse. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">The work would collapse. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So we developed local organizations 1n all the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in which we operate, and we always worked through them. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And our advantages that we had that when the JDC was not present, they knew enough about what the JDC -- how it operated and what its desires were and so on that they were able to function __—_—r without our actually being there, but they carried on. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And that's what kept the JDC going. "</span><span class="sentence" id="238">JDC" quote, unquote had all of these <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in Europe from which the JDC had no direct contact, but they knew enough about what they had learned from us, which we had learned after the first World War to keep on going. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And there was always some embryonic JDC around in the countries of Europe that keep things going. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And so that's how the work continued in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> for the refugees and kept on that way, I guess, in 1944, when our <span class="BUILDING">Paris office</span> was reopened, when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">We went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> again on the same <span class="REGION">premises</span> which we had, which we had closed up in June 1940, went right back into the same <span class="REGION">premises</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">QUESTION:  Now, you took a little bit of a detour before going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">ANSWER:  When did I go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">QUESTION:  Didn't you go for a while to the War Refugee Board?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Well, I went back --
QUESTION:  Or that was afterwards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I'll tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So I went on <span class="BUILDING">home</span> leave, as I told you, in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I was on my way back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> when we went into the war, and we were -- there was so -- little uncertainty that the Germans were coming down into <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> that our <span class="BUILDING">New York office</span> sent their message over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> , all the Americans had come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">So I landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> on Monday, and on Friday I was on back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And it took me a good couple of months before I could have permission to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> there until the end of 1943, when I entered the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But my military service was on Detached Service as a special attache (ph) to the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ankara</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , which I did as an army man. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And that was for the War Refugee Board, when I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256"><span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> was an <span class="REGION">area</span> through which there could have been -- and to a certain extent there was -- movement of refugees to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">The people who were coming out from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> would come out via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Varna</span> , which is in <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> or via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Constanta</span> , which is in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">They would come out by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> down through the <span class="REGION">Black Sea</span> as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> and then over <span class="REGION">land</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I was attached to the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ankara</span> , but I was stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> for the War Refugee Board. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And that was part of my job in connection with this movement going through. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">The work for the refugees in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> was divided in three ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">There were three agencies involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">The Jewish agency was there to control -- to have something to say about people going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and issuing certificates for that purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">There was another group of individuals from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> representing the different political parties __—_ that the Mossad- you probably have heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">The Mossad spoken about, they were the Mossad. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">They were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So you had the Jewish agency doing the technical work. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">You had the Mossad organizing these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">The JDC was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">They did the financial work. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">The War Refugee Board did the political work. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">What was their political work? </span><span class="sentence" id="273">The Turks would not give transit visas to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">In order to get through to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , you had to go via <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275"><span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> wouldn't let them through. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Why wouldn't they let them through? </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Because the British wouldn't let them into <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So there had to be discussions and negotiations and one thing or another with the British and with the Turks. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">That was War Refugee Board business. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And finally the Turks agreed to give a transit visa to any refugee who could put his foot on <span class="REGION">Turkish soil</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">So the job was to get the people to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So they got them to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">They came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ubea</span> (ph), which 1s an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> off <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">They came across, and they landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ismea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">They came by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Constanta</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Varna</span> through the Black Sea to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> , and a couple of transports even came through by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And since they got their foot on Turkey soil, they got transit visas -- the <span class="NPIP">place</span> agreed to let them in, and so they -- I don't know, about 9,000, 10,000, something like that -- got into <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> that way through the -- it was an effort of the War Refugee Board and the political angle. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">When I finished with the job in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> -- because you remember <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> turned around in 1944 and entered the war on our side -- they didn't need the War Refugee Board anymore in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And I was reassigned to the mission in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berne</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> for the War Refugee Board. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I was stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">What was my job there for the War Refugee Board? </span><span class="sentence" id="291">There was a group of Hungarians -- I don't know, about three or four hundred Hungarians -- who were admitted under certain circumstances, permitted to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And we tried to prevail upon the Swiss to let them come in to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> instead of sitting up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And we gave the Swiss a guarantee that at the earliest moment, if they would let these people into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , we will evacuate them. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So we worked that one out, and they had these three or four hundred people came down from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , and they landed in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And then it was my job to get them out of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and I had to do that through the army and field telephones, all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Anyhow, they got out of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">QUESTION:  When you say "got them out," can you tell me a little bit more about how you did that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">For instance, when we got them out -- the army controlled the transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Anything that moved -- that involved transportation had to do through the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So I would go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , where there was an army host on their field telephone, to get through via the field telephone from Annacey through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyons</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyons</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , to talk to the transport people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">The transport people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">They moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rehon</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="304">That's where the treaty was signed, the peace was signed. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">So then another operation I had to go through to get through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyons</span> -- after the armistice, they moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they ended up in the Archifaven (ph) building in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , had to get through to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">All this by telephone, the field telephone and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Anyhow, that's how I got them out, by working it out with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army transport</span> that they would take them, because they had to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> through the Mediterranean -- by <span class="REGION">land</span> you could get them to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">They went down by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> -- <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , but they didn't control the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> , you had to do that through the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">So that's how they -- how this particular group was moved out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">QUESTION:  What time period are talking about here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER: <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ"> Swiss trains</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">QUESTION:  What time period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">ANSWER:  This was in 19 -- 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I would say about July or August 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">QUESTION:  So I just want to ask you questions for my own clarity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">QUESTION:  You started with the War Refugee Board --
ANSWER:  Yeah, then when the war was over, I got out of the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">When I got out of the army, that released me from the War Refugee Board. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">So that ended up the War Refugee Board job, which I told you started in February 1944, and it landed until I got out of the army in October 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">That finished me with the War Refugee Board, that finished me with the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I went back to the JDC. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I went back overseas again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="324">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Back to the War Refugee Board. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">How large of an operation was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">ANSWER:  What with the War Refugee Boards? </span><span class="sentence" id="328">We had -- there were exactly four people in this dembo (ph) in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">It was Ira Hirschman (ph), who was the chief of mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">There was myself, two secretaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">That was the whole War Refugee Board in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And we worked through everybody else, through the Jewish agency, with the Joint (ph), everybody we worked through. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">But that was our job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  Did you work with other U.S. organizations like the State Department or the OSS or --
ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">The War Refugee Board consisted of three people with the secretaries, the treasury, which was Morgenthau. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">There was Secretary Stimson. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I think he was war. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And I think Hull was Secretary of State. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Anyhow, there were three Secretaries of State with the War Refugee Board responsible directly to the President. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">So we were in that <span class="DLF">channel</span> with the War Refugee Board. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">That was our contact, that was the backing that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And then in consequence of that, we were practically unique, because we had permission to deal with the enemy that was going to be of any way to help the refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">So we were entitled -- normally American citizens could do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">We were authorized to deal with the enemy in order to do what we had to do to rescue people. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">The War Refugee Board, they had a representative in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">That was Iva Olsen (ph), who had worked out the deal with Raul Wallenberg, who ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">You've heard of Raul Wallenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">The War Refugee Board had a representative in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> , they had one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">That was about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">QUESTION:  Did you --
ANSWER:  We did the work -- what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  Did you have the support you needed from the State Department in war --

QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">But you need to tell me about this, because people may not have seen the other parts of these interviews. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">So I need you to tell me when we're talking about, when you ended up going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and how you got up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erolson</span> and when that was -- just very briefly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">ANSWER:  Well, I got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in December 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">I would like to make a break to tell you something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">In 1943 when I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> , after a great deal of effort the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> finally agreed to accept 5,000 -- 5,000, it was 10,000 -- Jewish refugee children in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> for safekeeping during the war, the same way as they had permitted the English to come over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">You remember when the English came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">They agreed to take them into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And one of the things I was supposed to do when I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> was do some work with this project. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I went back with another JDC member, the name is Soeboe (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And there was an American agency involved in that, German-Jewish Children Agency, I think it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">So then we went up to -- the effort was made with the French to give exit permits to the people to leave <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> who had come out from the unoccupied zone, leave <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> -- former unoccupied zone. </span><span class="sentence" id="387"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Laval</span> refused it. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Laval</span> wouldn't let them out, and so the thing fell through. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">So they couldn't get the kids out. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And the kids that we did bring out were kids who were already out, either in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> or those children who with their parents were smuggled over the <span class="DLF">border</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , so acquired a couple of kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Instead of having the 5,000, we only got about 2-, 300. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">That's all, because Laval put his foot down on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">So that's one effort we made with the refugee -- to help refugees, and discovered then it didn't pan out. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">So then I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , then, and took over there from Jake Trobe (ph) in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And in order to get back into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- they ran a very tight operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">The army, of course, was responsible; the American army for the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> , the British army for the <span class="REGION">British zone</span> , et cetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And they were responsible for everything that went on in their particular <span class="REGION">zones</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Responsibility for the American army in the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> , keep peace and quiet and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And while technically they were responsible for the welfare of the people in the <span class="REGION">zone</span> which they occupied, they said in effect, "We're soldiers, we're not welfare workers." </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And they gave the job to the <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> as a subcontractor, so to speak, to provide care for the refugees and the displaced persons who were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">QUESTION:  I'm sorry to interrupt you, but you went back, then, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in November '45?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  Yeah, I went in November -- December '45, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I left in November, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And then went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> for a couple of weeks, and then were sent up to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to take over from Jake Trobe (ph), who was reassigned. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">How do you get into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Army had subcontracted to <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> to provide basic care and maintenance for the refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">The JDC was -- in order to get in, we had to come in under the umbrella, then, of <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> ’s <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> at that time were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Herxt</span> (ph), which is outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="410">A couple of weeks after I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Herxt</span> (ph) then, UNRRA’s entire headquarters operation was sent up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erolson</span> (ph) and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Since I was at <span class="BUILDING">JDC headquarters</span> -- and at <span class="BUILDING">JDC headquarters</span> , I was attached to <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> ’s <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> -- the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> had to move up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erolson</span> (ph) too, so that the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> for the operation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erolson</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="412"><span class="BUILDING">Headquarters</span> for the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413"><span class="BUILDING">Headquarters</span> for the <span class="REGION">British zone</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and the <span class="REGION">French zone</span> was in -- oh, shoot -- I forget the name -- around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Constance</span> someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I don't remember the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Anyhow, and so the work that I did in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was to travel around the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> to try to things going along smoothly. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">The JDC -- I mentioned this before, I guess -- ran a rather decentralized operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">The JDC proceeded on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> to trust the men in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , where the men were sent out to the <span class="DLF">field</span> and certainly given the responsibility for maintaining a country-wide operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">He was carefully selected, because he had to make decisions on the spot, couldn't go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> every time. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">He had to make a decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Times were changing too quickly, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> couldn't know the local conditions as well as the men on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">He had to make the arrangements. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So I traveled around the various <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> , try to keep in touch, if I could help them with some kind of guidance, you know, how their programs were going and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And I did that for about a year, when we decided to decentralize further. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Hence, having a <span class="BUILDING">central office</span> for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , we had the <span class="REGION">zones</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> ; report directly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And we eliminated the overall <span class="BUILDING">office</span> for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="427"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I think, at that time headed into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And that was an operation which we did for the refugees, for the displaced persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And did our work, whatever it was, to feed the people, to clothe the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Actually, the <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> , they had the responsibility, then, for the basic feeding of these people, which the army had subcontracted to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">But that was the limit of their responsibility, to keep the people alive, to give them some medical help, to give them shelter, give them some clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">But there was a plethora of assistance, which the people required, which <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> didn't give them. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">There were questions of education and entertainment -- good Lord, anything that you could think of, <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> didn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">In addition to that, the food rations, which the refugees got -- the displaced persons got -- was so very low, and the diets were so monotonous and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">So the JDC, to put it very crudely, put the fringe on the embroidery. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">We provided all these extra amenities that were supposed to make life more bearable for these people, which were terms of educations and lectures. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And we had traveling entertainers and legal aid and everything that was required __..._It wasn't a job, we had to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">So that was the JDC's job for all these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">That included immigration assistance too. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">How did we get into the immigration business? </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I was on the telephone up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erolson</span> (ph), and I got a telephone call from Dr. Schwartz, who was the head of the whole overseas operation -- telephoned the -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to ask me to get in touch with our representatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> , that she should help a certain woman to immigrate -- some problem and some papers or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And so I said to Dr. Schwartz, "Why come to us? </span><span class="sentence" id="443">We're not in the immigration business." </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And Dr. Schwartz said to me yes, we are, beginning now. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And that was of the immigration business.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">QUESTION:  Now, was that in '46?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">ANSWER:  That was in '46. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">We had been in the immigration business before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">When we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> , there was these people who were coming down from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Now, the HIAS was operating in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> too at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">But the HIAS, they operated with individual cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">If a relative in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kenosha</span> , <span class="REGION">Wisconsin</span> came to them and said I have a relative, so and so, can you help them get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And the HIAS would say give us the money for the transportation, et cetera, et cetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And then they would work on the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">We couldn't afford that luxury. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">We were in the wholesale business, because as I explained to you before, the Hoofsverine (ph) and the Rifeserine (ph) and so on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> sent all their cases down to us, because we were paying their transportation as I explained. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So consequently, we would have to buy all the passages on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> in order to make room for these people who were coming down. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So while the HIAS, they were in the retail business, we were in the wholesale business. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">But we were in the wholesale business because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> was the only <span class="DLF">port</span> in Europe for which people could sail. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">All the other <span class="DLF">ports</span> were occupied by the Germans -- or I take that back. </span><span class="sentence" id="461"><span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> had some <span class="DLF">ports</span> too that were open. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> was the main <span class="DLF">port</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">ANSWER:  To characterize the work that we do, we do everything from prenatal care to care for the aged. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">We don't quite bury them, but everything in between we do, with the prenatal care and postnatal care, <span class="BUILDING">kindergartens</span> , educations -- public level education. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Ted mentioned to you about the scholarship for the university students. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">The work that we're doing now in addition to care for the aged -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , for example, we have training programs for principals of the ministries and municipalities to try to give them some notions as to how they might improve the services that they give.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">QUESTION:  But back -- actually, I really need to focus a little bit back on the postwar years in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Well, with the -- well, that was about the work that could be done in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from the cradle to the <span class="DLF">grave</span> , but you know, the people who survived what they had gone through, I think that there was a principle of natural selection that was involved, and the people who came through, managed to come through. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">So that what we had to do did not have to be ground down so finely. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">The broader, simpler things we didn't have to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So many of the things that we would do in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , as I say -- like <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> which is much further advanced. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">So that's what we did in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , was supply -- we had this big supply program going --

<p><span class="sentence" id="487">ANSWER:  With the supply program, what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">We had a representative up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">We had a representative up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> and another one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And at least one could buy food and other things in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , which were not available on the = —.~ And so we bought food up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">We bought dairy products in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> and whatever, and we loaded <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and sent them down through. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Some stopped off in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Others went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">They went over as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bublee</span> (ph) with the food stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">They went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krogg</span> (ph), and we left food, which we had acquired in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">When the <span class="DLF">supply line</span> from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> wasn't open, we had to be content with what we could get up in the <span class="REGION">Scandinavian countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And that went along all right, excepting that there wasn't enough of it, but we couldn't give anymore than we got in, than we could acquire and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">What else did we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="499">For the <span class="REGION">education side</span> we had to print our own books. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">We had an education -- he was principal of a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> up in, I think, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newton</span> , <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">He was principal of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">He to come over to the JDC to go overseas as our education guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">So he was traveling around in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , stopped at one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , spoke to one of the ladies who was trying to do some educational work, a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And she told him what a problem she was having. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">She didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">blackboard</span> , she didn't have any chalk, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">What did he do about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Where was he going to find a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">blackboard</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="508">He remembered that down the <span class="DLF">road</span> a piece, he had passed a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , which had been evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And all the shades were in the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">He took these green shades down, gave them to the woman, which she used for blackboards. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And he went around to a supply guy in the PX and got chalk, and she was back in business, and she was able to teach. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Well, we had to have people who could use their ingenuity in that way to make things out of nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">So it was that sort of educational work that had to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Oh, there were all sorts of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">There was the big election in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ufumbah</span> (ph), where the Germans had stored stuff, which had been looted from the private people, from <span class="BUILDING">Jewish libraries</span> and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">It was all in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And the job was -- not doing any good there, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">So arrangements had to be made for moving the stuff out and distributing -- stuff which was in the Ufumbah (ph) __—_— deposit. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Those are things that came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">They were very helpful to people whom we were trying to serve and what contributions which the JDC could make to welfare in general.</span></p>

class="sentence" id="539">And you may know, in the Jewish religion you don't have to be ordained to conduct a service. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">A lay person can do that too. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And so that was done in many of the <span class="NPIP">places</span> where there -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , where they needed a quasi-religious functionary to run the services. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">But the JDC provided funds. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">You probably heard a story from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tetfear</span> (ph) about a mikvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">There was a question of a mikvah, which came up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vohrenwald</span> , which was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="545">A very well known, world known, Jewish rabbi ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fohrenwald</span> , and he insisted on having a mikvah in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vohrenwald</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">There was one, but it wasn't kosher enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">He wanted to make his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So finally a mikvah was built for him by the JDC, but then there was the question of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">You know the water has to be rain water, pure -- it's all described in the Talmud about the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">There was no such water. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">JDC staff member in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vohrenwald</span> , he went up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and brought back a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> full of snow and melted the snow, and the snow was pure, that was fit for the mikvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">So the rabbi had his mikvah and the water, because our guy went up into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and brought snow back, but it was pure water. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">You had to do that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And then in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> themselves there was a business -- we had to start <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">We imported staff from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to do that sort of thing with Sunday school classes and do things for adults, who might have forgotten about their Jewish backgrounds and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">We didn't get very much money for the rebuilding of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">We felt that that was a responsibility of other people to do, and we weren't so anxious to put funds into bricks and mortar when people didn't have [enough] to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">You couldn't feed them bricks and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And so we didn't do too much of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">But where something was mobile, anything that a person could carry with them, that, we were interested in doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Health, they could carry with them; education, they could carry with them; vocational training, he could carry with them -- good for the JDC. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">But we didn't involve ourselves particularly in the rehabilitating of the <span class="DLF">graveyards</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="564">You can't take that with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And while it may have a great deal of religious significance, other people could do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Family members or people from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or something could do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">We had other things to do with our funds. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And so then I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , then, for a year with our program there. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Then I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and undertook other functions there. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">For awhile I filled in a blank in the immigration department of the JDC. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">The immigration, that was really a tough business, because -- as you have heard -- everybody wanted to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And you had people in <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> ; <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">They were all to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to wait in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> until they could get their visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And you know the difficulties which existed in getting visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Nobody would let people in. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Even to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , visas were issued in the order of priority of your registration. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And according to priorities in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , you could have waited for eight years or ten years before you had ____, because it was all done on a quota basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">So everybody wanted to come down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="579"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> got all clogged up with refugees who were sitting around. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Of course, we had to maintain them. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">What were they going to live on? </span><span class="sentence" id="582">We had to maintain them while there were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And so we had to arrange for them to be held back in the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> from whence they came and sent messages back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> not to let people come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> until they are called forward by us. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Called forward meant that there's transportation, there's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">At that time the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> were all clogged up. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger boats</span> going between Europe and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">When I say "no," sure, there were -- every once in a while there would be a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And there was a great deal of competition to get on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">So there were so many <span class="NPIP">places</span> that we could get. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">So we had to tell people -- keep them back where they are, keep them out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , because the authorities in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> were after us, to keep the influx down. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And so they had to stay back. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">On one occasion we had to take a whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , the Shohan Newbit (ph), to send that to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">There were so many Australian visa holders that we had to put them all on one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and send the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> down to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> to get them down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And so we were in the immigration business starting -- as I told you -- until 1954. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And in 1954, a couple of the agencies that were involved with immigration merged, which included the JDC too. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">So that took us out of the immigration business and this merged organization, of which the JDC was the principal anyhow -- at least took it out of our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and took the responsibility away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Another operation that we had was the American Joint Reconstruction Foundation. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">The foundation was established during the wars to help in the establishment of moon (ph) cooperatives for poor people -- or people who couldn't go to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599"><span class="BUILDING">Banks</span> wouldn't necessarily lend to Jews or the interest rates were so exorbitant. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">So we provided capital, got the local people to provide capital, and these <span class="BUILDING">cooperative banks</span> were established by the American Joint Reconstruction Foundation, which were all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , all over <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> , had these foundations. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And then of course, there were people who couldn't even pay the low interest rate that was being charged by these <span class="BUILDING">local banks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">So we opened up free loan societies and provided the capital for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">As I said before, anything that you touched, the JDC was in there somehow or other in trying to make life more livable, to bring people back to normal as quickly as possible and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">QUESTION:  Was the primary goal to bring people back to normal, to sustain them or to get them moved out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="606">QUESTION:  Which was the primary focus if there is one?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">ANSWER:  That's a difficult one. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I think it was more important to move people out, because they could be brought back to normal in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to which they were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And I would say if one had to make a choice, whether you bring people back to normal or move them out, move them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Although it was difficult to move them out if they weren't normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">So which comes first, the chicken or the egg? </span><span class="sentence" id="612">It's a difficult one to work on, but it was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">QUESTION:  When you arrived, when you were Erolson (ph) --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">QUESTION:  -- overseeing that, did the situation you found yourself in, in terms of the numbers of refugees, numbers of people with great needs, did the situation seem overwhelming?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">ANSWER:  I don't think that's a good term to use. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">We knew that we had a big job. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">If you're overwhelmed, you stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">We had a big job, but maybe the job got bigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And you had to do it, but you couldn't be overwhelmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Maybe you were underwhelmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">You certainly couldn't be overwhelmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">The job might have been considered overwhelming. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I think there's a nuance between the job being overwhelming and being overwhelmed by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="625">We weren't overwhelmed --
QUESTION:  But the job was --
ANSWER:  But the job was overwhelming.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">QUESTION:  Can you describe that a bit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">ANSWER:  Look, the JDC had a job to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And there wasn't any question of weighing things, can we do it or can't we do it, do we have staff or don't we have staff, do we need that or don't we need that, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">You just dug in and did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Now, that sounds very simple, but to use a vernacular, we surrounded ourselves with a group of "can do" people, and they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">We had to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">There was no choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">QUESTION:  Was the situation something more than you had ever encountered before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">ANSWER:  Of course I'd never encountered it before. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Nobody had encountered in before. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">This was the first time in history that you had a problem like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">You certainly didn't learn how to handle it in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">You certainly didn't learn it in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> of social work when the people were social workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">You talk with a social worker and you say listen, did your social work help? </span><span class="sentence" id="640">They say it did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">But again, we had people who were working for us who didn't come out of the <span class="DLF">social work field</span> at all; teachers, for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">We had -- the man who ran our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> -- you know about the Cyprus business -- he was a school teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">He wasn't a social worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">But he had social instincts. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">So we knew what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">We didn't have the formal training, but he knew what to do, social work. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">People were the way they were -- their characteristics.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="648">QUESTION:  Do --
ANSWER:  Well, I wonder whether I can take a time out to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">men's room</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">ANSWER:  Where was this Joint successful? </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I would say this: I think you have to look at it a little bit in terms of the times. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">What had happened to the Jewish people in Europe was really so horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">As you think about it, it's incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">You can't even talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">How do you kill billions of people just like that? </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And I think that stirred up a lot of the younger people and some of the older people too, who want to do something to try to -- not make amends, because we didn't do it -- but to try to do something to relieve their plight of people involved a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And they were willing to put in their time and their energies to do something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">You had to have certain characteristics of the individual, I think, to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">It had to be people who were interested in doing things for other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And when these stories got out as to what had happened, a decent feeling, decent thinking young guy would really want to do something to try to help straighten the world out a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And so they were willing to devote part of their time at least to making a contribution to bettering the lot of some people at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And _—_s concerns on trying that outlet in the JDC and going overseas and doing something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And I think that probably motivated many people who came overseas to work with us, and I think that that accounts for the quality and level of work which they produced for JDC and contributed to our success. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And I think that the JDC could feel some satisfaction that it really did contribute something to Jewish life. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Whether it's the fellow who landed back on his feet in Europe or immigrated overseas, I think we did a lot to help people. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">They were in far away <span class="NPIP">places</span> ; <span class="REGION">South America</span> or elsewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">JDC followed them along and did what it could to give them some kind of break. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I think people are entitled to a break in life, and if you can do something to help them if they didn't have a break, I think you should. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And I think that motivated a lot of people to do what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And I think that accounts for JDC's success. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And then when you add to that the personalities in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , the lay people, who were behind the JDC and the thought that they give to it, they're entitled to a lot of credit. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">They helped create the atmosphere which makes people happy to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And that's all one's asking, . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">I don't think I have to add anything to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I think in words of one syllable that would account for JDC's success that there isn't much that can still be done, there's always more that can be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Lots of people, they had this tendency, when they look at the <span class="DLF">brick wall</span> , they don't look at the bricks, they only look at the <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="677">They don't see the accomplishments. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">They only see what was undone. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">They see the <span class="DLF">hole</span> , they don't see the bricks. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Every once in a while we sit back and we look at the bricks too, and you get a certain feeling of satisfaction out of doing it, doing something for somebody else, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">You don't get wealthy at it, but the satisfaction that you get remains with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I think that the success that the JDC has had accounts for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">CONLUSION OF INTERVIEW </span>
