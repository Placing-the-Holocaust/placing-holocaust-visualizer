And they were affiliated with the Ushers, which was a very important patrician family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">So — and then there was the family of Souget, s-o-u-g-e-t, of which there is an extensive family tree in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> at the genealogical institute of the <span class="BUILDING">University of Jerusalem</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  What was the — what was the — what was the world like there? </span><span class="sentence" id="13">It was — was — were people connected also by professions? </span><span class="sentence" id="14">That is, did they — did they family’s you mentioned also have business interests together?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  So that was — yeah, that was sort of the — but they were not connected professionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">It was really at — from what I recall, it was really a family affair. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I inherited the wedding banquet photograph of my parents, 1929, November. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I lost touch with these people when I was about nine, and yet I could mention — I could name, of the 45 people who were invited, roughly 23 — 43, sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Which, for a kid that age — so it was th-th-the — the family impressions that sort of stayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  What kind of — what kind of childhood do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  I had a terrific childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I was a st — a single child for three and a half years. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I was well liked. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I was rather shy, funny enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">But my mother spent a lot of time with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">My mother was sort of a frustrated tomboy, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">We went swimming together. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">She compiled lists of auto makes for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">We clipped out Rupert, the — the comic strip, Rupert the Bear, from the newspaper and made picture books out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I was allowed to read the newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">The newspaper used to come in in the evening, fall on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mat</span> behind the <span class="DLF">front door</span> , and I was allowed to read it as long as I was — took — treated it neatly. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And of course, I couldn’t read at three and a half, but I could make out the pictures that were in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So I consider that a very good sort of start of 1—a sense of literacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I’ve always loved reading, I could always be find with a book — be found with a book, and then I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at age five. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">That was a very strange thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I’m born in September, as I said, and I would not be allowed into the first grade, because I became six on the 16" of September. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">But as I said, I had a very scrappy mother, who didn’t take this lying down, and who interpreted the — the law that you couldn’t go into the first grade with age five, as saying that you could enter grade two at age six. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">There were more mothers like that, and I went to a <span class="BUILDING">preparatory</span> first grade, which was quite wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">It must have been expensive, there were all kinds of kids of —
QUESTION:  It’s a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER: <span class="BUILDING"> Private school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Kids of reasonably wealthy, middle class families. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And it was about that time in 1935 that my mother gave birth to my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And I said at that point to my father that I didn’t think it was a good idea that I would go on vacation with mother any longer — I was very politically oriented — because she would need all her attention for my little brother, and her newborn baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And my father said, what do you have in mind? </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And I said, well, I heard in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there 1s something like a kinder pensionne, a <span class="BUILDING">youth hostel</span> for young children. [</span><span class="sentence" id="50">cough] Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And I would be very interested in going to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">The kids in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> think it’s terrific. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And my father asked around, colleagues of his in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , mostly Jewish, and he found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me to go to with a colleague of his who needed some extra money, who had a bigger <span class="BUILDING">house</span> than he could really afford, and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was full of kids, and they would have a <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So, come the Christmas holidays, my father took me to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amersfoort</span> , east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was very cold, we did gymnastics, I remember that as of yesterday, in order to stay warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And
QUESTION:  It must have looked funny having your father do gymnastics.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, we were hanging from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage racks</span> , and things like that, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And — and it was fun to be together with my father, nobody else on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">It was a d — sort of a seminal experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And I— so we came there, to this wonderful <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , which was full of German kids, émigré kids
QUESTION:  German Jewish kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  German Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Was kosher, the whole <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">We had a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">We had — let me go back a bit to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for a moment, we had the maid, a nanny, a lady for rough work, and a seamstress who came every Tuesday afternoon, because we were not beyond having a patch in our pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">She did the necessary stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">So that was sort of the household personnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">My mother always did the cooking. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">She didn’t leave that to anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  I’m jealous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Well, if you have a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> , you don’t want to delegate that, necessarily.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  And anyway, they loved to have me there, I — I remember that they gave me my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">It was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">harmonica bed</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  What’s a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">harmonica bed</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  It’s a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">camp cot</span> that collapses, but it was called a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">harmonica bed</span> , which I had to make every night. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Make my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and take off my bedding in the morning, fold it up nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I was only five, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And so I — or was I six? </span><span class="sentence" id="79">No, I think I was five. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And I had to place this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> between two <span class="DLF">sliding doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Much later I realized that these pla — people didn’t have any <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> for me, that the harmonica bed was sort of an expediency. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">That the <span class="NPIP">place</span> bes — the space between two <span class="DLF">sliding doors</span> sort of happened to be, and they could use the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">But that didn’t detract from the fun of the situation, had a wonderful two weeks there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  So ye — wa — did they have this sort — kinder pensionne in — in this pla — had they already organized it and it had been fully booked, and that’s why there had been no <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and you came in kind of late, as a registration?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  And did you talk to these kids who were refugee kids much, about where they had come from, and did the adult world in any way —
ANSWER:  Nobody spoke about these things, the kids — kids are kids, they’re — they’ re interested in — in the here and now, not in the hereafter, and in the world to come, or what have you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  So, there was no talk about we had to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and had something like that

<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  So it had been in the family for quite some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I have a telephone book of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> in 1915, and both my grandfathers had telephone, which in those years was rather unusual.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Very unusual.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">My grandfather on my mother’s side was in the diamond business.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  Yeah, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But I was always off on Saturday morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">In those years <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were working — were operating on Saturday morning, so I never went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I did have — and — and the only thing that they graded you on that was done on Saturday morning was singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So, every quarter I had to sing very privately, but in public, a song on which I was being graded. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And I remember having the street smarts to sing a patriotic song, so that nobody could accuse me of either being too Jewish, or too whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I —
QUESTION:  Or not Dutch enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  Or not — yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I — I sang a song that was sort of the exhilaration of Dutch passion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Did you like the song?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Yeah, I made sure that I liked the song, but I also made sure that the song —
QUESTION:  Was appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  — was for the purpose that I intended it to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  That’s a lot of thinking for somebody who 1s a little boy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, but I think that is also genetically induced. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">There’s something about survival, even in civilized circumstances that sort of prepares you for these kind of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">It — I don’t think I’m supersensitive on that, but I — I do feel that — well, you’re never totally part of the social fabric because the people let you feel that you’re a little bit different. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So, on your own, you try to minimize that difference as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  Do you have any memories of how that was — how you felt that, when you were — before the war, as a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Specific instances, I — I really don’t remember, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">You know, for one thing, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was a — a tolerant society in the sense that in 1848 everybody got civil rights, yo — everybody became a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So you — you — you had voting rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And the Jews — the Catholics actually were the last ones to — to get their civil rights, but — so no, there was no particular sense of apprehension. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But you know, you knew sort of intuitively that if you were to — called upon to sing, you didn’t sing the Hatikva even if it was a song that you knew best. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">You sang something that was typically Dutch, and extolled the virtue of the nation. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So that was — I stayed in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> until the Germans invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , that was in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So for us the war started in 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  What was the date, do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Yeah, it was the 10" of May.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Do you remember the day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  I remember it very vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">It was just before the Whitsun fa — vacation, Pentecost is Whitsun.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  And I heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> coming over, and I went to see my parents 1n their <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , and they said that the Germans had invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , that was on the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And I had a stamp collection of German inflationary stamps from post World War I, and I asked my father if we couldn’t buy these guys off with all these mo — millions of marks that I had of these little stamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">That I remember very clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">My f— 1n — and this is also important, this is actually very important; in — during the Whitsun vacation in 1939, so that is roughly May - June, my mother and my father left for <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> on a short vacation, and my mother went to <span class="BUILDING">Australia house</span> to get visas for us for <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  You anticipated my next question, which was, by the time of that invasion, had there been discussions in your family about —
ANSWER:  Absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  — how to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And they got visas for our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">My mother got visas for her two sisters and their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Must have been easy to get that, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">But my oldest uncle said, we can’t leave, we cannot leave my father-in-law to his own devices. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">We can’t leave him alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  That would have been your grandfather?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  My grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And my father said, Mother, in times of need, the captain does not leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">That the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> intended to kick the captain off the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> was something that nobody was thinking of. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">So we didn’t use the visas.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  Oh my.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  Oh my.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  I want to say that that was never — it was never a point of dispute between my parents, my mother was incredibly loyal. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I do not understand why they didn’t see the danger, because it was being spelled out in capital letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">If I may refresh your memory, because you’re stu — you’re st — quite a bit younger than I am; it started off with <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , with <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , then it went all the way to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , who were declare — who had declared themselves neutral, and the Dutch government said nothing will happen here. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So this kind of lulling the troops to sleep was something that everybody wanted to believe in. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Just like Islam 1s a religion of peace, which it isn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">But we like to believe it, because it creates a comfort zone for us. [</span><span class="sentence" id="189">indecipherable] I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1991. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I worked there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="392">ANSWER:  No, that 1s upon reflection later on, yeah, because you don’t have time to be hurt, you have to sort of find out what’s going on and — so that — that — I went there for a year, my brother and my sister, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And — and actually my sister went to a — sort of a —I don’t know what it was, a <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> of sorts, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And then we were told — no, then, in the fall of 41, my father could no longer work, because he could not use public transportation, and he decided to spend a bit more time with my brother and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And on Saturday morning we used to go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And one morning in the fall of °41, we came back from <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> , and a man stepped out of his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , crossed his <span class="DLF">garden path</span> and positioned himself in front of my father and said, I’d like to ask you a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And that was a dicey thing because you didn't know who the hell the guy was and he could denounce you. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And he said — and my father said, okay, ask the question. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And he said, are you Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And my father said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">He said, I thought so. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I see you come by there every Saturday morning with your two sons, nice thing to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I know a bit about Jews because I used to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , blah, blah, blah. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">He said, but that’s not really — that’s not really why I wanted to ask you that question. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I would like to know what are you going to do about the resettlement of the Dutch Jews in the east? </span><span class="sentence" id="406">There had been discussions that the Dutch Jews were going to be evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">That was an emigration department of the Jewish council, and the resettlement would take place in the east, where that was, we didn’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">QUESTION:  Do you mean <span class="REGION">east Holland</span> , or <span class="REGION">east Europe</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">ANSWER: <span class="REGION"> East Europe</span> , yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And it could have been <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which was not really <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , but it certainly was east of the <span class="DLF">Dutch border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And my father said, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I — my Gentile friends are not talking to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">They want to see how this thing evolves, and my Jewish friends in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> as I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And my brother and I were standing there, you know, seeing how this thing evolved. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And this man said something that is quite incredible when you think about it, he said, may I help you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">QUESTION:  Oh my.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  And this man knew about discrimination, he was a hunchback. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And he felt that his time had come. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">There’s certain people who rise to the occasion at the appropriate and almost pre-ordained time. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And this man, who had been discriminated against all his life, married to a very nice woman, felt that this was his opportunity to shine. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">To be in charge of something, despite his handicap.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">QUESTION:  Did your father accept?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">ANSWER:  Not right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">He said that I don’t want you to endanger yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I mean, he didn’t know which way this whole thing was going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">QUESTION:  He didn't know who he was talking to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER:  That’s exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And the man said, may I come to your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and discuss this with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="429">So my father said, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And that’s how we went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I wasn’t privy to the discussions, I wasn’t privy to anything that happened, except that one day in June of 1942, after we had been resettled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> was going to become a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> —

<p><span class="sentence" id="440">QUESTION:  Well, there are — there — there is that kind of talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I mean —
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="445">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">ANSWER:  Yeah, I said at three o’clock I will meet somebody at the movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">But we can always continue later on.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="449">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">QUESTION:  So let’s talk until you have to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">ANSWER:  So, we’ll — we’ll talk up to in going into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">So the lady came and she — she asked for the kids, and only much later in life have I realized that first my parents resisted the Germans physically and mentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Secondly, that they divested themselves of their children, without any hope whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Or maybe with only hope that they would be treated right, that people would like them, that they would be fed properly, in the hope that they would see them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I don’t wish that on any parent. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">It is the most abhorrent thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">QUESTION:  Do you remember the day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">ANSWER:  In June, no, I remember when I went into hiding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">QUESTION:  That’s what I mean, that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">ANSWER:  Okay, that was in August, it was the 12" of August. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I know that because the 10" of August was the birthday of my cousin, and I went to his birthday party. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And I went the 12" of August. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">After my brother and sister left, my father broke down and cried, and asked me if I would look after the kids in the event that he came to grief — after the kids and my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">So there you stand, 11 years old, you know, what do you say? </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Yes, Pa. And so I was taken to — by the same lady, to a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">The summer of ’42 was gorgeous. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And I had to look after my own breakfast and my own lunch, and in the main <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the people who owned the <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> , they got my dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">My brother spent a brief time with me there, he was in between two addresses and it was nice to see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And at that time, there was something going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">| can’t —

<p><span class="sentence" id="471">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">ANSWER:  South of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">That was a very interesting thing that I’ve only later diagnosed or evalued. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And that is that there was a saying the war will be over by Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And there is corollary to that, that if the war is not over by this Christmas, then it surely will be over next Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">It meant that every Jew in hiding had a <span class="DLF">window</span> of opportunity of 365 days, with an automatic renewal, because if anybody had asked will you take Leonard Vis in, from August ’42 til May 45, you would have had a resounding no. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">So this crazy Christian notion, because wars have to be end around Christmas with peace on earth and all this kind of stuff, was very beneficial to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Of course it’s a crazy Christian notion, but to we — it was to our advantage. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And that’s —
QUESTION:  Wait, did you stay in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">ANSWER:  No, because the <span class="NPIP">place</span> with the — the <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> wasn’t winterized. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">So in November of "42, I was taken to a very nice family with a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And we can talk about that in the st —

QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Leonard Vis, on November 9", 2008 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> , <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">So, Mr. Vis, where did we leave off?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">ANSWER:  I left off when winter came, and the <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> that I was living in was not winterized, and my handlers decided — these were friends of Uncle Bill — my handlers decided that I had to be moved to a more clement environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">QUESTION:  Were they kind? </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Were the people that you came into contact with now, were they kind, or were they indifferent, or how were they?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">ANSWER:  They were very casual about the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">To them I was just a kid who needed a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">The Jewishness sort of didn’t figure in too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I think it was important to them that I could lead my own life, they were very intellectual people; he was a journalist and she was a screenwriter. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And they had a young son, and they lived their life in the main <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I lived my life in the <span class="BUILDING">wooden shack</span> , and you know, like everybody else, they also thought that the war would be over by Christmas, and that the Tommys would be coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">We hadn’t really thought about the Americans, but the Tommys were close by, and the Tommys could do everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And the interesting thing was that they really — you know, they lulled themselves to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">They thought you could rid of the Germans just like that, and that the persecution of the Jews, I suppose was — was one of those things that are part of the war, and you have to take that in stride. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I don’t think that after I left they were engaged in any other illegal activity, but at the time they did what they felt, and they felt good about it, so —
QUESTION:  I mean, but were they indifferent to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I mean, sounds like pretty much — it’s a certainly — not an — not even a two class system, but here is the <span class="BUILDING">upper house</span> , and here way down low —

<p><span class="sentence" id="505">QUESTION:  So in a way it was an adventure?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">ANSWER:  Absolutely, yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION:  How did you keep yourself occupied in that <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">ANSWER:  Reading, crossword puzzles. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">My mother taught me years ago, long before I went into hiding, that crossword puzzles are a good thing, it’s part of my literacy situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I still do them. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And of course I was out in the open, so there was a bit of investigation of nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I knew a little bit about mushrooms that I’d learned in the children’s pensionne, so it —
QUESTION:  Did anybody come talk to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">A young man joined me there in, I guess, October. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Very nice young man, he — for the longest — I knew that his first name was Joe. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">For the longest time I really didn’t remember his last name, his omer — his honest last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Everybody had sort of an alias. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">But thanks to a wonderful database that has just become public in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , I found out who he was, and pretty well what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">He was caught and deported, but he didn't die in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for some reason or other, he died somewhere else, 1n a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And the only reason that I found him was that I remember the <span class="DLF">street</span> on which he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">QUESTION:  He had told you about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">ANSWER:  And 60 years later I look on the database — was some 70 years later, I look on the database, I type in the name, and there I fi— the name of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and there I find him.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="552">QUESTION:  And nobody did any kind of investigation to prove him wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">ANSWER:  Nothing at all, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">In fact, we should have taken more risks in those days, but we didn’t, because we were very law abiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">You didn’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">If the government asked you for something, you responded. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">He — but in the summer of ’42 — oh yeah, th — let me tell you what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">He was into magnetism. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">He was sort — some kind of a mature [indecipherable] lettre. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">He felt that he had precious magnetic powers —
QUESTION:  Magnetic fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="561">ANSWER:  Yeah, and if you had a headache, then he could sort of — as you can imagine, it was not a well paid position. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And he was not unhappy when his sister called and said, I got my papers to report for resettlement in the east, can I sit this thing out with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And he took her in with her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">It was his oldest sister, Rochelle. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And shortly thereafter his brother Sam called with his wife, and said they got their papers and could they come to him, and he said okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And then two younger sisters of his called, each with a son, and he said okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And then I came and — well, of course, his — he was — all of a sudden he was the proprietor of a B and B and L and D, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and breakfast, lunch and dinner.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">QUESTION:  Oh yeah.</span></p>
