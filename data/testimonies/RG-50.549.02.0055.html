<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  May I ask you why do you think that it was only German Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  At that time the Germans had a system. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">They felt if they could get first rid of German Jews, that wouldn’t disturb the Dutch Jews too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">The one thing they didn’t want is any kind of -- I don’t want to call it an uprising, but they didn’t want any trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And by taking the German ga -- the Germans developed a system where they took one part of a group of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">They didn’t just arrest Jews, it was always a group of Jews, it was first the German Jews, then the male -- male Jews between the ages of 16 and 21, then another little group, then another little group. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">There was always a group, so that everybody else still felt, “Oh my God, thank goodness they didn’t take me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And this was the German mode of operation, one group at a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Then they took people who were not married. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">It was young people if not married, then young people to a certain age, who were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">You know, it was always a group of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  It makes me wonder, between the German Jews and the Dutch Jews, before that time, did you communicate with the other Jewish community?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Oh yes, indeed, indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Could you talk about that a little bit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  Well the -- the -- the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> were very liberal in their -- in their -- in their life, at -- it -- they -- we had perfect communication, there was no difference between the German Jews and the Dutch Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">There was no anti-Semitism that I was aware of. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I spoke fluently Dutch, so did my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And nobody ever asked, you know, where were you born. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We were -- We were Jews, living in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">As fact, we were living next door to Anne Frank. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Anne Frank and I grew up together, and our history is almost identical. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Yo -- Which of course I have recorded previously, at the -- at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and -- etcetera.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  The Frank family, were they distinctive in any way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">He was -- He was a businessman who started -- who was a successful businessman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">He -- He came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , and started a new business, and it was in that business of his, on the princinkraft which -- where the family and some other people were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">It was in his business, and of course the story is well known, I’m not going to go through that story. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">He was -- He was an average businessman, and the girls --
QUESTION:  And he was friends with your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I would not say they were -- we were friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">We were -- We knew each other, let’s put it that way, and that’s about -- don’t forget the girls -- Anne was six or seven years younger than I was, and when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , I was 11, and Anne was five. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And as an 11 year old boy, you do not have too much connections with a five year old girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And even though her sister was, I think, two years older, but she also was much younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So --
ANSWER:  How about your pre-war recollection then, of anti-Semitism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  None -- Well, except for the fact that Hitler came to power in 1933, in -- I believe it was January, and of course we had -- the Nazi movement was very active in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and as far as that is concerned, we -- we were -- I wa -- I wouldn’t say suffering, it was 1933, we were very much aware of what the Nazi movement was all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And my father decided -- he was a very successful architect in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , he decided he didn’t want his two sons to grow up under this regime, and therefore made the sacrifice of leaving his successful business, and went to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , where in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> we were not allowed to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Anyways, he was not allowed to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">You could live there, but you could not work there, that was the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  How did you make a living?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Well, my father -- my father worked, you might call it illegally, for a <span class="BUILDING">Dutch bank</span> , was a private ban -- it was a -- in -- in -- in Europe you have a lot of these <span class="BUILDING">private banks</span> , it’s not like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chase-Manhattan</span> here, or so, it was just a littl -- little <span class="BUILDING">private bank</span> , it so happened it was owned by a member of the family, that <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And my mother, she took in people to live with us, <span class="DLF">borders</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">She took in <span class="DLF">borders</span> and so, between those two, we made a -- a -- just barely a living.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Do you remember feeling poor, or were you glad to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , or --
ANSWER:  No, we never felt poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">It is true that we did not have a lot of things that other people had, in other words, we didn’t own a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , or you know, we f-finally were able to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , my brother and I, each. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And -- But I never felt poor, even though I think we were poor, but we never felt poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  And your experience in the <span class="BUILDING">Dutch schools</span> was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Oh, was perfect. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I -- I loved it, I was good at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">My -- My best subject was Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I -- I -- I got the highest -- the highest numbers in -- in -- in Dutch language, and I -- and I spoke almost without an accent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  As you do now, so -- now, in going into wartime and the connections, your connections with the underground, with the Dutch underground --
ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  I know at one time you mentioned that the underground found you and your mother hiding in a haystack?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  Well, no, that -- yes, we were hiding in a haystack, but we were on a -- my father -- my father, my mother and I -- that was after my brother already had been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">We’re taking about the year 1942, my father, my mother and I went to a <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> , in the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , a province of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limberg</span> , and there was a problem there, there was another family that came, a Mr. and Mrs. Kahn, and Mrs. Kahn was a very attractive young lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Her husband was an accountant, and he looked -- I don’t know how those two ever got married, he was the opposite from her, and she started an affair with the farmer, very -- wit -- I mean, a very silly thing to do, in -- under the circumstances, and the wife of the farmer found out about it, and she -- they had children, and in her despair, and I can’t blame her, she went to the Gestapo and told them what the problem was, and so one day, while we were all sitting for ouch -- we were sitting down at dinner time, I look -- we looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and there were four or five Gestapo agents driving up and coming -- you know, running into the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And Mr. Kahn -- Mrs. Kahn went out the <span class="DLF">back door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">My father went up -- went up in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , and my mother went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and I went into a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I mean, it’s -- it’s not a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> as we know it in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , it’s you know, it’s just a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , and there was a little <span class="DLF">ledge</span> , and I was hiding behind the <span class="DLF">ledge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And they arrested my father, and they arrested Mr. Kahn, and my mother and I, we -- it’s a long story, really, but she was hiding in a <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> , and they -- they opened up every <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and finally they -- to make a very long story short, there’s much more to it, but during the night, I put up a <span class="DLF">ladder</span> against the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and ma -- got my mother out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and then we went into a haystack, and then after that, there was a young girl -- this was way past midnight -- a young girl of the Dutch -- of the Dutch underground, sh-she probably was no more than 16 or 17 years old, came on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> to tell us that the -- th-the Germans were aware that they were -- that they had missed two more Jews, that’s my mother and I, and Mrs. Kahn for that matter, and so they were on their way back. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So, we were in a haystack, yes, but only for about a couple of hours, until the young girl came, and we had to leave there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  I wanted to ask you what your experiences all together were, with the Dutch underground, and if you were aided by any other philanthropic agency.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I had no -- I did not have much experience with the Dutch underground, as a fact, I didn’t even know who that young girl was. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I found out much later, that she was a member of the un -- I mean, a member of the underground, and the -- the person who had originally -- was helping us, and we were hiding in his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> before we went down to the <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> , was a professor. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I obm -- I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> for one year, and he was one of the professors --
QUESTION:  Where did you go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">It’s a engineering college, which I really wasn’t interested in engineering, but my father thought I should be in -- in architecture, which I didn’t want, and so I wound up in -- in engineering, which I didn’t want either, but that’s a long story. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And so, I didn’t know, I had no idea until much, much later, that Mr. -- that my di -- professor, whose name was Mr. Initout, was a member of the Dutch underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">He never told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">It was much later, towards the end of the war, and it was when we -- when we fled the <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> , we -- we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , and back to Mr. Initout, where we were originally, in his small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  Did he know you were coming?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  Well, when I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , I made a telephone call from that -- from the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , and told them what had happened, that my father was arrested, and -- you know, and he was -- he -- he was absolutely great, without giving it a minute thought, he told us to come right over, which wasn’t so easy because, remember, we were Jews, and I -- I look pretty Jewish, and we -- every Jew was supposed to wear a yellow star, which -- which we wore, but not after we went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And so here we’re in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> without the Jewish star, and we were not allowed to be on a -- on a -- on a -- on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> or - or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> , as they call it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , so we had -- we walked all the way from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> central, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> west. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">As fact, he lived only a few blocks from where Anne Frank was hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So actually, Anne Frank, after we went into hiding, we -- known- unbeknown to each other, we were very, very close to each other, in -- in distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  Is that when your mother and you began to live together silently in the one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  In one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We lived in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> from 19 -- we lived in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for two and a half years. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Never saw the light, never saw -- I mean, I saw light, but never saw the sunshine coming, never ch --
QUESTION:  There was no <span class="DLF">window</span> in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  There was a -- There was a <span class="DLF">window</span> , yeah, you -- you could see the light, but you were never exposed to the sunshine. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">In other words, as you know, in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , or in most civilized <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , if you’re in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , you’re allowed at least one hour a day of exercise, and -- and being exposed to sunlight and -- and -- and etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">We have not been out of that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for two and a half years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  Wa -- Ya -- I -- [heard your story, and hearing it, I was so curious that there could be all these people coming to visit him, and him a member of the underground, and yet they- are you sure they did not know, or did they just not tell that they knew that you and your mother were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  Well, I can’t -- The only thing -- I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I don’t know the answer to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I know that his brother-in-law knew that we were there because -- and there -- I’m sure there were some other people that knew about it, who he felt he could trust. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">But the -- the sad part of the story is that four weeks, or approximately four weeks before the end of the war, he was caught by the Germans on one of his missions, he was on a mission, I don’t know wh-what his mission was, and he was caught and he was executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And so --
QUESTION:  How did you and your mother find out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  We -- There was, again, somebody from the underground who came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , t-to tell us that terrible news. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">His wife, incidentally, had died about a year before, but she died of natural causes. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So I can’t -- So we were just informed of it, and we had to, again, in a big, big hurry, to leave -- leave the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  And how was it arranged where you would go next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  That was another -- Again, I can’t tell -- through the underground, now, I don’t know much about it, they had a -- a name and an address for us, it was another teacher and his wife, who I’d never met, never heard their name mentioned, and that’s where we spent the last four weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  And by that time, were the professor’s children teenagers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Yeah, they were -- they had a boy and a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">The girl was -- The boy was my age, and the girl was maybe two years older.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  What was your relationship, if any, with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Well, was a very good relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Y-You -- You can imagine living in -- in -- you know, it was a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">They had -- There were three <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> , I believe, and one was occupied by the -- by the parents, one was occupied by the brother and sister, who had separate <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> , but because of -- because of us coming there, they had to share the -- a <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , and then my mother and I shared the other <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , and so it’s been a --
QUESTION:  So they knew you were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Oh yes, oh yes, they were -- you know --
QUESTION:  Did they bring you food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Well, of course, food in th -- probably the worst part of that entire war experience was the last six - nine months, where we had no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">There was no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Now, you might say, how do y -- how do you exist on no food? </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Well, we ate what is called pulp, which is stuff that is fed to the -- to the -- to the cows. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And that’s what we ate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  ’'m curious to know more about your friendship with the teenage children, especially after their father died. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Were you able to keep 1n touch?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, as fact, th-the daughter got married pretty soon after. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">She married a -- a minister, a -- a Protestant minister. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And somehow over the years, we -- we lost contact and the son, I had brought over here, fo-for a visit, I wanted him to see <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  How did you -- How do you mean you brought him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Well, I -- I wanted him to see <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and so we somehow got together here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> for just about a week or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And just showing him around, and --
QUESTION:  What year was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  My goodness. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I don’t really remember, but 1t was probably, if I came in 1945, I would say probably in 19 -- early ‘50.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  And did you pay his way, or send him money, or --
ANSWER:  It so happened, no, I did not pay his way, he came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">He worked -- He worked for a company which had sent him over here, it’s just that he had quite a bit of time on his hand, and it was whatever he had to do for his company, it -- 1t did not take that long, and so I had a lot of time that I could show him -- I wouldn’t -- I didn’t show him <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , but I did show him <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">That’s -- That’s as far as I could go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  | -- It -- Is there anything else you want to add before we get to the liberation and after?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  Well, you know, if I had to do that, I would have to start from -- from day one, and I don’t think, you know, and I’ve done that, an-and it’s on tape, and it’s in the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">No, I -- I -- I just would say, like I said before, that the last six - nine months were horrible, just horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I mean, again, you might say, compared to what? </span><span class="sentence" id="125">To the poor people who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , it wasn’t horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">But I am probably one of the few people that know what hunger is. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And I's -- when I say hunger, I mean hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We talk about hunger, about poor people in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Yes, that may be so, but that’s not hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Hunger means you have nothing to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">You c -- You can eat grass, or you can eat, you know, you -- you just have nothing to eat, there was nothing, nothing to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And -- And that was not just us, I mean, the Dutch people living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And one of the reasons was, because <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was -- the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was liberated already in 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">There was one little pocket of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , the province of north -- <span class="REGION">north Holland</span> , which had <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> , and The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> in there, that little pocket, it’s a -- you know, it’s a -- <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> is a small <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> altogether, but that little pocket was not liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Hitler already had committed suicide, and we were still under occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">The entire cun -- The entire continent of Europe was liberated, except -- I mean, I’m only talking about days now, that little part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> , and ha- and -- and -- and -- and The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> , were still under German occupation for a couple of days after Hitler had committed suicide, So we were the very last one, and that’s why there was no food, period.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  Because there was no transport allowed through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  I can’t tell you the reason why, all I know 1s we were absolutely starving, starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And so, I know what hunger 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I would wake up in the middle of the night -- in the middle of the night, I would wake up and -- and -- and jump up in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , because why’? </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Because I saw a piece of bread in my dream, and that gave me a complete nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  Well, ’'m going to turn over to -- to side B --
ANSWER:  Ok --
QUESTION:  -- to talk about liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B
QUESTION:  So I'd -- I'd really -- I-I know that I was very touched by your words, “I didn’t cry for five years during the war, but when I saw Jewish boys, with Jewish stars on Canadian uniforms,” --
