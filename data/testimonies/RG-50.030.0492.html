<p><span class="sentence" id="488">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And the basic -- my faith, the Catholic faith 1s based on the Bible, and -- which is Jewish experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">So, in other word, number one is understanding of the -- of the structure -- intellectual structure of a deconstruction wh-which si -- is contrary to the fundamental Jewish tradition which, insofar is 1t is common to the Christian origin. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Number two 1-15, if possible, try to be more interactive, or more intelligent in spreading basic knowledge, even for kids and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">QUESTION:  I see, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">ANSWER:  In <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , and so on, and of course at the upper level even more, of Judaism, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And third is that fred -- friendship business.</span></p>
