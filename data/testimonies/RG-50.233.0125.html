<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Today is March 27, 1992. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">I’m Anthony Di Iorio and I’m at the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of Mrs. Irene Shapiro in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ipsmont</span> , New York and I’m here on behalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to interview Mrs. Shapiro about her experiences and those of her family during the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Good afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Good afternoon to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  I thought perhaps we could begin by having you tell us where you were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I was born in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ukrainian town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brezany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">It was part of what’s now known as the <span class="REGION">Polish Ukraine</span> and the breadbasket of both <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> and later the Soviet Union.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  And when were you born there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  1925, which was ancient history of course, and well, I was born there as I explained to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">It was almost accidental, certainly not historically awaited, and that is, I was -- my parents were at that time living in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula River</span> before it goes into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Gdansk Bay</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">The name is Gludjan. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">However that time there were no, very few Jewish people, perhaps, and no rabbis and no moyels and so my mother in her eighth or ninth month of pregnancy went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> two days back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brezany</span> where a midwife would deliver just a girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Just a girl?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Just a girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Were you an only child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">At that point I was the one and only, but later on another “just a girl” came along but she was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gludjan</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  So you were born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brezany</span> when it was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brezany</span> became part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in 1918 with the Treaty of Versailles.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  And you grew up not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brezany</span> but in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gludjan</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gludjan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Until 1938 I lived in that part. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">It was known as the <span class="DLF">corridor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">It was everybody’s transit point since ancient times, since the Teutonic orders yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And in 1938 my family was forced to leave the <span class="DLF">corridor</span> or and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> , and that was an entirely different part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">It was the formerly Russian part. </span><span class="sentence" id="26"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was under occupation for 150 years, and that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was a czarist part. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So everybody spoke Russian and it had the looks of a Russian part. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">It was poorly maintained <span class="DLF">streets</span> , whereas <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gludjan</span> was a western German, typically <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German town</span> , and in 1938 for one year I attended the 4" grade of <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> , Polish junior high school in the so-called <span class="BUILDING">Druszki Gymnasium</span> which was the most expensive but very modern academically very advanced junior high school and <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And then I entered the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in 1939 but the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> became in the Soviet 10" year school . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">The Soviets occupied as part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">This was the Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">It was fortunate for us as I told you before. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">The Germans did come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsic</span> for one week and promised us a proper, final solution even then, but the Soviets intervened and so we lived under Soviet occupation and most ordinary people, and especially from the viewpoint of a child we had a very good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">This was the time when they sort of tried to schmaltz up to us kids, tried to get us to the Pioneer Organization and the Counselor Organization and politicized us and etc., </span><span class="sentence" id="35">etc., </span><span class="sentence" id="36">etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Pll never forget myself screaming at our landlord: ‘if you don’t fix that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> ?'</span><span class="sentence" id="38">m going to tell on you.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="39">This was the time, but generally it was a normal time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  You’re talking about the Russian occupation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  The Russian occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I wanted to set the record straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">People are expecting us to say all bad things about the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Not at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">They were very careful about anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">They put people in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for anti-Semitic expression, so I saw absolutely, I saw nothing, but of course my friends whose fathers were factory owners and such were sent to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  And what was their crime? </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Being a class enemy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  Bring class enemy having employed and not having workers testifying for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Apparently if the workers testified and intervened they might have been given some jail sentence but their family was not removed and otherwise they were removed especially if they were very wealthy and didn’t get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Most people who had that kind of money could also get out because <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> at the beginning was not yet a Soviet republic until 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">There were quite a few months and many people did go through <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and such. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Some even got to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Many had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Did any members of your family go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  My uncle left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> much before that as a young law student from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lember Wolf</span> as a Zionist and --
QUESTION:  That’s your father’s brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  That’s my father’s brother and he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> until very recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">In fact, I did not know, he adopted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">You see, I was nineteen and a half when the war finished and was still adoptable. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I think it was still until twenty-one. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And he adopted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">But I didn’t know and I went to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and he was just heartbroken, and I would have been his daughter in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> while I was already in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  Could you tell us more about growing up in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , as a little girl and then as a young adult?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  Well, the times I had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grujan</span> were not particularly happy for me personally because I had a very strict father, still the <span class="BUILDING">Austrian school</span> where you’ve got to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on time, you can’t go -- you can’t pal around with somebody whom we don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And that let out most of the Jewish boys and girls that I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">They were all daughters and sons of lower merchants and merchants and as I’m told by a friend whom I know now, my parents were stuck up. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And I missed on this and I interpreted all this as it was I who wasn’t popular, nobody liked me, I had no friends and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And I became --I was very bright, and excellent student, so I didn’t suffer any anti- Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">This was a Polish girls’ Gymnasium; I was the only Jewish child in class, but so good a student that I was always at the top of the list all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">But I wasn’t very happy as very young teenager. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Also most of the kids, they were a little older than I was and looked down upon me. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">But when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystople</span> , that made my day. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I was in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> with all Jewish girls and boys who all loved me. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I became not only popular but I was voted in a an S.0.G.O. whatever, students’ organization president prior to the coming of the Soviets, and then after that when the Soviets marched in I ran into a problem because they voted me in but the Soviets didn’t want to have a non-Communist, and I proudly announced that I was a Zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Well, that was the worst thing you should have stated. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">They were forced by my colleagues to let me be, to be the president of their Utchcom the student committee, but at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> my mother packed my valise and waited for the NK VV then -- the KGB now -- to come and take me away cause nobody ever heard for a little pipsqueak of a teenager pronouncing proudly -- that I defended -- that was a left-wing Zionism and very close to Marxism. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">In fact, Marxists, the Zionists and we the Jews have the same right to feel proud of our nationality, as did the other Soviet republics. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I in essence negated the Jewish question of Stalin, the little pamphlet, that the Jews are not really a nation because they don’t have a land of their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  Sounds like your heart belongs to your uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  It sort of disappeared on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I was very easily swayed to look the other way and then I joined the Pioneers, you know, which wasn’t much of a plan either, and I sort of had the left-winger’s leniency because of my revolt against my parents and my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I played with daughters of supers in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and working kids and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So, in Soviet Bialystok I was very busy with political affairs of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I was on the committee and I was in charge of the newspaper and what not, very, very involved with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Very little time for my poor mother, and it was the first time in her life that she didn’t have a servant. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">You had to have a doctor’s certificate to be entitled to a maid and she didn’t have. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I feel very guilty about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  Your activities as a student and with this paper, was this always in Polish or Yiddish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  No, no the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> became a <span class="BUILDING">Russian school</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with a Russian language of instruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I am fluent, or was at least till the --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  You’re fluent in Russian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  Oh, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I was a so-called otlichnica which means I had all “A’’s and therefore I could enter the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> without an exam. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And based on that I was able to get my Regents, my graduation diploma because the list of these otlichnica was kept somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I came here to the <span class="BUILDING">Soviet consulate</span> , where they piously tried to say to me what are you doing in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , you should go back to the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">But they did get me testimony of so-and-so, I gave the name of my director that I was a very good student ---- otlichnica.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  You were conducting your own pro-Zionist activity?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  Oh, no, I knew better within a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">This was in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">After people started disappearing and after my friends came to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> crying, I knew better. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">It was just the beginning; no, after that I never owned up to anything other, oh, I fervently, I very much -- I really enjoyed what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">You have to understand this. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They made us, as kids feel very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I discussed this with the people who survived that. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We all had the same feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Who cared what they did to the grownups, or the capitalists. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I mean we were kids and they had all kinds of things for the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">They had a way of getting us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  You’re referring now to the Communists?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And, well, we were too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">You couldn’t even think of being a Communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">In fact, that isn’t what they were interested in. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">They wanted us to be supportive, and we were, some of us at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I was one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  How would you describe or summarize the political information of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  You see, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> always had a left-wing population. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">They were not Communists; they were ----. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It was the second international. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I don’t know, besides the leaders who were sent out, some of them, most of them I think, switched. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">They had a large workers population that possibly support them and the rest were as anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I was very opportunistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">That was the way to get ajob. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">That was the way to get ahead and my father had a warm feeling about the Soviets because really they saved his life, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">He was caught up in the revolution. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">He was captured as an Austrian prisoner of war and when they took him out of that <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , it was going from whites to reds, from whites to reds, and the reds ---
QUESTION:  You’re talking about World War I and then the Revolution?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  1917 -- that’s right, and he was when the reds came, he was pronounced to be a white, or was it the other way around, one way or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So they were supposed to execute him, and they did apparently, but one of the ladies there whom my father was in love with traded his freedom for some money or what and he became -- they liberated him and he was able to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so he was very, very thankful to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  How did your father get to be a judge?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  He was the bandleader in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">He was, I think, an officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I have a feeling that the bandleaders had to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  In the Polish army”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Polish army. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">He was at that time, when he was, after the Revolution, he was offered the freedom of joining of them forming Siberian legions of --- which he did and via the <span class="REGION">Far East</span> through <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hong Kong</span> , he went around through <span class="COUNTRY">Persia</span> , I would say, through the <span class="REGION">Persian Gulf</span> and so forth, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Suez</span> I would say and came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , in the legion. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And stayed in the Polish army till much after <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was formed and still was fighting with the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">He was in the middle of the Battle of Warsaw, the famous battle, and christened forever by that fact and had difficulties with the Soviet people because of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  What was he by vocation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  My father was a violinist. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">He was desperately trying to play in the Huberman Symphony Orchestra in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time and somehow couldn’t get out, but he was an excellent violinist. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">He was an excellent violinist but there was absolutely no making a living that way in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> for a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And he might have tried other symphony orchestras too, and he couldn’t get in; he couldn’t get out, get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">As a matter of fact, my father had an American visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">As late as 1939 a visa was waiting for him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , but not for us and not for my mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  Just for your father ...
ANSWER:  And he refused to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  Had he tried to get it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">My uncle here in <span class="REGION">California</span> got him the visa but refused get it for his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">That was the way it was done in the days past. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">The husband would come and then bring his family, but my father knew better. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">He knew the war was coming and so he didn’t go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  Now where did your father grow up? </span><span class="sentence" id="155">He was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brezany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  He was born in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brezany</span> and that’s where he grew up. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">He was the oldest of three children of my grandfather who always impressed me as an Austrian sergeant who marches through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and everybody would bow to him and that again was an old <span class="BUILDING">Austrian household</span> with a very strict father and I guess my father perpetuated this. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I think I broke the vicious cycle. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I became the democratic parent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  Your father was strict.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  My father was extremely strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I think that he realized what he was doing when he was taking his exams in pedagogy. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">He would tell me “Hmm, now I know why you always say no and never yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And I guess he had an idea he was not raising us properly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  When he spoke to you when he was being strict, did he speak to you in Polish or German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  No, only in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">We spoke Polish at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  Was he strict when it came to religious matters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">We were not religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Most westernized Jews were really once a year, one day or two days Jews, so called and that is they’d go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">My parents were keeping tradition in a modern sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">All these modern children’s holidays were maintained. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">The little community in --- maintained all the holidays and they had a Zionist organization to which I was not allowed to belong but nevertheless I was taught Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">They imported a teacher from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , a young man who taught us boys and girls Modern Hebrew and religion with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">To that extent we were Jewish, with all the holidays maintained more or less the way American Jews, those who are not Orthodox, the sort of social life centering around the <span class="BUILDING">suburban synagogue</span> , the reform temple. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">That is more or less what it was like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  How about your grandparents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  My grandparents were modern too, but a little less, because they still kept a <span class="BUILDING">kosher house</span> and I had the most miserable time to remember which knife went where and why I shouldn’t take butter with the same knife or fork. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I was just flabbergasted but to that extent they were more religious, but my grandmother did not have the wig, and again they didn’t go to, they did not, they maintained, they lit candles for Sabbath. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">We didn’t, not very much, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  Did they live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brezany</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  How did your father get to ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  Again another not very large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that nobody ever heard of. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Another accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">His army unit was sent to, this was a very big army and air force base. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I think it was the 67" -- Polish army something, and that’s where he stayed and that’s where he was discharged and he fell in love with this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">He played at that time in <span class="BUILDING">cafes</span> , and they had a French-style <span class="BUILDING">café</span> where you would sit and have coffee and eat a very fine piece of cake and listen to some nice Viennese violin playing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">QUESTION:  He was a violinist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">ANSWER:  Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And the orchestra leader.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  Oh, orchestra leader?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="496">QUESTION:  Well, their <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> had been invaded.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">ANSWER:  And vice-versa. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">The Russians, this is why, this is why, not that they so very much loved the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">They were the only ones who they could trust. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">They had nothing against the Soviets, the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Here they came and liberated them from Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Anybody would be a hero, and certainly they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And the capitalists were the only ones who knew, but didn’t know to what extent they would be persecuted. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Yes, everybody knew about the purges in the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I didn’t, but the older people did.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="855">ANSWER:  This was °43 because we had the first action in February and after that we knew that we were doomed. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">We thought at first we were designed to survive; we were going to be the museum piece. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">No, we weren’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">The final solution -- we were going to be -- and we already knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> because people were coming back and telling. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">So we knew there was no hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">So that’s the time, on that night before the final solution and that had to be September 4" or 5", one of those because my birthday is September 6" and I was already on -- waiting for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="861">We staged, we had it in plan, but now the orders were given. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">So I was given an order in the morning to go in such and such a <span class="NPIP">place</span> with a grenade and wait for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> was going to come and I was told where it was going to come, only I didn’t know how to use that grenade, and I’d seen enough cowboy movies and such type movies where I knew you had to pull something with your teeth, but which <span class="NPIP">part</span> , and what do you do with it? </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And so I went there and they were firing; we had guns -- it was an uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">We were -- I don’t know what they were shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">They were shooting Germans or Ukrainians or something and I was supposed to stand there and wait for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="866">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> never came, but an old German came -- a wee old Wehrmacht who was not involved with the Ukrainians, but he was truly helping people settle down on their march towards the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> where they were going to be taken, because they were wearing kid gloves with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">All alone, nobody was shot at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">That was one of the gimmicks. “</span><span class="sentence" id="869">Oh come on, you know you’re not going to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">You know that you’ve worked for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">You are working contingents. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">You’re all going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Just behave. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Make sure that your luggage is well labeled and --“
QUESTION:  So you were being resettled?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="875">ANSWER:  So that German intercepted me and because I was still looking at that grenade he assumed that I picked it up from the men who were lined up somewhere behind these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">And he says, “(’?) </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Leave it, don’t touch it, and give it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">Or put it down.” </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And he picked it up and, “Where are your parents?” </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And took me over -- was totally bewildered. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">A little bit later my boyfriend came. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">He says, “That’s a lost cause.” </span><span class="sentence" id="883">He was shooting (?). </span><span class="sentence" id="884">It was a lost -- we didn’t, weren’t even organized as well as they were, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="885">But it lasted. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">We burned up that whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="887">I’m told after we were taken away there was still shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">They had <span class="DLF">barricades</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="889">They died to the last person. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">There were more people like myself who went off or were directed off. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">Girls, not boys.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="892">QUESTION:  How many would you estimate were involved?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="893">ANSWER:  In the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="894">QUESTION:  Yes, and in the uprising.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="895">ANSWER:  I have no -- that you would have to check records. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">Because all I could see that one little piece, that one little <span class="DLF">street</span> , I never knew the leader, any second names. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">I knew one face, one man and suspected another, so if I was caught I could be tortured to death, I had nobody to tell on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="898">QUESTION:  Did your parents know what you were up to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="899">ANSWER:  My mother discovered in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and all she could say, “Oh, is that what you’re to us?”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="900">QUESTION:  This is after she was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="901">ANSWER:  “That’s what you were doing to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">You could have had us all killed!”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">QUESTION:  And what were your parents doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="904">ANSWER:  My mother was working in a <span class="BUILDING">sewing factory</span> , making a uniforms or parts of it, something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">My father was, I told you, a scribe in the militia, and I at that point was made into a gardener. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">We were raising our own vegetables and in the <span class="DLF">militia garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Somehow he got me released from work, my father, but my main job in the last few months was teaching younger children. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">I opened little <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="909">The boss gave me a couple of dollars, vlatiks, whatever, and it gave me, I apparently was born a teacher, the pleasure of facing a child and saying “You’ve got to know Latin and Physics, absolutely and there it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Without that you will never be accepted to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="911">And the little child translated it into, “I’m going to live!” </span><span class="sentence" id="912">So I credit myself with able to do that more than anything else; this was the greatest amount of passive resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">Of course, none of these children survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">Nobody very much younger than I survived because then they were classified as children. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">Eleven, ten, some tall, twelve, thirteen, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="916">QUESTION:  Were your parents rounded up at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="917">ANSWER:  They went. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">We were given an order -- you had a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">You either stayed in your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to be clubbed to death or to be killed there and my friend’s parents chose this. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Or you had to line up -- you were given the hour, the placement to bring your knapsack and label it, all that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="921">QUESTION:  Were you with your parents or with your boyfriend?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="922">ANSWER:  No, I was with my boyfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">I was told -- my parents left and we said we were going after you. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">They didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">We didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">We went where we were supposed to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="927">QUESTION:  So your <span class="DLF">paths</span> did not cross?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="928">ANSWER:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">Then the Germans brought me to them, my mother said, “Where have you been?” </span><span class="sentence" id="930">I didn’t tell her. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">Then I saw another girl who also came. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">I was disheveled, without anything, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="933">QUESTION:  What were you able to take with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="934">ANSWER:  Must have been the best that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">A skirt and a sweater, cold -- some shoes, possibly soap, I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">Food, maybe some bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="937">QUESTION:  Where were you taken?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="938">ANSWER:  We were taken by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , which was not even a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">retaining camp</span> , just pure and simple extermination. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">You were driven in, exterminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">So we passed the <span class="DLF">field</span> of ashes and human bones, and they were totally unabashed. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">We saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And it was at that point, and there were many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , that we started to sing all kind of songs, among them, “The International” and they were shooting onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because there were some left-wing and some Zionists -- and we were singing all kinds of songs and that was the song of our revolt, and they shot me between my thighs and I was scraped by the bullet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="943">QUESTION:  You were grazed by the bullet which was shot through -- you were in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> --
ANSWER:  Yes, yes, and so we decided to jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">We were nearing the point before we went to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="945">We knew where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">We -- there were some people -- at that point I realized there were more people in the underground, even the other factions, you know, whoever they were, and they were, uh -- I cut my skirt -- there were no slacks worn in those days, and we were going to jump through the <span class="DLF">window</span> and we saw people who were jump --
QUESTION:  Through the <span class="DLF">window</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="947">ANSWER:  Yes, you could. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">You would push -- you could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="949">QUESTION:  No <span class="DLF">window</span> , but the <span class="DLF">opening</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="950">ANSWER:  The <span class="DLF">opening</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="951">The <span class="DLF">opening</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="952">That was big enough to be pushed through and we saw -- I mean -- to let you know that you could -- see, we’ve seen bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">We’ve seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">I'll never forget the jazz musician whose song I carry in my heart and nobody to write it down, and he was shot in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">He jumped.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="956">QUESTION:  As he was jumping, he was shot?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="957">ANSWER:  Yes, and then he didn’t move, and I never heard of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">So he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And we still decided we will take a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">But there was not -- we didn’t have anything with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">We didn’t have weapons, we didn’t have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">So we asked people, “Please give us your money.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="964">QUESTION:  So you got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> successfully?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="965">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">We were standing in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and we’re asking people who were sitting there praying to God, “Never mind your prayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">We are your hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">If we survive, that <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> will live. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">We can’t; we need your money.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">QUESTION:  Oh, okay, cause I --
ANSWER:  We knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">Somebody said, “Oh, this one, this is rich so-and-so.” </span><span class="sentence" id="972">Their answer was, “We need that money to buy ourselves out.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="973">And besides —
QUESTION:  This was still in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="974">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">And then somebody said, “If you dare to come close to that <span class="DLF">window</span> we’re going to call the Ukrainian, because if you jump, they’re going to shoot through the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="976">So, we said the hell with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">At that point (End of Tape 1). </span><span class="sentence" id="978">I didn’t mind taking a chance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="979">QUESTION:  So we’re outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rail car</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="980">ANSWER:  That’s how we crossed to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> after the shooting I already had a sore and the reason which I so well remember the scene because with me were my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> friends whose names I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">I know how they perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">And I know how they perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">And because my mother fainted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="985">QUESTION:  Your parents were in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="986">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">I joined them with that German and I went with them and I managed to pass the selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">Many parents were sent off and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> and the last two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> or three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> were detached and these people went directly to the annihilator. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">But my parents passed their original inspection and were with us young people in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="990">My mother fainted and she couldn’t even go down because it was so crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">This was the first time that I opened my big mouth to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">Normally had I done this he would have let me have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">I mean physically. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">I said, “God damn it, would you get off your you-know-what and help your wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">She’s fainted.” </span><span class="sentence" id="996">And wild-eyed, he looked at me as if he was from a different world, and that’s when I recognized that that’s the end of the big father of mine and the beginning of me, the leader of that family. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">P’ve done this all along, supported them, got food for them, gave them the money that I earned. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">I was the undertaking kind of a person but now I knew if there was any decision to be made, it would have to be me because he’s just not there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="999">QUESTION:  This was a different world?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1000">ANSWER:  This was a different world, and I had to live up to it, so I went to my mother and I said, and I shook her, and I said, “No, you live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">You will live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Now you stop it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">She said, “Why did you do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Why did you wake me up? </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">I could have died.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">I said, “You don’t know yet.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And for some reason at that point when I knew I couldn’t -- we passed the point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> was much too far from wherever we could go, somebody told us where the point was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">There were many more people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">I never knew how many --
QUESTION:  Who were to escape?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1011">ANSWER:  Who were to escape -- oh, my boyfriend knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">See, my boyfriend was taken with the first action, the one that was in February, and he jumped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ; that first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in February, and he stayed with farmers and he came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">So he knew the point of -- where you could go to, uh, where there was Jewish underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">There was no point going anywhere especially not where there was a Polish underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">You had to go where we knew we had <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">The <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> amounted to <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">We did a little sabotage, but it was basically survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">Well, at that point, we said, well, let come whatever may, and once it passed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , we started believing, yes, that we are going to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1019">QUESTION:  You’re in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> that were not left there, so the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> continued?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1030">QUESTION:  Were you the only one to see this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1031">ANSWER:  No, we all saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">And we also had children removed from their parents and taken to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> in front of which was the Zyklon B gas, screaming mothers, mothers trying to go with children and some of us screaming, “No, you can have other children! </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">For the nation.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">We didn’t let them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">Some went, some stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">We were separated from them in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zukplaza</span> (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">which was in <span class="BUILDING">Lublin depot</span> and my friends volunteered themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">Call went for young ladies to work in such and such a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and all the women started beautifying themselves with the kerchiefs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Something told me, “Don’t do that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">Well, those friends of mine went and never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">That was one other ploy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">See, they didn’t have a full capacity for all these exterminations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">We had such a big transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">So they minimized it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">They used all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">They would take you part way in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and gas -- CO -- carbon monoxide or whatever in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or an exhaust or shot them.</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="1627">Before that time, a little bit before that happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> , a very strange thing occurred. </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">Because I am not an English speaking person and because my behavior was very much like that of gentiles and Wasps and because there was preconceived notion of children of

was summoned before the and I didn’t speak Yiddish -- in other words, I just didn’t fit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">The other Jewish boys and girls even at the <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="1716">ANSWER:  They had an order because each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camp</span> was known as the ouserkommando and we were ouserkommando of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1717">That’s why they are marching us there but never got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1718">That Polish soldier, I told the American. </span><span class="sentence" id="1719">I said now look, he was kind, he was helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1720">I said at least question him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1721">I was under the assumption he was going to be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1722">Because later on I did some things I shouldn’t have done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1723">Women captured a horrible, horrible overseer who’s beating, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , beating the women merciless. </span><span class="sentence" id="1724">The captain Lubetsky designed a scheme. </span><span class="sentence" id="1725">He says if I give him to the CID forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1726">With the white gloves nothing’s going to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1727">I know what we’ll going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">I have a dumb so-and-so southerner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1729">I will tell him that if this guy budges, he’s to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">I’m going to stand there and I’m going to call for him to come to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">Don’t say a word, he said to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">I said okay at first. </span><span class="sentence" id="1733">This procedure was being enacted, something drove me out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1734">I screamed, no, don’t you dare to do it and spoiled the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1735">He said why did you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1736">I says killed in battle but kill, his wife and children are standing, that’s not a revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">We are not vengeful people and that is what I would like to say to the blacks who executed a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1738">We didn’t do it, very few cases where the people got out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and killed Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1739">You would have heard about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1740">We are not vengeful people and I didn’t have it in me at that point, at least, or now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1741">I am not able to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and enjoy it, sightsee at this point because of the things that have been happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1742">I cringed when I meet Germans who are the proper age and start questioning me where from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , where am I from? </span><span class="sentence" id="1743">I see the type but beyond this ---. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1744">Never again” means don’t let it go and get to that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1745">That was before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1746">At this point I am most concerned with anti-Semitism whereas before I was concerned with all kinds of biases. </span><span class="sentence" id="1747">This type of development is taking place; I think that this is the most atrocious and vicious because it singles one particular group of people to cure all ills anywhere you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1748">You name a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where there was no anti-Semitism and no killing of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1749">So it’s much worse than blacks because they’re not being singled out all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1750">But Jews are, even in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , that never had and doesn’t have Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1751">Now I’m saying charity begins at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1752">I put all of my efforts trying to stop this vicious happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1753">That’s just the way it 1s.</span></p>
