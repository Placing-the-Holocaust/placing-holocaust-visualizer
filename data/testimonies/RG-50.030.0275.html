ANSWER:  No, I don't think. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">No, we didn't have the Yellow Star. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">We went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and all the group, the family -- my brother was there and my sister, and my father and my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Some cousins, some friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And we tried to stay all together in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And we were lucky that we would get in, that they pushed us, you know, that we were all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And we arranged to -- I don't want to make it too frightening and -- you know, I just tried to be strong now that I can talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And I don't remember when this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Everybody started and tried to arrange a corner on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and I remember that we had to choose, talking if we will stay together. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">If my parents need, we will work for them, and we should stay together. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I had some shoes, ski shoes, and some summer shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And I remember I wanted to put up the summer shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">My mother said, "Don't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Put up the good shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">You never know when you need it." </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And I was lucky enough to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with that shoe. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">For that I will tell you another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> after very hard <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I don't have to tell you that people were not very happy with each other, but screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">They were looking for a <span class="NPIP">corner</span> and my father said, "I'm not eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Let the children have the food." </span><span class="sentence" id="93">For two, three days, he didn't touch almost anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">We got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we didn't know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> 1s, but we got to a stop after three days and nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">We got out seeing only soldiers and big dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And we tried always, and we stayed together -- my father, my mother, my sister, my brother, myself, and a cousin near us. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And then a lot of men in the striped suits, they who were walking, you know, they were prisoners of the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And they started to separate us, so the men stayed together, the women together. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">We were young and we stayed near my mother and my sister, and right away when the officer came and they cut us off, thinking and being assured that we see each other later, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And then we started to march, and we got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">It was very, very horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We didn't know where we are or what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">We just -- big SS soldiers with the dogs near us. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And they took us to a <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span> , and I didn't see my mother anymore, but my sister was with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And they took us in and they told us to take everything off. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">We were very embarrassed, very young, and just couldn't do it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And we had our pocketbook, and in the pocketbooks was very important, our papers, our identities. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And I remember I had a little chain on my neck with a picture in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And we were standing there, and the SS men came with the dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And one of the SS men -- no, as matter of fact, it was not an SS man. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">It was a young girl from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> who were already the kapos. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And she said, "You don't need that," and took it off from my neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">This fell and I wanted to pick it up, this was very dear to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And then one of the soldiers with the big boots, then I looked up and there was the dog and the soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I never saw that again. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Again, but this was not so important than the identity card. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And we both looked at each other, and my sister said, "What we will do? </span><span class="sentence" id="118">What will we do without them?" </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Anyway, when we went to another <span class="NPIP">corner</span> and they started to cut our hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">They cut our hair and -- you know, it was just unbelievable one part of my hair came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">The other part of my hair came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And till I got out, my head was like that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">We don't know anything, and we just didn't know where to put our hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">We were so ashamed and embarrassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And let me not cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And then we went to another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and they gave us -- they gave us to put on, it was made from -- it was like a dress, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Gray. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I don't know what it's called in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">A sack, I don't know this in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And we were all in the same dresses, and yes, I forget to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">When we came after the <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span> , after we were cleaned and cleaned, you know, after they had -- we find our shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">It was a lot of shoes there, and my sister and I, we looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">When we left, we put them in a corner, so when we came out we saw the shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And this was lifesaving situation, you know, to have your own shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Anyway, yeah, they put us in 925, I was always near my sister and my cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We started to march, and there's hundreds of women and hundreds of people, it was incredible looks to see something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">But when we started to march mainly an SS man with a big German dog, and <span class="NPIP">outside</span> where already the other prisoners were standing in a <span class="DLF">line</span> and seeing us coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And I was marching and I was crying, and one of the people, one of the women screamed to me, "Don't cry, you cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">You cannot cry here. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">You are not supposed to cry here." </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I don't remember the face, but it was a young girl, I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">But she screamed at me, and she said, "Don't you ever do that." </span><span class="sentence" id="143">To , you know there's an expression in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And I never cried after that for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">When we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , we were looking for our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And they were already the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span> , and they said, "Move, move. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">You have to arrange yourselves." </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And we said, "Where should we move? </span><span class="sentence" id="149">We wait for our parents." "</span><span class="sentence" id="150">Your parents, what are you talking? </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Your parents are dead." </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And they showed us the <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> , and we said to them, "Are you crazy?" </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And we were so sure that they want just to give us back that we still <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they were already such a long time there. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And then we went in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and we got in our <span class="DLF">blocks</span> , you know, and we got to be arranged. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I will make it short, and then come back to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And in the beginning we were not so lucky, then we had the <span class="NPIP">place</span> on the bottom and it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">The rats and mouse and dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Then later on when they moved us, we got already on the top, and this was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">It was tolerable. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And then we stayed about like that in what do you call that? , </span><span class="sentence" id="161">a couple of weeks, till they adjusted. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">We got adjusted, and you probably know already from so many other interviews, the zahlappell, the getting up in the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">The 3 o'clock coffee and then a piece of bread and then -- you know the other stories from other people probably.</span></p>

was very impressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And then the summer in August my sister found somebody in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> a small scroll, must have been you know when the Jews put in the morning prayer. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And it was written in -- we knew Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">We learned at <span

id="293">We will go out." </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And I said to her, "Look, don't be stupid. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">People read the numbers. </span><span

id="299">They don't want the world to see us, the numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">It's impossible." </span><span class="sentence" id="301">She said, "Don't be like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Don't be like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I want to talk to you, but this we have to say and with that, we have to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And you know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Through all the troubles, all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">saunas</span> , all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> we kept it in our mouths. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">We came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with that, and we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with the shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">We said to -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> that made the transport, yeah -- how was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="308">We came back from war, and the whole lager was under -- <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And we said this is some trouble that we cannot go to our <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And it was -- first, yeah, this was once that they were hanging a girl who tried to escape, and the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had to see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">She tried to commit suicide, she cut her hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">That didn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And they hanged her, and we had to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Everybody had to watch that. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And the next day they said the orchestra is sold, they don't play anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And we knew when the orchestra is taken - 1s off, then they must take us away, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">The next day we stayed in the zahlappell in the big <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and they said we are not supposed to go back to our <span class="DLF">blocks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">We all go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And we went, we gave up our clothes; we gave up our shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">We were sitting there on the <span class="INT_SPACE">stone floor</span> , hundreds of girls, and we all started and tried to be together from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> or friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And one of the girls was singing beautifully, she was singing and then the SS men heard her sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And he asked she should sing again, and the whole <span class="DLF">block</span> , the whole group was standing on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">It was cold, it was already October, November. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">October, November. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And she was sitting there, she was singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">People were crying, and -- but, you know, we didn't think this was our end. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Somehow we didn't, you know, believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And then after a while, we had the <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span> and we started going out from the <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And we are getting our stuff back, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">We were saved, we were singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And we had to go to selection, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">So one <span class="NPIP">side</span> we carried our stuff and we are naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">In one hand, we had to be like up, and we were checked if we are clean, or we don't have some wounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">You know, things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">They were taken away right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And my sister went through, my friend went through and I came. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And when I came Mengele was on the commission, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Mengele, another doctor, another nurse, you know, were a group who selected who should stay and who should go. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">We didn't know where we go or we go, but Mengele stopped me and hold me, you know, with my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And started to turn me, he wanted to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Meanwhile, the doctor spoke to him, and he turned around to answer her. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And when he turned around, I run. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And meanwhile the others came. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Otherwise, I wouldn't tell you none of the stories, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And then it was wonderful, very, very well organized, who went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And we came and then who couldn't come and who was selected, they were put in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And we just heard the screaming: mother from daughter; sister from sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">It was a terrible, terrible frightening situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Still we were not sure that we will go. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And when we march, we saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> already there, that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And we went, the group was always tried to be together. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I'm almost finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And we went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">We sat, and everybody had his piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And everybody wanted to keep whatever they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And they were fighting with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">The girls, "I want to sit here. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I want to sit here." </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And then one SS man, it was not an SS man. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">It was a Verma (ph), a young man who came in, and who said to them, "Don't get upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Find your <span class="NPIP">place</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="364">He came and gave everyone a piece of bread with margarine, the Verma (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And he said to us, "Be quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">You don't know if you go or you're to stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">You will know you are almost safe when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> will move." </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And that made them little bit, you know, quiet waiting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> should move. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And after a while, it really moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And we went -- I don't remember how long -- we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> was a terrible situation, there was no <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> , but people were just dying and the typhoid. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I make it short, and I see it's a little bit too long.</span></p>
