QUESTION:  Where were you liberated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="826">ANSWER:  Well, then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> got too hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">The <span class="BUILDING">Siemens complex</span> was destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> was destroyed and they ferried us up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienburg concentration camp</span> , back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="829">That was already the later days of the Nazi era. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">Most people saw the light; that this was an untenable situation and the Germans were done for. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Was only a matter of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">They prepared us -- again no hardships. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">They prepared us for a march to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Meklenburg</span> , to the <span class="REGION">Meklenburg region</span> and we were supposed to board a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Red Cross ship</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> but we had to walk over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">The order came to march us into a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and to machine-gun us all to death.</span></p>
