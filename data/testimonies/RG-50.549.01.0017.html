<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  And the Dutch, just before this interview when we were talking for a couple minutes, you mentioned that it was a small percentage of the Dutch who, who actually didn’t betray Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Can you talk a little bit more about, | mean, obviously that’s how you survived, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  Was because we were not betrayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">| need to stress, |, what, what my sense about <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> during the war was based on, based on history, basically, data and in retrospect, is that there was a small percentage perhaps five, five percent, if that many who actively tried to help Jews if, I’m not sure there were that many, who were, who risked their own lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And they were truly the noble, the very noble people, because it’s hard to ask people to do that for others. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">So, about five percent perhaps that, I’m not even sure it was, were that many, that actually, actively did something. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My feeling is that 80 percent didn’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I’m not saying that they would have betrayed but also that they didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">But we had a significant, | would say fifty to twenty percent who were traitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">A huge percentage that were part of the, they belonged to the NS Bay(ph) which is the National Socialist Party, actively, who actively worked with the, with the Nazis, with the Germans and betrayed Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Most Dutch Jews probably were betrayed by Dutch rather than those were in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">| think they, they said something like 35,000 were in hiding, 15,000 were betrayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Anita Frank 4 [Date not labeled] Page 4 That’s a significant number. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Probably mostly by the Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Dutch people who got a few dollars for it, a few guilders which the Dutch thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">They got guilders so each person had a, had a monetary value attached. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> only now is coming to terms with the fact that as a, as a people, they were not, they were not all that, | hate to say this, they were not all that different from the German people in that a lot of them just turned their heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Most just turned their heads, let it happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Did you ever talk to Betty Booka(ph) about this, later?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  Oh yes, oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  What were her thoughts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  Well, she was truly one of the extraordinary heroines, a remarkable woman who, because of her background, the Quaker background, she was British, one of the Cadbury(ph) families. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">She couldn't tolerate what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">From the very beginning, she couldn't tolerate this kind of injustice and absolutely, absolutely made it part of her, her life, her commitment to save as many as she could. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And this was who she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">This was her, her mission in life and that’s what | gather, was true for most of the rescuers. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">They saw something happening that was so intolerable to them that, that they could not live with themselves and let this, let this happen to others. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And they, they, they basically did what they, they did what they did because they couldn't do anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Those are the rescuers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  How many people did she save, do you think?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Oh, she, tens | would say because, | didn't realize there were other Jewish children In the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , course we didn't know that there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">But there were others, she hid Anita Frank 9) [Date not labeled] Page 5 other Jews and helped others to hide others and there was a whole system the she and her husband Case(ph) created. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">They, they. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">there was a group of Jewish children living close by that they took care of and tried to save. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So they, throughout the war, went out of their way to, to save, to save Jewish children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  And could have died themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Oh yes, as a matter of fact, one of the terrifying stories was that, there was a, an act of sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Some, some underground, members of the underground blew up a, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with Nazi munitions and they, they took Case Booka(ph), in to, to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and they said, “unless those who had planned this act, this sabotage and who had done it, that, that Case Booka(ph) would be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And one of the, one of the, one of the perpetrators of this, of blowing up, who blew up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was a young Jewish man. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And he gave himself up. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">He did not want Case(ph) to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And he was immediately tortured and shot, this young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And he was part of the, he was in the Underground but he was Jewish, also.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  What year was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  In 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  My God.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Oh yeah, they endangered themselves, the Bookas(ph) endangered, anybody who hid Jews endangered themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And the family, it was interesting cause | just spent, as | said, we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in April, just, just a few months ago and | spent quite a bit of time with the daughters, three of the daughters of the Booka family. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And | asked them if they knew we were Jewish and you know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="50">They Anita Frank 6 [Date not labeled] Page 6 really didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">They, it wasn't discussed, it was never discussed. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">They just knew that they, that they had to help hide people. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">But it was all, it was all hidden and it was just part of their, of their ethic that they would not cooperate and collaborate with the Nazis and they would do what they could to help those in need.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  Do you think Betty and Case(ph) didn’t tell them just, to not give them information that they might betray by mistake?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Nottoimplicate. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And itwas Betty by the way, it was, in retrospect, it was Betty who insisted doing this, not Case(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="59">| don’t know, we're not even sure Case(ph) knew we were Jewish, because they took in other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">It was Betty who did it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  What kind of woman was she?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  Extraordinary, a gentle, little, beautiful, sweetest face in the world, kind, caring, concerned, loving, extraordinary woman who, who just, she couldn't do anything different. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And we stayed in close touch with her after the war and she came to visit us and whenever we went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , of course, we visited her until she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And, and the interesting thing about her is, she was so concerned about others that in some way, she neglected her own children. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">She had eight children, they had eight children themselves and, and that, you see that often in those who are truly committed to the well-being of others that, very often, there is some, you, you sort of assume your own children will manage. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">So | think, I, | think there’s some bitterness there now, among her children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  You sense that when you talk to them? </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Anita Frank 7 [Date not labeled] Page 7
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Yeah, they admired her, they loved her very much but | still have a real sense that they themselves did not probably, did not get what they needed because Betty was so concerned for, for others. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">You only have so much energy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  Did you ever see her show emotion during the war over the situation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">No, because basically we were told never to tell anybody and so, we didn't except those little lapses. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And | didn’t even know that she knew we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">| can remember, and that was, that was just the whole thing that | was so torn up about. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">| mean, we were told never to tell anybody, so as far as we were concerned, we were non-Jewish children living with these people and | had no idea who knew and who didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So | couldn't tell anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So it was that, that horrendous fear of being discovered that stayed with me and the inability to talk to anybody about it, for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So all | Knew was that we had to be there because we'd be killed but | did not know that Betty knew we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">It turned out she did but really, most others didn't, in the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Have you seen any of the other children who stayed in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Yeah, well no, that’s not true, where, as a matter of fact yes we did, | did, just In, in April. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Eric, Eric State(ph) was there, the whole time we were there, my brother and | were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Eric lived there and Eric has, he had a, | don't know, | think he had a serious illness and so he’s, he’s, almost a form of autism and he’s now, so we saw him, | saw him for the first in 50 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We visited him in his, in his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">In Julia,(ph), no it was Kondia Booka(ph) and | went to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Anita Frank 8 [Date not labeled] Page 8
QUESTION:  But your brother went with you to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Who, who did you say went with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Or did you go with your husband?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Oh with my husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Oh, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  No, no, my brother tragically just died. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">My, the, my brother with whom | was in hiding, Norman, just died April, May 28", May 29" of pancreatic cancer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, that was very sad and that was the terrifying thing of going to Europe and knowing, not knowing whether he would live. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">He didnt, he did live until we returned and we were able to be with him but now he tragically died.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  Oh boy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  You said that your, your father said your mother’s couraged, courage saved the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  Can you elaborate on that please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  It was my mother, my father admitted that he was in total despair at times and that when they were in hiding in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Falkenburg</span> , well in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> , she saved my father’s life by taking the, | talked about that on the tape, taking the Cross of Merit to the, that her father had earned in World War | to the German commander of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And who in effect excused my father from that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> where they took first, they first took the men to, totally debilitate the families. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And so she did that and then my father Anita Frank 9 [Date not labeled] Page 9 said many times that during the war, when in effect the, the police would come and when in effect they were told to produce papers that they couldn’t produce, and when in effect these threats were made of transporting us, of, of interrogating us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because they notified my parents this might happen, that my father said she, he would just be in despair and my mother just would support him and encourage him and say, “No, let's, lets go and see what we can do and lets contact Frompinksteron(ph) but be careful about it,” and she just, she just, she just is the one who, who persevered. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">She's the one who said to Pete, this policeman, “Pete, you don't want to know these questions, don't ask us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="107">| mean, she would come up, it’s almost like her intuition allowed her to do the right things at the right time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  Because that was dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Exceedingly dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">It would have been the end of it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">|, had he been with the Nazi, the NS Bay(ph), that would have been the end of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">But she took risks, somehow almost intuitively knowing what was to, at the same time, she didn't want him to continue asking because she did not want him to know this information. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So it was just amazing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  | wonder what, how he answered to his superiors when he didn’t get ...
ANSWER:  He said things are fine, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Probably went back and said things are okay, and looked at the papers and things are okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">He covered up for them, whoever this Pete was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Anita Frank 10 [Date not labeled] Page 10
ANSWER:  But then after the war, my mother suffered horrendously. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">She never recovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Then she had her nervous breakdowns and then she turned from really this, this very positive, | gathered from my cousin who still lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> who adored, who lived a year with my parents before the war, who, she just said my mother was the most loving and positive and, and, and affectionate woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">But after the war, she just, that was all. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">| can't say it was all lost, she remained very caring but she became so bitter and so unhappy and so distraught, so desperate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  Well, your family had a very difficult time in those early years right after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Terrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Economically, <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> ...
ANSWER:  Terrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  What were, besides the British censorship job, what were some of the other jobs your father did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  Well, he didn't, | think that was his first job. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We came, we were liberated in, in September, September 17°, ’44, in Lindbergh,(ph), in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Howtem(ph</span> ), we stayed and then we moved to, we moved to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where the, where the, traitor’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where he was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and the woman was forced to take us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Then in April of ’40, ’45, just before, just before the end of World War Il in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> which was May, | think it was May five, May 5", when <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">In April we went to, back to and we lived in this bombed-out <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and his first job there was with English censorship so my mother was left alone with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And then he came back from that and then he went back to the Ferda(ph) which was the, the <span class="BUILDING">clothing factory</span> <span class="BUILDING">Anita Frank 11</span> [Date not labeled] Page 11 with whom he’d worked before the war so he went back to them and then, after that, he left them and went to another clothing, worked for another clothing manufacturers, as a representative.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  A salesman?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  A salesman, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">They called them factory representatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">He would go to <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and, and, and, yeah, sell their, their line of clothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  Which probably, or was that a difficult job after the war given the, the economy of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  Yeah, it was very hard but he had some old customers who when they, who had, as a matter of fact one of his customers was very helpful to us during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">They hid some of my parents’ silver and they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lindbergh(ph</span> ), northern Lindbergh(ph), and Findlow(ph), and they were, they were very helpful to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So when my, my father again took that job, they, | think they bought from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">He was a lousy salesman. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">He, he should never have been into sales. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">But it was his whole family’s business but my father was an intellectual and he should never have been a salesperson. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">He was, hated that, wasn’t good at it, totally honest, totally ethical, totally non-pushy, totally not the characteristics of somebody who’s going to make it big in sales, exact opposite. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Oh, I’m probably insulting salespeople now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  So, in other words, those first few years, economically your family was, would you describe it as on the edge?</span></p>

ANSWER:  Well, you asked, you asked why, how, how was Hitler possible and, and | just, as | said we had answers to that, we'd know better. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">But! </span><span class="sentence" id="521">mean |, when | put in context is, is we have had two years, two thousand years, perhaps that's a little bit, no, really two thousand of unmitigated anti-Semitism in, in, in Europe, perhaps 1500. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">But, certainly, the Crusades, the, the Inquisition in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , | mean, blaming Jews for the plague. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">| mean it, all you have to do is go through European history and if you look at the Bible, this increasing anti-Semitism, this, this hatred of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">You see that developing in the Bible, it wasn't, that was not the original, the original disciples were not, they were Jews themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">But you see, as, as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> became Christian, they of course had to, to blame Jesus’ death, not on the, the, the, the Romans but they had to blame it on the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And you see this shift, this shift in the Bible itself to an increasingly more anti-Semitic perspective about Jews as Christ killers. </span><span

of Christian children. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">It becomes, they become the, the Jews, the dirty Jews, the ones, the dangerous people and then of course with the, with the Christians curtailing the Anita Frank 33 [Date not labeled] Page 33 Jewish, the Jewish, the possibility for Jews, jobs, professions and so on, were in a, in effect, Jews can only be, they could lend money because it was dirty for Christians to lend money. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">So they could do the dirty jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And then Jews become successful there,

totally consistent but it certainly was consistent over time with periods of, of, of some, of some allowance to, to let Jews live their lives and flourish. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And | must say that’s where <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> has had us, on the whole, a, a better history, not perfect but certainly a better history of tolerance for Jews because they did allow the

and, and a population which is the same as in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , this, this, a population that has as its dogma the Christian belief that if you just, the Calvinistic belief if, if you just do everything right and you follow God's word and you do it, then good things are gonna come to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And that basically, you obey. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">It’s very Anita Frank 34 [Date not labeled] Page 34 important to do what you're told, not to question this sort of authoritarian, sort of ethic of, of, of children must

of a cultural pattern of not questioning what goes on, a religious pattern of, if something bad happens to people, they deserve it. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And then a historical pattern of extreme anti-Semitism, then you ve got this great combination that when things go bad, as of course Hitler came to power after this horrendous inflation, well, first the defeat for <span

id="546">What you do is you find a scapegoat. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And Hitler, Hitler was always a rabid anti-Semite. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">But people become very vulnerable to, becoming comfortable to, yes, it’s all the Jews’ fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Blame somebody else, | mean we do it in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> all the

then to understand the Jews, the traditional scapegoat in Europe became an obvious scapegoat here. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And then with German propaganda, they did an unbelievable job

<p><span class="sentence" id="927">ANSWER:  | think he sees himself, which is to me the clue to happiness, he sees himself as being safe in this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">It’s not that the world is safe and | don't, | know the world isn't safe but | also now feel safe in this world because | know! </span><span class="sentence" id="929">can cope. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And that’s how Loren(ph) feels. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">Loren(ph) is safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">Loren(ph) is convinced that he can do what he wants to do, meaning, not in that he can do anything he wants to do but that when he sets his, when he sets his mind on accomplishing something, he will accomplish Anita Frank 995 [Date not labeled] Page 55 it. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">He’s totally inner directed, he has complete sense, internal sense of locus(ph) control. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And, and a complete belief that things will work out for him because he is safe in this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And it’s amazing, | feel safe in this world now, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">It's amazing when you feel that way, how things do go right. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And it’s not because the world is Safe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="938">QUESTION:  Right, | asked the question sort of backwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="939">ANSWER:  Yeah, no, but I, | think you’re hitting critical perspective from my, because, because we were raised, | mean we, my sisters, my brother and | were raised in this horrendously dangerous world. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">| mean the world was so unsafe for us and it remained unsafe for so many years and the clue to happiness, the clue to no, the clue to our well-being has been to be able to begin to feel safe in this, in this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And that’s not an easy transition to make because it basically means you stop looking at the outer world to become safe for you but you, you become safe within yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="942">QUESTION:  How do you do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="943">ANSWER:  Hard work. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Hard work. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">It’s, it's, as | work with people, that’s what | really try and teach them is how do you do that and, and, for me, the, the single most important clue is that when | was so unsafe and felt so defeated, | let the whole world define me. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">Itwas Anita who had to be this perfect, obedient, good, accepting, non-creative basically, because if | did anything creative, my goodness, it might annoy people so this trapped in a, in a box person who tried to please everybody and tried to avoid making anybody mad so that at least | would get positive input from others. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">| mean going back to Elizabeth Dixon is, she, | had to translate that at least she values me. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">Anita Frank 56 [Date not labeled] Page 56 Well, if she values me, there must be some value to me ‘cause | didn’t feel it. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">So it is stopping that, it’s stopping looking to others to make you feel safe and begin to really get to Know yourself and define yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">It’s at self-definition. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">It's knowing who you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Its Knowing your strengths, knowing your weaknesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">It is when people are mad at you, it's not to say oh my gosh, I'm a bad person but to say, oh, you're mad atme. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Well, who's problem is it? </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Is it your problem, is it really something I've done? </span><span class="sentence" id="956">If it’s something I’ve done, that’s something | can learn from. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">What do | need to, | need to work on changing that so it’s not closing myself off from others, it’s remaining open to the input that others give me but at a very, on a very limited basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">Because | recognize that everybody else is probably crazier than | am and to let other people define me, hah! </span><span class="sentence" id="959">What a joke that is. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">| mean we, the Nazis defined us as dirty, filthy Jews worthy of extermination. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">No one will ever define me again. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">So it’s partly again, it’s a reaction to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">Nobody will define me. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">| will define myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">But within the context of my environment so to avoid becoming this extreme narcissist, you, you want to remain open to input but you want to weigh it against what you know about yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">That’s, and this way you keep on growing and the, and the most wonderful thing is the more at peace you are with yourself, the nicer you can be to other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">You don't, cause you don't have to destroy others to feel good about yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Asa matter of fact, it hurts you to be negative or destructive to others and so you know that those who are destructive, there’s something wrong with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">Because if you truly feel good about yourself, you don’t, you don’t want to hurt others, cause it hurts you if you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">https://collections.ushmm.org Anita Frank of [Date not labeled] Page 57
QUESTION:  Did you ever go through any psychotherapy and examine these kinds of issues?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">ANSWER:  Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">I’ve done a lot of it, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="973">QUESTION:  And you married the man who is in the <span class="DLF">field</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="974">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Who never psychoanalyzed me, ever, ever, ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">Whose greatest gift to me | still think is to basically say, Anita you’ve gotta go take care of yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And Anita thought, okay, | don’t particularly like that but that makes a lot of sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And who said, okay, I’m gonna do this and that has been Alan’s lack of control over me and lack of need to, to have me be a particular way but whose support for me, for myself, whoever | wanted to become was always there. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">Was just my, has been my perfect partner. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">Absolutely perfect partner. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">| don’t think | would be the person | am now without sort of having, without having been with that person who was so wonderful about letting me be who | basically had a potential to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">Was nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="983">QUESTION:  Sounds great.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="984">ANSWER:  Itis. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Its wonderful, it’s rare. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">It’s so rare.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="987">QUESTION:  And even more rare probably for people in their fifties and, and in terms of man being that way...
ANSWER:  Oh yes, and particularly for a psychiatrist. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">My goodness, after all they know how the world works. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">As far as he was concerned, he didn’t and it was up to me to figure it out for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">And |, what is interesting in my work with people, I’ve learned a lot from working with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">They have been my teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">Right now | work at the <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="993">| have a wonderful job at the <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> but when | worked with Anita Frank 58 [Date not labeled] Page 58 patients, | learned from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And | learned what not to do and I, I, | integrated and incorporated all those ideas in my own, in my own behavior.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="995">QUESTION:  And that’s when you were counseling?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="996">ANSWER:  Yeah, then |, for years | did counseling. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">My way. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">Never anybody else’s way, always my way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="999">QUESTION:  What does that mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">What rules did you break?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1001">ANSWER:  Oh, | broke all the rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">| broke every rule and that is that the classic rules of counseling are that all these worries about transference and counter-transference and all this other garbage and how you need to let the patient come up with all the solutions and how you don't insert yourself into it and how you don't, all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">| broke every single one of those rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">And what | basically, what I, the way | perceived it, it was more reeducating people, the way | had to reeducate myself and that is to help people to begin to define, learn how to define themselves and, and begin to appreciate themselves and how, how to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">I’ve got a whole schema for doing that and, and | would come up with ideas but always in such a way that | would say look. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">I’m just gonna share these with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">These are tools. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">It, everything is in your control. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">Everything is within your power so always leave you the power and leave in the control with, with my clients. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">And as a result, | could develop very equal relationships and people never saw me as telling what to do but it was a sharing which was super healing. _ </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">It, it just, and it was amazing how quickly people, not everybody but an overwhelming majority were able to just begin to look at their life from a different perspective and learn different ways of dealing with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">Anita Frank 59 [Date not labeled] Page 59
QUESTION:  So in other words, you didn’t exercise that power that the authority figure or expert has?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1013">ANSWER:  Exactly, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">| was never the expert. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">| always let them know they were the expert. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">All that | had were some tools and some ideas that | was willing to share with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">But they had to tell me whether they fit it, they might not, and | would tell them, look, this may not be right for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">Let me know, you know better than | do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">If we talk about something that, that you don’t, you find offensive, let me know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">So that it was, | was, I’ve never been the expert. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">| mean, and I, in my work at the <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , |’m trying to teach our medical students, that as future physicians, it’s still the patient who is the expert on the patient.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1022">QUESTION:  That’s novel.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1023">ANSWER:  It's not the physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">The physician may be the expert on the disease and on some treatment but the patient is the expert on, on what's wrong with the patient and if you don’t respect that and don't elicit from the patient what's going on and what they think what’s going on, you're gonna lose three quarters of your information. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And particularly true in management of illness is that, always three quarters of that is within the patient's domain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">Because | can't prescribe, | mean, that’s why | will tell with my clients, | mean | can suggest that you might try this but it’s up to you to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">Now is this going to be possible for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">And some of them will say, yes and | say well, how do you see yourself doing this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">It’s letting always your clients come up with a plan, always have them, have them come up with the ideas as much as possible about what’s gonna work for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">And have them be in charge of their own healing Anita Frank 60 [Date not labeled] Page 60 because only then is there gonna be a chance that they will actually pursue the ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">But if | tell somebody else what to do, the chance of ‘em doing it are very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">It shouldn't, and so to that, and, but where | differ from classic counseling is that | will come up with, | will say, | won't say a lot of counseling is how do you feel about this, how do you feel about this, how do you feel about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">|, like you feel about it is only marginally useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">| much more focus, okay, what are you gonna do about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">I’m much more focused End of Tape 2. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">https://collections.ushmm.org Anita Frank 61 [Date not labeled] Page 61 Tape 3
ANSWER:  Well, it’s, it's going back to, to my, my the difference is that, and that, that has, that goes back to my history is you need to understand how your past has impacted on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">That's critical because otherwise you remain a victim of your past. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">But then you need to free yourself from your past as much as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Now, | won't ever be able to free myself completely and that’s okay because | should never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">But what | can do and what also my clients mostly need to do is they need to overcome the horrendous messages of their childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">They need to take control over their lives and so | prefer focusing on the healing process instead of on the, just on the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1042">QUESTION:  And, and it worked for you ...
ANSWER:  Exactly right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1043">QUESTION:  And you've seen it work for your patients as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1044">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">It works unbelievably well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">Unbelievably well with my clients.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1047">QUESTION:  And what is the actual class that you teach, at, is it U and M Medical?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1048">ANSWER:  | don't teach, | don't teach classes necessarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">| teach on the behavioral scientists for the, we have a problem-based learning curriculum at our <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1050">QUESTION:  A what based?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1051">ANSWER:  Problem-based learning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">It basically means that they have, it’s a modified problem-based learning so they meet in tutorial groups and there is a lot of responsibility for self learning, for hypothesizing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">| mean all the things, all the things Anita Frank 62 [Date not labeled] Page 62 that | think are important, thinking, problem-solving, analyzing and my job as the behavioral scientist, | see as my major job is to, to teach our medical students to see patients at the partners, as their partners and not as diseases because <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> is heavily biological and so our, our physicians are trained to look at the disease process and at very little else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">And so my major job is to keep the patient in mind, and to keep the patient as the focus and to deal with the patient as a partner and not just as the carrier of a disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">And it’s very exciting and, and I’m particularly interested in the management treatment part of it where basically the patient should, we should have very different approaches. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">Physicians have a tendency to tell patients what to do, this is what you should, without explaining much, without looking at a patient’s circumstances to see whether in effect they can one, buy the medicine, take, take the medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">Can they relax, can they adhere, do they understand what's going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">What are the pressures, what are the miseries, what are the situations at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">| mean, you can tell somebody to stop smoking, well, that’s not gonna to do a bit of good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">You need to understand what role smoking plays in this, this person’s life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">And are they interested in quitting? </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">And where are they and how often have they tried? </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">So, it’s a, its a much of a comprehensive, patient-centered approach. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">Very respectful of the patient.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1065">QUESTION:  Sounds awfully new to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1066">ANSWER:  That's what most people say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">But that’s what we are, we hope to accomplish at our <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> and we're succeeding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">Our, our young, our medical students are Anita Frank 63 [Date not labeled] Page 63 wonderful, wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">Not all, but most. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">And very tuned into this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">It’s really, it’s wonderful to talk with them and, and see their sensitivity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1072">QUESTION:  How old or new is this program?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1073">ANSWER:  We're going in our fourth year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">So. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">We're having our fourth class. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">Our, our first class is graduating next year and they're sort of my babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">They’re, | came in with them and they're, I’m gonna miss ‘em a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1078">QUESTION:  It’s exciting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1079">ANSWER:  Itis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">They’re wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">It’s a great <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1082">QUESTION:  It also sounds good on the level that | interviewed a doctor for a story | was working on recently and he said, “People don't realize how prone physicians are to problems; drug problems, stress, enormous, enormous stress.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">So it sounds like perhaps this gives them some tools to work on their problems too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1084">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">Verynice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">Because we expect physicians to be super-human. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">And they're just people, bright people on the whole, and caring people on the whole. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">But that’s all they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">And one of the great tragedies is is that in the traditional approach, our physicians are taught, it becomes, because they tend to be obsessive- compulsive, they tend to be perfectionists, they tend to be hard-driven and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">What they want to do is they want to fix things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">And they're happy when they can fix something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">And when they can't fix something, they get very unhappy and very stressed and so what happens very often is that, particularly during the dying process when they can’t do anymore for a patient, they abandon the patient. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">Because they cant do anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">And so you see this avoidance behavior. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">That's because Anita Frank 64 [Date not labeled] Page 64 they're uncomfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">They can't, they can't fix, the other focus for me is is that there is very little fixing you guys can do. _ </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">If you’re lucky you can cut out a, you can cure a bacterial illness with some antibiotics and you can cut out a cancer and you can do, you can do some other things that truly fix things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">But most of the time, it isn’t as simple as that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">Most of the time you just have to learn to work with your patient to make it as, to make it better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">But that means you need to be in partnership with your patient. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">And don’t worry so much about fixing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1103">QUESTION:  And, and don’t take all the responsibility.</span></p>

Nazis, these Nazi scientists, Gunter(ph), what is it, Gunter von Braun(ph), that was the guy, to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and, and to work on the weapons programs here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1708">And we've hidden, | mean, we still, we’re discovering Nazis left and right still. </span><span class="sentence" id="1709">It’s pretty late now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1710">So | think this, and of course the, the horror of not letting the Jews and the, they, they, the ones who left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> | think or Bramen(ph) on the, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> and they were refused entry here and had to go back to an, to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or taken to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1711">So, this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> has no, has not an unblemished record, far from it in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1712">And that is | think, true in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1713">|, |, | think there isn’t, <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> perhaps, <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> really had a small number of Jews and they, the king as a leader, behaved nobly and its population followed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1714">They, as a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , get a lot of credit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1715">And, and I, | expect the, | accept the fact that we all make mistakes but what! </span><span class="sentence" id="1716">cannot accept is that we don't acknowledge our mistakes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1717">| think one of the great blessings of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is, is we, we allow, we encourage ourselves to examine our past and our policies and our history and we, there is a lot of self-criticism going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1718">And there is a lot of, we have a lot of controversy and we have a lot of people who have courage to examine the past and to look at the past and to say this is where we went wrong or this is where we didnt behave appropriately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1719">And one of the things that has been so missing in Europe has been that honest self-examination. </span><span class="sentence" id="1720">And, and you even know it, you go to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">war museum</span> and the, the, the kind of sickening chauvinism of the French Anita Frank 95 [Date not labeled] Page 95 is just enough to, to appall anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1721">And that is a, if you look at their <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , it’s as if Charles de Gaulle(ph) won the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1722">There is absolutely nothing about French treachery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1723">There's nothing about French cooperation with the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1724">There's nothing about the police’s happy cooperation, rounding of the Jews and betraying Jews, there is nothing of that in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1725">Only now are they coming to terms with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1726">In <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> also, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> is better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1727">It's now beginning to examine its past but it’s taken them so long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">For the longest time <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> had this, whenever | talked about <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> not having been so, such a glorious <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> during the war, people said surprised, “Oh, | thought they were so noble.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1729">Cause <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> fostered that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">We the noble Dutch, we resisted the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">Well they didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">Some did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1733">Butno whole population can take credit for the enormous courage of a few and, and so, to me, one of the great poisonous, and, and | must admit | think that’s where <span class="REGION">western Germany</span> has, has done a relatively good job is they have a significant number of people who, who are aware of how vital it's been to examine their past. </span><span class="sentence" id="1734">But overall, it’s taken them a long time, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1735">And where in <span class="REGION">eastern Germany</span> , this hasn't happened at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1736">And where you see these, these fascist movements rising. </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">You see it in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , you see it in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1738">It’s, it's scary to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1739">And so, from my perspective that’s something that we never must stop doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1740">We need to always reexamine our past. </span><span class="sentence" id="1741">We need to learn from history and we need to be critical of ourselves and we need to learn and | applaud this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that, that looks at itself and says, you know what, that stank. </span><span class="sentence" id="1742">That was no good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1743">Many of us, it takes along while to change, but this is, this is a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that we had McCarthy, that fascist in the fifties, Joseph McCarthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1744">Anita Frank 96 [Date not labeled] Page 96 Eventually, he was brought down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1745">Eventually, we had people of courage who, who brought him down even while this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1746">And we need to make sure that we never give rise to other fascists like him who will happily destroy whole people because of this irrational fear of, then it was Communism, infiltration of the Red Menace, and it’s just, it's just dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1747">And so allowing dissent and allowing disagreement and examining ourselves all the time, | think is what’s gonna keep this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> on a reasonably healthy path.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1748">QUESTION:  And at least acceptance that terrible persecution has occurred and recognizing that that was a mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1749">ANSWER:  Oh, oh you mean in its own history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1750">Oh sure, | mean slavery and the Japanese. </span><span class="sentence" id="1751">Yes, | mean terrible, terrible things have happened in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1752">Without question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1753">And, and but the critical, it wouldn't, that would be even worse if we didn't acknowledge our horrendous mistakes and try to make sure that those things don't happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1754">And that doesn't mean that we're not gonna continue to have misery and racism because I’m not that optimistic about people to be very honest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1755">I'm just not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1756">But | think that’s where our government needs to take strong stands about people's individual rights and privileges and responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1757">QUESTION:  Does it scare you at all when you see some of the recent terrorist bombings of say the Olympics and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airliner</span> and so on that then civil liberties will be curbed to try to protect the population at large? </span><span class="sentence" id="1758">Are there any possible innocent victims?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1759">ANSWER:  Yeah, that’s such a interesting question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1760">To be honest, | see no infringement of my rights if there’re gonna be tracers in these fertilizer things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1761">That, as far as I’m Anita Frank 97 [Date not labeled] Page 97 concerned, is only sensible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1762">And to put taps on phones of suspected terrorists, that doesn't, we can exaggerate those potential dangers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1763">And that's something that really bothers me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1764">You can look at everything and, and make a huge case out of it and say what ff, if, if, yes and as a result you can immobilize people to do absolutely nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1765">And so | think we need to be at all times careful that we, that we preserve our liberties but there’s also something like the common good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1766">And we must at all times weigh the common good against the protection of individual liberties. </span><span class="sentence" id="1767">And | don't think it’s just a one-way street. </span><span class="sentence" id="1768">I, | have a firm commitment to the common good, also, and to my, in my opinion, and that’s why with gun-control, | am so strongly for gun-control. </span><span class="sentence" id="1769">| just, just that, this society is so violent and you see it, you see these 12 year old killing each other and killing others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1770">It’s just, it's insanity to, to scream about, from my perspective, about everybody’s right to, to bear guns versus the, the community’s rights to some, to a sense of safety. </span><span class="sentence" id="1771">So again, a balance never, | see that generally is the answer to most of life’s problems is to find a balance that takes into account both the common and individual rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1772">QUESTION:  And that will be continued forever, all those discussions of balance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1773">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1774">QUESTION:  Thank you, Anita, it was really fascinating to hear you talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1775">Really appreciate it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1776">ANSWER:  Just shows what a blabbermouth | am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1777">Conclusion of interview. </span>
