<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION: Tell me about what happened when the Nazis...what happened when the war broke out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER: I mean, they were talking about the war; and my father's concern was only that they're gonna take my brother--who is older than I am--and...and he's gonna get killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">That was the only concern. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I mean, we didn't have a concern what's gonna happen, or the faintest idea what's gonna happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And I...1 asked my mother, "Usually, how does a war really look? </span><span class="sentence" id="37">What happens?" </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And she told me her experience from the first world war. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">She said they were fighting near the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">They brought up the wounded to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And everybody sit in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they didn't go.... And that was the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">But it wasn't like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">The first Friday when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> declared war, they bombed our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I remember we got ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">We...my father brought a few sacks of flour <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and...and...and oil and sugar and tea and whatever; and we stacked it up all in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And they figured, "We're gonna stay here until the war is over, so at least we'll have food;" because they didn't know how it's gonna turn out. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">But it wasn't like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">On Friday, when the...<span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> crossed the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> ...they declared war and they crossed the <span class="DLF">German border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Right away, they bombed our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">My father came running <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from his business and he said, "It's very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">It's very bad." </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And we ran all to the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And I remembered the...the corn. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">The <span class="DLF">fields</span> were cut already, because when was in...in...September. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And I got my...feet got all scratched up and hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And then we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and it quiet down. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And a few days later the Russians came to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Not the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Because they made some kind of an agreement that the Russians will take this part, because we were so close to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Bug</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Maybe a week later, the Russians came and things weren't too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">My father conducted his business again. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And the Russian...being my father had...uh...had a wholesale from flour for the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> , the Russians took over one of the <span class="BUILDING">bakeries</span> that my father supplied; and the officer came to sleep to us, you know, in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And then came all of a sudden an order that they made some kind of a pact that the Russians should go back and the Germans would come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And he insisted and he begged my father to take his children and to go with the Russian army to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="66">You know," he said, "the Germans are going to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">They...they're gonna do awful things to you." </span><span class="sentence" id="68">They knew, but we didn't. "</span><span class="sentence" id="69">And you have young children. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">They can go there in to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">They can study, and they can work, and you'll be alright." </span><span class="sentence" id="72">My father and my mother thought, "Here...here we have our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">We have our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">We have our things. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We have our Passover dishes. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We have these things." </span><span class="sentence" id="77">You know, at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And we didn't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">My father didn't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">He said, "I didn't do nothing wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Why should I run?" </span><span class="sentence" id="82">You know, people who belong to the communist party or whatever, they ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">But we didn't have... my father said he doesn't have a reason why to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">He didn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And then the Germans took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And when the first unit of Gestapo came into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , they rounded up all the professionals, all the rich people, all the well-known people, all not-so-rich people, quite a few hundred...and they marched them out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">My brother went with my father, to be with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">They marched him out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in the...in the direction of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hrubieszow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">That was where... <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hrubieszow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And on the way they shot them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">One by one. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">They couldn't walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">They walked for a few days; and they shot my father, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">My brother pretended to be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And after they left, he had a wounded foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">He got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Be ec</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">All the way...that's past <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hrubieszow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Be ec</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And he hid there by a family, and got word to us that he's there. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">My mother went and brought him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We nursed him, and he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">That's how I lost my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">In 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">He was 41 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And my mother, when they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> , we...we were...we kept my mother with us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedliszcze</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">We used to hide her during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">In the evening, she came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedliszcze</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , we could go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">They made like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ...like a section we could come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">In the morning we went again so we...we succeeded in keeping our mother from '40...late '40 until '42, until they took us to Staw[-Nowosiolki, NB: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin district</span> ].</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION: Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Let's...let's...uh...I yust a little confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Let's go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Che _m</span> and to you before we move on to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Tell me what you did when you were still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Che_m</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER: Uh...During the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION: During the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER: Yeah, I...] was the only. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I had to help out. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">We had a little money and we had things that my father accumulated and we lived on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We didn't live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> yet so we lived in our own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">My mother and I, we used to do little bit knitting and sew and make a little bit money with it, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="123">That's the only thing my mother knew how to do is to knit very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So she used to knit for the Polish people, for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">They used to give her sugar for it, eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And then we could exchange this for other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So things weren't too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And then I had two Polish families who were customers, my father's customers. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And they really came forward with helping us, while we were.... One wife, one baker who had the <span class="BUILDING">bakery shop</span> , you know, <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> .... She used to put everyday behind the <span class="DLF">fence</span> where they had the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> , a loaf of bread and a bag of coal--they used to bake with the wood and the coal--and a little bag with the flour, every day, and we picked it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">That was a fortune, because half we sold and could buy other things and half we used for ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And then we had another one who later saved our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">He used to help us out also a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">He was very upset that they killed my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">He said, "If they killed your father, they took my luck away." </span><span class="sentence" id="135">He believed so strongly in my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We were very closely friends with this one. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">The children were close. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">The parents were close. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">We didn't...my...he didn't do nothing with...there goes back a story, which I'll get back to it later, how that relationship started. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">But he helped us survive, too; which was much easier than other families because if they had businesses and they had goods and that, they had to give up everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">You had to give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">You had to give up if you any forks...you had to give up if you had any silver, you had to give up if you had any gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And the money was worthless. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So the only way you could survive if you had something to exchange.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION: So they helped you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER: Oh, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION: When did it start?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER: Go ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION: When did it start to get very bad? </span><span class="sentence" id="151">What happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  It started to get very bad the beginning of '41, when they made the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">They made the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ; and all of a sudden they...uh...decided that all the Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> have to move into one <span class="REGION">section</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And they had to leave...we had to leave, like in a couple of hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">You could take only what you could take on your...back or in your hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And they put us in with a woman with six children, in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And my mother wasn't a well woman, all those years that I can remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And she couldn't..the poor woman couldn't sleep and she couldn't...and she says, "I cannot stand it in..." You know, with my father gone, she lost a lot of will to live, I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And we decided, being we had family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedliszcze</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">At that time it wasn't a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">It was just a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So they let us know that we should come there. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">There's no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And we could stay there with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">There's plenty. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So we packed up and we went, and we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Che _m</span> and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedliszce</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And there, 1t wasn't so bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">My brother worked in the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> , you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And if he worked night shift, he used to steal some flour and some...uh... what's it called? </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Cream of wheat. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="172">He used to put it in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> behind the milk, and I used to go and pick it up at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And it wasn't too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Once in awhile the gendarmerie--not the real Gestapo--used to come, and they would rob and they would steal. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">They would take away whatever you had, but you could live. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And we stayed there until...and then they made the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedliszcze</span> , and again a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So we moved in also with an old lady in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">But at that time I guess my mother got used to the conditions, and I guess the circumstances made her stronger and healthier, that she could go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I don't know how, but she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And we stayed...we used to go both to work, my brother and I. And she remained at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">In the evening she came out and we were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">In the morning, the same thing; and that... that almost a year we were there with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And then we heard that in May of 1942, they started with the Judenrein, you know, all of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I don't know about Europe, but I, ah...<span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION: Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Do you mean Judenrat or Judenrein?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER: Judenrein. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Judenrein. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Judenrats, they were all over in the meanwhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Judenrein. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And my aunt...and we knew that we're not gonna stay too much longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So my mother's sisters from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Che_m</span> , which remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Che m</span> , let us know if they should take us young--like my brother and myself--to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , Mom should come to them, because they believed they're gonna be there over the winter and maybe.... So we left my mother... and all of a sudden one morning, you know, they didn't warn you or they didn't prepare you, one morning you're going away. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So we packed up whatever we could, and my mother we hid; and she said at night she will go out, and she'll find a way to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Che m</span> back to be with the family-- because they told us that no older people...older people...she was probably 40 or 41 cannot go...just young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">The people who worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedliszcze</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So my brother and I left, and it seems that my mother couldn't get in touch with her sisters because in the meanwhile they took them. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">They took everybody at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And she got tired of sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">That we found out after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Somebody who survived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedliszcze</span> , that she went over to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> and ask them they should shoot her and they shot her. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">That was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">We didn't find out 'til after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And my brother and I, we started our march from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedliszcze</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We didn't know, but it was to start in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nowosiolki</span> , what I told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And I had a bundle and I grabbed whatever I could...new things and old things, because we felt... my mother said, "Take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Maybe you'll be able to exchange for some...."

<p><span class="sentence" id="394">QUESTION: Tell me about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">ANSWER: You see and then...in March, I think, Himmler came to visit the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ; and at that time they brought 400 young girls from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> , to show him how efficient and good they are at killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And I remember...and that's the first time when they started to shave the hair by those people...by the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And when Himmler came...and there was a rumor, you know...the SS people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> always like--through a word, you know, either when they were drunk or whatever...they said a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Then you put two together, and you made out something of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="400">You didn't answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">You pretended you don't hear, but sometimes....

They took us out and in order not to let us think, you know, when we had let's say a half hour off, they would exercise with us in such manner that you could drop dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And if you didn't do it, they shoot...shot you, if you didn't continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I remember once the cook, he couldn't keep up. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">He was old. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">If I was 18, 19, he was 40. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">So he was old...or 38, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">He couldn't keep up. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So they took him out and they beat him so badly, Frenzel, that you couldn't tell his face or head. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">His nose from his eyes was just one ball of blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">That was their pleasure. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And when you talk to them today, everybody followed orders and whatever they did wasn't wrong, even. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Wasn't their fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And that hurts. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">It hurts. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">When I went all those times to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I was afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Every middle-aged man or older man I saw, I saw him in a Nazi uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I don't trust them, and I don't believe in them that they changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I said it at the trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">If Frenzel would have a chance to wear a uniform, he would do it all over again; but maybe he would make sure now that we wouldn't escape to tell the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="694">QUESTION: Tell us about the escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">How did you even begin to plan?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER: We planned constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And I think that kept us going. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">If we would know this is it, why should go on? </span><span class="sentence" id="699">To see another 10,000 Jews come and be killed, another 20,000 be killed? </span><span class="sentence" id="700">That was not...that we wanted to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">We had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Then after awhile you become so numb that you just...you don't react, you...you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And then, we felt we're next in <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">Everybody from us had a death sentence tn their pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">It just was a matter of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">But, we never gave up that hope to...for revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And I think that kept us going. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">If we had a miserable day, when they kill...like Wagner. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">He decided to build a Strafskommando [NB: Strafkommando; "punishment brigade"]. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">| You know what "Strafskommando" means? "</span><span class="sentence" id="712">Strafskommando" means...uh..."Strafs" is "guilty." </span><span class="sentence" id="713">A "guilty unit" from whoever didn't walk straight or didn't look him right, maybe, in the eye, he put them to...to a special unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And they had to work everything while running, not walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">That was the "Strafs." </span><span class="sentence" id="716">How long can you run? </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And they get...and their ration was cut in half. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">So we didn't get enough to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">You barely could survive; but if this was cut in half... And...and every day somebody else was shot, and was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And, you know, it was so terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And every evening they gave us an explanation. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">He didn't run fast enough, so they had to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And you know what builds up in you when you listen to those words. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">It's just...1 don't know where we got the strength not to react right away, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">But we...we knew if we wanna plan an escape and if we wanna do it, we have to keep cool...keep our cool. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">We constantly...we planned maybe this way, maybe only part of us, and maybe.... And then after it happened with the Waldhofskommando [NB: Waldkommando], where they killed 24 instead of 12, and when they two more of us escaped and they took every 10th one, we felt it's not right that one should escape and leave all the others to the mercy of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">If there's gonna be an escape, everybody has to be given the chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Not everybody will know until the last day, because you had to be very careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">You ...you understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="730">So when Leon started planning this way and that way and that way and this way.... And we didn't know what's going on <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">We didn't know how far the war is and where the Russians are; because there was another thing if you get out, which we didn't think we will. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">But we felt if they'll waste some bullets and kill us in the back, it would also be a revenge not to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="733">So then one day we saw marching in a Russian unit of POWs. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">They took them out to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">In the meanwhile they expanded the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">They...they made <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp 4</span> , where they used to store ammunition because they started to prepare for the Bug...for the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Bug</span> ...for the offensive in the spring, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And we saw...and those Russians came in, and we figured, "Why did they bring Russians here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="738">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="739">In the evening you started talking and one said...turned out that they're all Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">They are POWs, but they're Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And after a couple of days, Leon started to approach them, and talk to them; and we told them everything what's going on here. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">They didn't know either. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">They didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And they had the military know-how which we didn't have, you know; and they came in from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and told us what's going on on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="745">We needed that encouragement, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">It did us a lot of good to have somebody with military know- how, with...supporting our ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And we started organizing, and after they came in and the plan was worked out that everybody at his <span class="NPIP">place</span> at work--usually wherever we worked, there was an SS man watching and a few Ukrainians--everybody at his place of work has to kill his SS and his Ukrainian at the same time, the same minute also. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">So we organized and we prepared knives, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And.... Huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">QUESTION: How’
ANSWER: In the...in the <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> where they used to make the...you know, Schlosserei [Translation: "workshop" (German)].... I'll come to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">They...they used to make...they made the knives and they gave everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Then everybody had to have pockets full of sand. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">We realized if you throw sand in somebody's eyes, he grabs his eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">When he grabs his eyes, you can stick a knife in him. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Very simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">We didn't have no weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And we figured we have to make the es...plan the escape for a time when Wagner is not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="758">We knew their schedule with vacations. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">We knew that they're six weeks there or four weeks and then they go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And if those went away, the next...these go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And we figured because Wagner was very smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Not smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">He could tell what you think, not what you do. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">That's how devoted Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Very devoted Nazi! </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And that was 26 days, after the Russian unit came. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And we decided for October the 13th to make the escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Only a small group knew of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I knew every day what's going on, what has decided, how it's gonna be, what we're gonna do. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">The plan was that everybody kills his Nazi at his place of work and puts him away where nobody can see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And if we have all of them dead...then we'll assemble like roll call, assemble, and we'll walk to the weapon area. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">We'll take out some weapons, and we'll walk out through the main <span class="DLF">gate</span> ; because there was no <span class="DLF">mines</span> at the main <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And we'll go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">It was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">That was our luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And we'll form a partisan group. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">So and...we had to cut the electricity...the electric wires, the telephone wires.... You know, all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And on the night of the 12th, you know, everybody got ready; but nobody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Maybe 20 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">I was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Because we had...some people as it turned out later got so panicky, you know; just the thought of the revenge was so great and...and some people didn't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">They gave up. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">So, maybe 20 knew; and we went...and we decided, next day 4 o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I mean we didn't have to pack our luggage to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">You...you understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Next day, we were all ready; and then a few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> of SS people came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="787">They never came. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">This time, they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And you know, we were shivering. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">We thought maybe something leaked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And they went into the <span class="BUILDING">casino</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="792">That was their... uh...<span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">They called it "<span class="BUILDING">casino</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And they had a good meal there. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And we had to postpone. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Postpone.

<p><span class="sentence" id="1055">QUESTION: Tell me about liberation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1056">ANSWER: A few days before the liberation...[ mean, it was such a fancy <span class="DLF">farm</span> and it had a <span class="DLF">wooden fence</span> around; he was a very wealthy man in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">And over there, only his old mother lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">He used to take care of the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , but he didn't live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">And the mother was senile, already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">And that was our luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">Even if she would see us...once she saw me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">I walked down in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , you know, to stretch out my legs and she asked me, "Why...why you walking here? </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">There's a war in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">I said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">I just came to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">I'm going back." </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">And a few days before...you know, we were already exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">My brother was there 19 months, and I was already 9 months, without a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , a spoon of warm water all those 9 months, without cooked food because he didn't live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">He couldn't cook for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">Only he gave us enough bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">And water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">Sometimes a little jam, a little margarine, you know, or something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">He gave us plenty of onions and plenty of garlic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">And I think that helped us, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">And it was already the last days and all of a sudden we...and he told us that he built a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">He owned a piece of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> past the <span class="DLF">farms</span> , a little further down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">He said, "If you have a chance, run out from the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , because the Germans are retreating and they're burning everything to ground, livestock and everything." </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">So we said, "Okay." </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">And as we got ready... ready...whatever we have to..you know...all of a sudden... yeah...before, the Germans came and set up <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> in our <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">And we are sitting and looking at them, you know, through the boards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">And two officers started cleaning their weapons and one shot the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">I didn't know if it's on...on purpose or accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And they set up a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">And I said, "That's what we need. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">Exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">The last day." </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">And in the meanwhile came an order that they have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">And they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">So we survived this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">The next day, all of a sudden, we figured soon it'll get dark...we'll go out in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> because the corn and everything was very high already....
