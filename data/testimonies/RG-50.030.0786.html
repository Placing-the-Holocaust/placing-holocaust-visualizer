<p><span class="sentence" id="1072">ANSWER:  So, Mira and I have the same mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">My mother met my father in that whole turmoil during World War II, after he was released from the prisoner of war camp, and she and Mira were released from — well, they escaped actually, from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">And it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tatishchevo</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saratov</span> , where was the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish army camp</span> that was being gathered from all the soldiers that had remained, that hadn't been murdered in the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">So they met there briefly, and they actually met again later on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jelibod(ph</span> ), which was in <span class="COUNTRY">Uzbekistan</span> , or I don’t know, it’s on the <span class="DLF">border</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tashkins(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="1076"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tashkins(ph</span> ) was another <span class="REGION">area</span> where the Polish army had gone, and this is maybe 1500 miles or more away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tatishchevo</span> , or near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saratov</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1077">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">So I would like to — for us to trace. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">I mean, some of the things that I asked Mira, she didn’t remember where she wa — you know, what the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> were, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">And tell me, how is it that you know all of these <span class="NPIP">places</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1081">ANSWER:  Well, my mother talked about these experiences the whole time I was growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">And they were rather in disjointed sequence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">So when I had my first child, sheJanuary 23, 2015 agreed to put it all in order, with the help of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">And so we embarked on this project to get it in chronological order, and get the geography right, and the history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">And I started writing a book about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">And I did lot of research, and you know, interviewed my parents, mostly my father, and also other historians who were aware of — of this migration, this whole journey of these people that had been deported.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1087">QUESTION:  Okay, so I'd like to start from — from the beginning at least, but we’ll run through it, okay?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1089">QUESTION:  So, Mira was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> , and that was in what part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1090">ANSWER:  That at the time was <span class="REGION">eastern Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">Today it is <span class="COUNTRY">Belarus</span> , right on the <span class="DLF">border</span> really, with <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and — and not too far from where the current border of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1102">ANSWER:  But they were first there for maybe a few months, and this was in winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">And then they were taken back to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Perm</span> , which is of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Molotov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">And that was where they really were for the duration of the time in the — in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1105">QUESTION:  So <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Perm</span> was a pretty tough <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1106">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1107">QUESTION:  The — some of the stories that Mira shared with us today, are they ones that you are familiar with, that you had heard about before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1108">ANSWER:  Oh yes, I grew up with these stories, you know, but — you know, these were things that were discussed, especially at — during holiday times, or whenever our Polish friends would come over, because many of them had very similar stories, and they would start to talk about all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">Or just Sunday dinners, you know, this was something that was so large a part of their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Especially my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">You know, my father talked about it, but my mother was very — you know, she — she wo — she went through so much, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1112">QUESTION:  So, if I can repeat a little bit, just to make sure that I’m clear about, she had to work as a lumberjack?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1113">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">She was fairly tall for a Polish person, maybe not as tall as I am, but she was, you know, generally speaking, the — the Soviets took people who wereJanuary 23, 2015 working in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to do the harder jobs, because they were honed better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">And the people who were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> were doing lighter work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">And as Mira was saying, there was no one else f — to work for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">It was just my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">And so they came and assessed that she was strong enough, or whatever, to work in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , and she would have to go and chop off huge branches of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> that they felled, and — and yes, there was one occasion when she — I don’t know, you know, she was so tired by then, and — and malnourished, and just, you know, devastated by the whole experience, because for her it was a constant worry about saving Mira, that she didn’t end up in one of those <span class="BUILDING">Soviet orphanages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">And — and so this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> was falling on her, and she just kind of stood there, and you know, they — and watched this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> coming towards her, and at the last second she jumped into like a pile of rubble, and the — the branches from this rubble actually cut the —
QUESTION:  Broke the —
ANSWER:  — broke the fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">So she — she was in there, and they thought — the Soviets, the brigadier, the supervisor of the — of the work team thought she was trying to kill herself, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">And so they got mad at her for — for, you know, doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">And so eventually, actually turned out to be a good thing, because she ended up getting ga new job working — fixing — changing the oil on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tractors</span> , and also filling — there was one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steam tractor</span> that she had to fill water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">And she got paid more for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">But, you know, in the co — in the course of all of that, you know, she di — sheJanuary 23, 2015 almost did end up in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , because she was very patriotic and she would taunt the Soviets, especially the — the locals, which were typically Ukrainians, or Byelorussian’s that were the supervisors in these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">And she would sing Polish patriotic songs, and you know, just really — she kind of did things that didn’t help her, you know, and that’s another thing that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">So when she went to <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , you know, for this minor incident, they were — they were just — you know, it was kind of vengeance from that particular <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> supervisor that didn’t like her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1127">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">I wanted to get a sense of how this — how this developed, the context of such a bizarre thing, to be taken to <span class="BUILDING">court</span> for, you know, having hay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1129">ANSWER:  Actually, there were two court incidences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">One was the hay, and then there was another one where she was late for work, cause she had gotten — like gone back to get a jacket, or something, because it was starting to rain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">And that one was actually a much more serious one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">But the first time I think they docked her for, I think a third of her pay, which was just astronomical because she wasn’t getting paid very much anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">It was enough to maybe buy a loaf and a half of bread a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And so, you know, to lose that money, it was really, really difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1135">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And did you ever know, or did she ever — was she ever told why she was deported?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1137">ANSWER:  Because she was a landowner.</span><span class="sentence" id="1138">January 23, 2015
QUESTION:  That’s what I thought, that’s what I thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1139">ANSWER:  And — and also, I think they may have also known that her — they were still married, even though they were separated, her husband was a — a soldier, you know, he was sergeant in the army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1140">QUESTION:  Okay, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">All right, so when it comes to 1941, and there’s the agreement between the Polish government in exile, and the Soviet Union to release people who had been citizens of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> who had been deported, they learned about it from a former prisoner, rather than officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1142">ANSWER:  Right, they — the Soviets were not quick to let go of these free laborers, so it was somebody that had been let go earlier, and came back and told them about this, and so my mother had tried to get official permission to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but they weren’t — they really did not want to give it to her, so essentially, they escaped.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1143">QUESTION:  So tell me, this incident what — that Mira was talking about, where she would be a Red Cross nurse, and Mira would be left in an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , was this —
ANSWER:  Well, that’s much later, actually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1144">QUESTION:  Oh, I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1145">ANSWER:  That’s much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">Yeah, at — when — when my mother and sister were escaped from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , they made their way down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Volga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">And this is thatJanuary 23, 2015 incident with the little girl falling and being killed in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamboat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">And they made it to — oh, now I’m drawing a blank. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">I think <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kra-Krasnovodsk</span> , you think’? </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">A2: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kra-Krasnovodsk</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1151">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krasnovodsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And then they went from there, down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Caspian Sea</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pahlevi</span> , right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">Or no, actually, I’m skipping something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">There was a lo — there was — all these people were coming off of these <span class="DLF">collective farms</span> , or there — you know, some of them were sent to <span class="DLF">collective farms</span> , and more in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">And there was a huge mass of people, and they na — they didn’t know where to put them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">So in the <span class="REGION">southern Soviet Union</span> , they were traveling by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> back and forth, trying to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to — to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">Finally they ended up getting out after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And in that turmoil, that’s when they met my father again, okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1159">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1160">ANSWER:  So, because getting out of the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> already, things were much better by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">There was a official, the British were helping to establish these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">resettlement camps</span> , and one was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Teheran</span> , and that’s where my mother and Mira were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">I’m not sure it was for as long as she says it was, but it was many months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">And my mother studied nursing at that point, in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">And so, she did become a Red Cross nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And after that, they ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> , and there were there as — as Mira said, you know, for several years, with my mother January 23, 2015 being a nurse in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , and Mira went to a <span class="BUILDING">convent school</span> that was set up there, again, with British and Polish cooperation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1166">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">Now, let me go back to the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">I want to get a sense more of the geography. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">So from what I understand from you’re telling me, is that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they ended up staying in was bet — was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Perm</span> , the region of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Perm</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1170">ANSWER:  Oh, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1171">QUESTION:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">From there they escaped, and made their way to a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , where they were in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamboat</span> , and then went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krasnovodsk</span> , is that wh-where you were saying?</span></p>
