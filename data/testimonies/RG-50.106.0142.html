<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  My mother’s family lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , wa — 1-in the <span class="REGION">region</span> just near <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">We don’t know very much about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I know only that her grandparents were there, and her parents and of course she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">She didn’t know too much of the history beyond that, because her parents died when she was a young woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">March 10, 2001
QUESTION:  Who made up your family, do you — did you have any siblings?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Did you have a large extended family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> or in other parts of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  We had family, we had certainly, uncles and aunts. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">My grandparents lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> , in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Deutz was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> and they owned March 10, 2001 a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there and we were frequently over there, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I loved my grandparents, we were very close and —
QUESTION:  These are your paternal grandparents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Paternal grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My maternal grandparents had died long, long before I was born, and the only member of that family that I remember was my mother’s sister, who was about 10 years older than she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">She lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> at the time and we went to visit them, but only once and I remember that visit very well, I was quite young, must have been, oh perhaps four years old or five years old at the oldest and it was an interesting visit because as youngsters the two of us was very — were very excited to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">We went there and when we walked to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> they had a little dog, and it was a Spitz, I think, terrier. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And you opened the dog and the — <span class="DLF">door</span> and the dog jumped up on us and we were frightened to death, a fear that I had until I got my own dogs some many years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">But that’s the only recollection I have of my maternal relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  A-And their names were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Let me see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  It’s okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  I may not — I—I should know this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  Well, we’ll come back to it, that’s okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  Probably remember it later. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">March 10, 2001
QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Let’s talk a little bit about your family itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Was it a very — your immediate family, was it a very religious family, or a secular?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  That’s an interesting question. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">As far as I know, we were secular. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">My — my grandparents, my grandfather was not terribly religious, but my grandmother was, she was quite observant. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">My aunt, my father’s sister, her name was Selma, was also, I think, religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">She — she was a spinster and lived with my gran — my father’s parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">My — my mother kept a kosher home and as they have told me that during the Hitler years they became more involved with religion than they had been before because they were s — ostracized by the German community and therefore drew closer to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and there was sort of a — a renaissance of religion during that period of time amongst Jews and they were a part of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Were they — and my mother would not have kept a kosher home if it weren’t for my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">She did that for them and for — for my father and then of course, we were brought up in that fashion until we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> much later, which time all that was — well, I wouldn’t say all of that was dropped, I think for a few — a few years here I had religious education, and then we sort of drifted away from the formality of religion, and religion not a terribly important thing in our lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Do you remember any specific holidays as a — in your early childhood in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Any memories of those? </span><span class="sentence" id="55">March 10, 2001
ANSWER:  Oh yes, I remember very vividly going to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> on Simchas Torah, and the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> is Conservative Orthodox, you know, where of course, the women sat upstairs in the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> and the men were worshipping downstairs and as children we were with the men, as boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And I remember that holiday so well because during the service, the mothers would throw candy down from the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> , and my brother and I did everything we could to gather up as much of it as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">It was a delight, and I remember it very fondly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  What about <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ritual, did you observe the Shabbat or Passover?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  Yes, we observed Shabbat and it was a kosher f — <span class="BUILDING">kosher house</span> , and certainly observed the Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And for any child, of course, Hanukkah was the m — was a major holiday and that was always celebrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And one of the things that I do also remember, going to my grandparents’ <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they lived in a — what I could best describe as a — looked like a browns — what a brownstone would look like today. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">They lived on the <span class="INT_SPACE">lower floors</span> and there was a <span class="DLF">yard</span> in the back, rectangular <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">It was walled in on three sides, but at the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And in that little <span class="DLF">yard</span> , which was just delightful, there was a — always a sukkah. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So on the holiday of Sukkos we would go there and I would marvel at all the interesting things that were hung from the sukkah and the — and then we went to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> from there, and so those were my recollections really, of the holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">March 10, 2001
QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Did you live in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> or were there — was it mixed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  I would say 1-it -- where we lived it was mixed, very, very much so mixed. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">My grandparents — Deutz was the — where they lived was a — for I guess going back many hundreds of years must have been kind of a ghetto for Jews, a Jewish —a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I -- I don’t think it’s a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the common sense today, but 1t was an <span class="REGION">area</span> that was populated mostly by Jews, and the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> with — the <span class="BUILDING">Cologne synagogue</span> was there, the — one of the major ones was right in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , very near by. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So they were more — in a— in a more <span class="REGION">Jewish area</span> and my parents and we lived in — in a more modern area of — of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  What — what <span class="DLF">street</span> did you live on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  I remember it very well, 1t — the name of the <span class="DLF">street</span> was the univeri(ph) — <span class="DLF">Universitat strasse</span> , <span class="DLF">University street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And we had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on either the first or <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> , I don’t quite recall whether 1— whether it was right on — no, it was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> , I’m sure of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And across the <span class="DLF">street</span> was a very large <span class="DLF">park</span> , and — which was very interesting for my brother and I. We would look out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> on — particularly on weekends and all kinds of interesting things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Hot air balloons would be — would be launched from there, and of course there were a multitude of parades, with military music and the — and the Nazi youth and all of that, which was for a child at least, an eye opener, interesting to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We never really were March 10, 2001 a part of that, as you would understand, but we could see it all going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">It was quite colorful, and — and interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  You were obviously quite young then. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Did it mean anything to you to see these Nazi parades with these flags and uniforms? </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Or what did 1t mean to you as a young — very young child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  Well, we were pretty well indoctrinated as to what the Nazis were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Our parents did not keep any secrets from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And we were — it was there, we felt totally apart from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">We felt as though we were not welcome to join it. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">This was for Germans and that Jews were not welcome in these — in these circles, or at least in this crowd. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And although we looked on it with interest, and possibly as a child with longing to be a part of something, we knew that it was beyond us to be able to be a part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Just wasn’t possible, and did we feel ostracized by it? </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I don’t think so, not in that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I think my feelings were that it would be nice if we could be a part of all of this, but no, it was — it was not — it was not to be and there was too much fear attendant to trying to be a part of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">We knew we wouldn’t —
QUESTION:  Because”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  We knew we wouldn’t be welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  How did you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Well, we had any number of personalized experiences in that — this was a time when we started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and we were — we went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , which I think March 10, 2001 wa-was already at that time forbidden for Jews to go to the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> or to the — to other <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , we had to be in separate <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And in those <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , walking <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we were often chased by Nazi youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">We made it our business to stay out of their way as much as we could because we knew that they would taunt us as we went from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> back to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">But it didn’t happen all that frequently, just, you know, once — oh, it’s so difficult for me to remember how often, but it did — 1t — all that has to do is happen once and you remember it, as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And we did, we just —my brother and I learned how to run very fast and we ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">We went — ran <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and that was that, when they bother us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  You — you used the expression Germans and Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Did you not feel German in any way”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  I didn’t have a sense of nationality, not at that age. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I kn-knew we lived in — in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that we lived in, which was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Deutschland</span> , that was our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , but my association was that we were really not a part of 1t because of our Jewishness. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">My parents I don’t think had that feeling so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">They felt themselves as being German. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And — but they made it clear to us how unwelcome the Jews were and I — there were other incidents that I can relate to you where I was — where I recall how they tried to d—to keep Jews out. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So, did I feel German? </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I knew I was there, I had no sense of nationality, I was perhaps too young to have that sense of nationality. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I do know that I was very much interested in geography. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">My parents spoke often of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and March 10, 2001 that was very interesting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">You know, where is <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and what is happening there, and why is it so great, and — because they made it sound very, very interesting, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And then we learned ab — all about — my father was — tr-traveled a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So when he was abroad and he — all those years, even during the Nazi period, he was traveling in <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and he told us about his trips. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And this was all very fascinating for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So, we were in — I never really had a — you — to get back to your original question, I never had a sense of nationality at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Fascinating interest with the world and different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , but no sense of nationalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  What language did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  We spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">That was the only language that we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Just to step back, which gives you an idea of the — the way I became aware of being a Jew, and how unwelcome we really were, not just from what my parents said, but you would go to <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> or look, and you would see signs in the <span class="DLF">store windows</span> , Jews ungerwurnscht(ph), not wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And you felt strange going into those <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> , although shopkeepers often didn’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">They — they welcomed you because they — you were after all, a client, you were going to spend some money and they would happily sell you things. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">But the signs, nevertheless were in the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and in the <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">One in particular I think goes back. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We used to go to a <span class="DLF">beach</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> and my mother took the two of us, Norbert and myself there quite frequently during the summers and we would enjoy bathing in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I wanted to learn how to swim. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">March 10, 2001 The interesting thing is how they taught swimming in those days, they put the student on a long string attached to its waist and on a pole and just held them there in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> so that they’d learn how to swim. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We were too young for that, but we had the wish to learn how and be a part of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Anyway, we’d go to the — to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> quite frequently, and it was a lot of fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Kids love that, and we loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Then one day we went and there was a sign, Juden ungerwurnscht(ph) and my mother -- and I s-saw the sign and my mother pointed it out to us and she went to the proprietor of that <span class="DLF">beach</span> and se — and said, what does this mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I mean, we’ve been coming here for years. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Oh, oh, no, it — she said, this doesn’t apply to you, you can — you can come, but you know, we have to have these signs. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So although we — we went, the comfort level of going there suddenly went down several s — degrees — more than several degrees, quite a lot and we learned at a young age that we were somehow different, that because we were Jews, we were not part of the general public in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">We learned it also when we took trips with my parents on weekends to go to — th-the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhineland</span> has got many, many interesting historical sites and <span class="BUILDING">castles</span> etcetera, which children love to see, and we would go there and often there would be the sign, no Jews allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We sometimes ignored those signs and sometimes it was a little too uncomfortable and we just went — did not go there, or my parents chose not to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Perhaps they knew where they were serious about not having Jews and where they weren’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">The Rhineland overall was not — I don’t think the people in the March 10, 2001 Rhineland were all that much in love with the Hitler era, that administration, and many of them did not agree with what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">But nevertheless, they had to live their lives and they did what they were told, as all good Germans did in those days, but still found ways to tolerate the Jews who lived amongst them. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Except for a few. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Obviously there were always those who were rabid Nazis and who you had to stay out of their way of and — and for me as a child, particularly the — the youngsters who were part of the Hitler youth, who m-made it their business if they did s-see Jews to at least taunt them, if not physically assault them. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I don’t remember ever being physically assaulted, but we did lead fairly normal lives as children, aside from this discrimination. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">My brother and I used to — we found our way to the <span class="BUILDING">circus</span> once. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">When we were supposed to be coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we wanted the circus so badly we hopped aboard a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> and went out to the <span class="BUILDING">circus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And of course my mother was beside herself, why didn't the boys come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">But those are the kinds of events I think that most children do. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">You could do this and there was no fear that somebody would harm you and take you away or steal you, or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">You could — we — we felt no danger in doing those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Perhaps my parents were concerned, but my brother and I were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Then of course, things got a little bit more dicey and —
QUESTION:  Okay, we — we’ll get to that in a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Talking about you and your brother, how would you describe yourself? </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Were you a — it sounds like you were a little March 10, 2001 independent child there. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">W-Were you, or were you different from your brother, or how would you characterize each of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  Well we were — we were close as youngsters, so we did everything together and when we had a desire to do something, at least we had somebody to do it with. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So, we were adventuresome. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I don’t think that we were abnormally risqué. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We did the things we wanted to, but we also hewed to being <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and — and doing our studies and listening to the things that we needed to, listen to our parents, and when they said ja— do your homework, we did our homework and all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So we were not wild, as such, but we had our moments when we wanted to go out and have some fun, and we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Were you an athletic child? </span><span class="sentence" id="160">A physically strong child?</span></p>

QUESTION:  I meant you weren't — you weren’t frail.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  No, no, no, by no means. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I think we were rather normal in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">One of the things that I remember those — those years, was that it was always difficult for my parents to get all the things they needed in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Things were in short supply, particularly things like milk, eggs, all kinds of foodstuffs. </span><span class="sentence" id="169"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was not well supplied in those things and there were always shortages and of course we depended on the goodwill of the Christian shopkeepers, or the German shopkeepers and they — March 10, 2001 as I said before, there were always those who made it their business to help out and we found that — my mother always found means to bring in what we needed to subsist on and all — often — I-I don’t remember us starving, I don’t remember us having any difficulty in — in getting the things, the substance that we need — the subsistence things that we needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I do know, I remember my mother talking about how har -- difficult it was to get these things, and there was one event that I guess epitomizes, that we went — we were going to go to my grandparents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deutz</span> and we —my father loaded us in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and he had gotten — apparently in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deutz</span> my grandparents couldn’t get all the food that they wanted and he had gotten some fresh eggs, which were also in very short supply, he got them in our <span class="REGION">area</span> , or through his friends there. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And we had set off and shortly, I think, before or after we got to the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> that goes across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deutz</span> , a — another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> sides — hit us from the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">It was a major blow and I wound up with a cut on my leg and wound up in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , my mother wound up in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with a cut on her scalp. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And the only ones who really got free from it — Norbert also wound up with something, but not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">My father was not injured. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">But during the time, he was so concerned — you know how nervous one gets when something like that happens, his first thought was oh my gosh, the eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And he picked them up and he put them in his pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And of course they were all smashed in his pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">But that gives you the idea of how scarce these foodstuffs were, that he would think of that in a m — in a moment of March 10, 2001 panic or trauma, to save those eggs to get them to the grandparents, which was the important thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And we wound up in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> at that time, 1n a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic hospital</span> , and it was Passover, and I remember the — the nuns in white habit and also in black habit coming, taking care of us and they were very, very nice, we had a doctor, an- and I needed some stitches in my leg and it was all done. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">When they brought up the food, of course, it — I didn’t want to eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">It was Passover, we were taught that Passover has to be kosher and it has to be matzoh etcetera, so I s — spoke up and I said that to the nuns, and they understood it completely and took care of us and brought us what we — what we would need for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I do think that the <span class="BUILDING">religious institutions</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> recognized, at least from that experience, recognized more that there were customs that other — others hewed to, and they respected that. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I think they respected any type of religion, as long as it was religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And so I’ve — I did not feel that we were badly cared for because we were Jews, it was — certainly didn -- didn’t have that feeling at that time.</span></p>

QUESTION:  How did you know, as a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  My parents told us. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">They were very open. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">We had a <span class="BUILDING">household</span> that was — they kept nothing from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">They assured us of our security and we relied on them for that, and believed that, but they also told us what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">They told us of many of the people who had been persecuted who were Jews, who — and there was a lot of persecution, there were people who lost their jobs because they couldn’t — couldn’t work any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Jews were not allowed to have Gentile maids in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">All these things happened and we were — we either saw it and we were — or they were — we were told about those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And I remember as a youngster my father kept a revolver. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And of course this was very exciting for two young boys, we always wanted to see the revolver, and my father showed it to us but he never let us touch it, which was terrible, we wanted to get our hands on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">But one day we took our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and we were visiting our grandparents across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> and my father took that revolver with him and he stopped in the middle of the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And he took it apart and he started throwing pieces of the gun into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> , one after another. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And of course we were curious, why? </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And we learned that we were — Jews were not allowed to have weapons and if we did have weapons there would be dire consequences and he was getting rid of it, and that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">He was just — he was not going to let the Germans have it, for sure, so into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine river</span> 1t went. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And maybe that was one less gun that was used 1n the war, who knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">So we — we knew, and March 10, 2001 we grew up with that, and we went — and when we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we — we knew we were in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , we knew we had friends, obviously, in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">In 1937 - 1938, things got really — they escalated, they — the Germans — the — the rules and the many laws they put forth against the Jews affected us more and more. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">My father’s company was taken over. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">It was a Jewish company to begin with, Lisauer’s(ph), and they — the Germans appointed a — a Aryan company to take it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And the Jews could continue to work there to show them how to operate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And my father, that’s where my father’s employment was, so he continued to work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">But obviously all opportunity for advancement etcetera was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And we knew that too. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Then — it was at that — during that period of time that my parents said, you know, we can’t continue to live here. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Perhaps even earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And they started to inquire about how they could get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">It was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">The quota for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was completely full, it was years to wait to get — to get to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , but fortunately my father had connections through his business, in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Particularly in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> he had good friends, we did a lot of business. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And so he started making arrangements to get permission to work and live in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , while he was still employed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">We started hearing about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> about that time and we knew people who were either living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , or — or who had come recently from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where they had sought refuge in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , that the Gestapo came and picked them up and sent them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And where were they going? </span><span class="sentence" id="235">March 10, 2001 They were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Everybody knew there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Certainly all the Jews knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">What happened there that time, we didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">They were just taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And this was kind of a frightening scenario. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">My parents, who — I —I—I guess most German Jews who had lived there fo-for many, many years did not fear that they would be taken away one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">It was mostly — at that time, mostly the immigrants that came into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from the east, from — principally from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> who were the subject of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They didn’t — the Germans just picked them up, put them on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , sent them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And one day I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and it really brought it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">We were in the middle of a class, and suddenly some men walked into the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> , and they started calling out names of our fellow students, and they said come with us, and took them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And my brother and I, when we got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that day, we asked our parents, this and this 1s what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And they explained it to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">These were the sons of Polish parents who had settled there and sent their kids to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> where we were and they had been called by the Gestapo and they had a few hours to get their things and their children together because they were being transported out. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">This was frightening for a child, you know, to know that you could be in a <span class="BUILDING">class</span> , that somebody could come in and order you out, and with your parents you’re going somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">You’re going out to some — someplace, and of course we knew then that they were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , or — March 10, 2001

<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  My — my parents knew, I knew it from my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And they — they had heard of, or known, I think, friends and acquaintances who had gone, some of them had been released and — at one period or another and they told of the ones that had not been released that had been sent to various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">So we knew there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">How? </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I only knew it from my parents.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="262">QUESTION:  What about neighborhood children? </span><span class="sentence" id="263">You said you lived in a mixed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , did you play with non-Jewish children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  No, I don’t recall — I don’t recall that. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I — our time was taken up in going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , coming back, being with our parents, going with our parents to see our grandparents, going on excursions during weekends, that kind of thing, and I don’t March 10, 2001 recall having any other friends in — neighborhood friends that we played with or that we saw.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  As a six or seven year old, were you afraid of your non-Jewish neighbors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  No, we were not afraid of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">We were not afraid of our neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">We had some very nice neighbors, I know my parents spoke to the people who lived across the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> and as a matter of fact — I know for a fact that one of the — that family lived across the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> , the man was a member of the SA, but he was quite nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">He always made it his business to — he — he ran a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> , I’m not sure which, and when he had something that he could bring, he brought it, gave it to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">So they lived — these Germans lived two lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">They lived one life in which they paid homage to the Nazi party and everything and the trappings that went with that and they heard the stories about how evil Jews were, and yet they could live across the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> from a family of Jews and still find them as decent and honest individuals and work with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">That’s the strange part. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And — that these people could have promulgated what they did to the Jews and be a part of that is a — something that will always be a mystery. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Oh, I have lots of theories on that.

QUESTION:  What did Hitler mean to you as a six or a seven year old? </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Did you hear his — see his pictures, hear his speeches, what — what impressions does that make then on a very young child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">ANSWER:  Well, we saw Hitler in the way that our parents saw him and our grandparents saw him and their friends, and he was the object of ridicule in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">As this — so we — we had zero respect for Adolf Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">He was a menace, I think, for all of us in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and our parents and our friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And I had no other thoughts, but you know, Adolf Hitler was not the — we — we knew that was somebody we should not like, and as a six or seven year old, that was about tt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  Did you have any nightmares, things like that about him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  No, none. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">None whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">What scared us perhaps was the — th-the police, cause they were so unmoving and so — they had their — now, how can I describe them best? </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Autocratic. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">There was no appealing to them, you know, you — you — and in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , if some -- if a police officer or — or a [indecipherable] told you something, you did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">There was no appeal from it, it was a person to be feared. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And Hitler was just the head of this whole establishment, created these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Now, police were never the kind of people that I could warm up to, and perhaps it comes from those days in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">The authority figure — you know, if you feel that you’re doing everything right and you’re suddenly faced with a -- a policeman who’s telling you, or giving you authority, you — th — there’s always that apprehension, what 1s it that I March 10, 2001 did wrong? </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And if I didn’t do anything wrong, why 1s he standing here, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Why is he poking his nose into my business? </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And that was pretty much it, we stayed away from the police.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">QUESTION:  Did you see any examples of degradation on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and when you were outside of — degradation of Jews on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , you personally see anything?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="323">ANSWER:  Well, it was a sign of the authority, the German authority, and did it evoke any feelings at that time? </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I don’t think so, not at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">That came a little later, when people started wearing the armband. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Then you would sense that they were part of the crowd that really hated Jews and made you feel uncomfortable, didn’t — they didn’t want anything to do with you, they didn't want you to be part of their lives and so it was a sign that these were — these were anti-Semites. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I guess in our own way we March 10, 2001 knew that the minute we saw that armband it was — they were part of that authority in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that we feared. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Some time in 1937 — 1938 it became absolutely clear to my father that they had to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And my parents, because of his contacts in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , made arrangements to seek permission to work in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And since his company had an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and he had friends, his business acquaintances were very close friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , that was a logical <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">So they — my father had a —a-—he’s told me these stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">His company was involved in international trading, and as such, they had special permission from the Reichsbank to travel and to make deals in — abroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And my father, being a young man at the — at that time was the one who was assigned that task, to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And he used this permission, which was in letter form, to travel rather freely. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And he would use that for — to gain permission to enter the -- <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">So while he was over there working, he made arrangements to obtain the permission to work in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , which he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And when he came back they — and made the final decision that their — they were leaving, they said well, we have to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">We have to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">We have to see what’s going on, let’s take a month or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">We’re going to go and we’re going to make these arrangements, then we’ll come back and wrap up everything we have and bring it to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So in the summer of ni — of 1938, we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and my father had his papers with him, so we got — arrived at the <span class="DLF">Dutch border</span> and we were stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Now, do you have anything to declare, this ca March 10, 2001 — you know, at the <span class="REGION">German side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And the <span class="REGION">Dutch side</span> was — they were standing, they were wide open, no problem over there, but — and my father said no, we don’t have anything to declare and they said, how about the boys? </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Why are you leaving? </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And my father said to them, well, you know, they -- we have polio in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And it’s the summer, we want our children to be safe from that, we — oh, so you have polio in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Well, that means your children were going to have to get a health certificate, because we can’t let you go across the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Obviously we can’t allow polio to spread. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Course they knew we were Jewish — Jews, the passports had all been stamped with a J, so they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And my father said well, how do I get these permissions to get across to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , th-the health certificate? </span><span class="sentence" id="351">They said oh, you can’t get them, you might just as well go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And he said no, how can we — then he insisted. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">He said, well you have to see the [indecipherable] I guess, the county executive or whatever in that <span class="REGION">area</span> and he can do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Well, where can I find him? </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And he said well, he’s in such and such a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And my father took off to get that. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">In the meantime we stayed there at the <span class="DLF">border</span> with my mother and they tore our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Literally went through everything to see whether we had anything at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And as my mother tells 1t, we had — we had gotten some gifts from some friends or relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , the coats and hats and my Aunt Selma had put some perfume in the hatband, and they found that, of course, and confiscated it, which made Norbert and I very upset that they would take that away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And my March 10, 2001 mother said, don’t you worry about it, whatever it is, we can replace it. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Let them have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And we waited for my father to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Well, as the story goes, my father told me, he said he went to see him and he was occupied somewhere and insisted he go in and see this county executive, and he walked into his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and he gave him a quick heil Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And he said, why can’t I go across the <span class="DLF">border</span> , I have my children, they have — we have polio in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and they insist on having the certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And so the fellow said well, you know, if you don’t mind, you know, they — they have polio here in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">If you don’t object to your children being exposed to that, then why should we, and he signed it, gave it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So he came back to the <span class="DLF">border</span> and there we were, everything had been stripped and taken and it was quite late by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And the — the Germans were furious, of course, that he had come up with the certificate, they didn’t want him to — didn’t want to give him that opportunity that — to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And even though it was very late, the — and the <span class="DLF">Dutch border</span> supposedly had closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">So they thought that maybe this was all over, we couldn’t get in any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And the German said, okay, you can go, with a smirk on their faces, I guess, knowing that the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Well, lo and behold, they started drive across and the Dutch opened the <span class="DLF">border</span> and they said, what was going on there? </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And they said, you know, we seen a lot of this with Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">We kept the <span class="DLF">border</span> open for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">So the Dutch were extremely decent and wonderful people and we went over and for the next month or March 10, 2001 six weeks we stayed in a — kind of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">resort town</span> on the <span class="DLF">beach</span> , and — in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sunfort</span> was the name of the reso — the — the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">beach town</span> .</span></p>

QUESTION:  — and your brother do? </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Was it a fearful time? </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Did you think your father was maybe not going to come back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">ANSWER:  I don’t remember my feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">I think we trusted our parents explicit — implicitly and had no concern that he wouldn’t come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">We just waited. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I had — honestly I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">You know, those are things that they leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I remember — I remember the — the searching and I remember the fact that they took these silly little bottles of perfume, and just waited, and then off we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And we — when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , my pa — we were at this <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> and my parents put Norbert and I into a — I guess best described as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> , my — which we enjoyed because it was <span class="ENV_FEATURES">beach</span> , it was the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> right there and —
QUESTION:  Did you know Dutch?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">ANSWER:  No, I didn’t speak any Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And my parents said — made certain arrangements, they got whatever necessary arrangements they needed to make in order to — to make their final move, and asked our friends to find an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And they were going to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and pick up their things and head off. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And they said, March 10, 2001 you know boys, I think you should stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Because at that time things were really getting bad, it was difficult to get money out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , couldn’t be done any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And they didn’t want to put us in harm’s way. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">But my brother and I became absolutely hysterical. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">We didn’t want to be separated from our parents, and we raised quite a ruckus. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So much so that our parents said well, we’ll take you back, we will somehow manage. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Something happens to us we’ll all go through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And we actually went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">QUESTION:  You boys were seven and a half at the poin — at this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">ANSWER:  That was, that time seven and a half years old, exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">So back we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and my parents at that time wrapped up what they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">They sent their bookcases and some f-furniture, books mostly because they loved books, they loved reading, so this was very important for them that they bring their bookcases with them, and sent them off with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">moving van</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And my father got tickets for — no, he didn’t get tickets there, they ... he made whatever final arrangements had to be made t-to — to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> was moved, happened to be on November eighth, and out we went, the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">So we went over to see — to — to live in <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> for one — for one night because the next day we were taking the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and we were [indecipherable] we were going to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">So we went over to the <span class="BUILDING">Dome Hotel</span> , which was right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">cathedral</span> in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And the <span class="BUILDING">Dome Hotel</span> is situated on one of the main <span class="DLF">shopping streets</span> in the city of 29March 10, 2001 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> , narrow <span class="DLF">shopping street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And we went to sleep that night, my brother and I.

QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Alfred Schnog. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">This is tape number two, side A, and you were talking about how you were in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Well, we were in the <span class="BUILDING">Dome Hotel</span> , my brother and I went to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And sometime in the middle of the night we were awakened by my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And she said boys, come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And we got up and she took us to the <span class="DLF">window</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and stood us between the drapes so that we could look out on the s — onto the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And down below was this noise of shattering glass and — and we looked down and we saw these uniformed individuals, the brown shirts, throwing rocks into the <span class="DLF">window</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> that was just across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And there were others inside the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> throwing porcelain and glass out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , just piling it up, just heaving it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And I remember the — 1n the glow of the streetlights, in the yellowish glow of the <span class="DLF">streetlights</span> and the cobblestone <span class="DLF">streets</span> and all this stuff just shattering as it hit the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And my mother said to me — sa-said to us, boys, she said, take a look. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Never forget what you see here. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And of course we wanted to know what was happening and we asked what’s happening, and she said, that’s a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">One of the finest <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> in crystal and everything and they’re just destroying it. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Well, we didn’t know — what we didn’t know was that not just there, but everywhere, this was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and this was the night that the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were all burned and the — what March 10, 2001 we didn’t see, the — the Jews being rounded up and being ostracized and as they were dragged down the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">These were things that we learned only afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">But we did see the carnage that was taking place across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and down this — this whole <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And in — it’s something that I don’t think I can ever forget, the image of it is so vivid in my mind, the whole thing, it’s — 1t was the first time in all those years that we actually saw violence. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">We had seen and we had feared all the other things, but this was true violence. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And it — and you know, I’ve read a lot about these things since then. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">The Germans claimed afterwards that it was an uprising on the part of the German people against the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Just remembering all those people in uniform, it was no uprising of the people in, I mean it was the — it was the — the Hitler youth, the — the SA, the brown shirts and whoever else wanted to participate in this, did this. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Anyway, in the morning my parents took us to vi — say goodbye to our grandparents, who were just across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And the grandparents said, my God are you still here? </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Get out, get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And then we learned of the carnage that had been happening the rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and obviously what was happening all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">The <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> had been burned, the people had been dragged out of their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and they made fun of them as they — down the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Elderly people, and — and they sent us off. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">They shooed us out, but quickly, and said get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And so my parents went directly to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> from there and we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">There were a lot of other Jews on March 10, 2001 the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Many of them had come from the east, finding their way through. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And some of them had, as we found out a few days later, some of them who were actually on their way to emigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> were also on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">What we didn’t know, which we learned shortly thereafter is that the Germans has sealed the <span class="DLF">borders</span> everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And we arrived at the <span class="DLF">Dutch border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Police boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">All Jews, out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And we were all taken out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , all our baggage off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> , a horse drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> without a horse, and we were marched to a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Best thing I could describe it as, and locked up in a — in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I remember the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> vividly, there we-were quite a number of people in that <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And I remember the green <span class="DLF">door</span> and the bars on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and the <span class="DLF">window</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> in the open, which was to be used by everybody there and of course as children having to use the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> in front of all these people was something we didn’t like, and I remember the-they shielded us when we had to do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And we were there for a period of time, I’m not sure how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">My father had some papers with him and in — it— and he was concerned that the Germans might see those papers and misinterpret them or find them, and he ate them. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And for my brother and I, this was a marvel to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I think maybe made a big impression on us more-so than even going to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> 1s that my father would eat paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And these are — it’s funny, the things that you rec-recollect. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And sometime within that day or the next day — it seemed to me it was March 10, 2001 just one night that we spent there, but my parents have often said it was almost a week, and I don’t recall that. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I think it was just — I think it was just that — that night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">QUESTION:  Were — were there other children, or were you boys the only ones?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">ANSWER:  I believe we were the only boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">There were a lot — there were other people in that <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Some of them were single men and single women, you know, these were groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Husband and wife maybe, perhaps families as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And at one point I guess we ha — my father had an opportunity to speak to the commandant there of — whoever he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And he explained to him that he was traveling here on business. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">He had this document from — still — the Reichsbank, and that he had — was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to bid on some very important materials which were needed for the — the war effort in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or for the military, and they couldn’t keep us incarcerated because he had to get on with this business. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And the man apparently told them well, you know, I have to see — I — first thing I have to do 1s feed 3,000 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">He said, we'll take care of you after that’s done. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">But apparently, coincidentally, the — there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> sailing from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> which had booked passage for about a thousand Jews who had permission to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">The Aidam(ph) was the name of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And apparently this was made known to the German authorities there and they didn’t want to create a situation — at least we think they didn't want to create a situation where there would become known that they prevented Jews from leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">It would have been politically unwise, maybe created March 10, 2001 too much of a public relations problem for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">So they decided to let those Jews who had that passage booked, and pay for us to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to catch that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , it was sailing from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And my father said, well look, I have my papers for <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Didn’t have any passage on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And somehow he managed to get us in with this group to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And it was just, I think, good fortune. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">There was a point just before we went into this <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> where we — where my mother and father were told by the — whoever was leading us to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ersatz concentration camp</span> that they had put up, or that — this <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> where they were going, where they were apparently separating or segregating people, where they were going to put them and what have you, assign them to some <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And they said to my parents, they said look, you will go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> where you will be safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Your children will go to an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And of course the minute Norbert and I heard this — and I recall that too — we started to raise the <span class="DLF">roof</span> because we were not going to be separated from our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">This was — we were just, I guess frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And I mean, really scared that we might be separated from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And my mother said, children calm down. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Nobody is going to separate us from anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Before that happens, I will take your lives and mine right here. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And she made it known, she was very distinct about it, and she always carried a — through her lifetime she always carried a paring knife, which she used to peel apples, cause she loved apples. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And she was fully prepared to take that knife and cut our throats and her own throat so that March 10, 2001 that wouldn't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And it wasn't so strange, because there were people who attempted suicide in that <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> because they had lost everything, they knew they were going to be sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , back where they came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And there were any

<p><span class="sentence" id="548">ANSWER:  Well, it was just — I don’t know whether I was — that I even thought about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I think it was I just took it for granted, that this was <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , that it was — we were — it was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">There were — there were no military marches, no — no police that — or Hitler youth that would march around and wave their flags. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">It was just — didn’t exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">QUESTION:  Did the Dutch Jewish children accept you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">ANSWER:  Yes, they certainly did. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">We had no trouble getting along with the Dutch Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">My parents were able still, in 1938 - 1939, shortly after they arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , to get my parents — my grandparents out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Now, we know that they must have left without anything, because — at least my grandparents must have March 10, 2001 left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with nothing in their pockets, to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">We know that — well, the Germans made the Jews pay for all the damage they — they caused on Kristallnacht, that’s history. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And they weren’t allowed to own property, they weren’t — things became so oppressive for Jews that my grandfather, I’m sure, sold his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for a pittance at that time because there was nothing else he could do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Whether he could every take the money with him to get it out, I don’t know, I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">But they managed to get them to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and they had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , not too far from where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">My brother and I used to bicycle down to their <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="562">As a matter of fact, a-about 10 years ago it 1s now that I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , I went to see where we lived, which I r-re-remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I’ve been there recently too, and I actually took some pictures of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And I could find my way still, to my <span class="BUILDING">grandparents home</span> , it’s so well ingrained in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">My parents, the moment they arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> said well, we’ve got to start thinking about a little — getting even further away from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and finding a — another <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go because if it can happen there, it can — might happen here. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">We just don’t feel secure. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">It was not just that, it was also, I think for economic reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">You can imagine all the Jews that wound up in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , all seeking employment. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And the competition for my father must have been extremely severe. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">He was the young man who arrived, he got the dirty jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">He had to do all the traveling, which in many ways was f — was good, it helped, because he could — he went to — to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> quite a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Matter of fact, he even — he even walked into March 10, 2001 the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , offered his services because he was so much aware of where German industry was and what they needed and what they had to buy, because that was his business, this is what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And he ma — was able later to make use of those connections, when we finally left <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , he was — that — that helped him a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">But they had — my parents, during the time that they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had applied for visas to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> as did practically every Jew in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And the likelihood of that happening was extremely, extremely slim. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">It was a lottery system and — and when he — and when they wound up in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , my father said you know, I’m going to contact the <span class="BUILDING">American embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> and we will have our files transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">After all, we’re now in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , doesn’t do us any good to have that file in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> , why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="578">So he wrote them a letter and he got the file transferred over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And I suppose that lot of things came that worked together at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">There were a lot of people who just couldn’t, even when their number came up for a visa, couldn’t accept it any more cause they’d already been transported somewhere else, to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And the quota suddenly opened up enough so that one day — we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> I think for almost a year and a half, two years, close to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Suddenly he got a call from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> , Mr. Schnog, bring your family here for a medical exam. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">If you pass the medical exam you will be able to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you’ll get your visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">So they had to make a decision as to whether to stay — of course they had March 10, 2001 jobs and they were well settled in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , or whether to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And after everything that happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and I think also because of the severe competition for jobs in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> at the time, they decided th-there’s no question about this, let’s — let’s get out, let’s get as far away from this menace in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as we possibly can. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And they went to the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> , we had our physicals, and in two weeks they had a visa to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">All that excitement, you can well imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">They started packing up their things and making plans. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And because they couldn’t — I don’t know whether they could bring their money out of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> or whether they had a problem with that, but they decided to book passage first class because they couldn’t do anything else with the money, on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cunard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Cunard White Star line from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> they sail — sail from, to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And packed up our things, sent them ahead and suddenly we were leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Left f — said goodbye to my grandparents and we went to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schiphol</span> , I think it was, pretty sure, and we boarded — and this was during the — this was already during the war, during the Phoney War between <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because in 1940 <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was drawn into the war because the Germans had invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">There was a — an agreement that they would — that <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> would declare war, and they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">QUESTION:  I-I was going to ask you about that, in September 1‘, 1939, did your parents talk that over, were you aware of that? </span><span class="sentence" id="595">March 10, 2001
ANSWER:  Oh, we — we were fully aware of world events and what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">My parents were interested in it, I was interested in it and — and this was, for us, listening to current events was what it was like for American kids our age following the baseball season. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">It was important in our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Obviously it had enormous amount of — of importance in our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">So we — w-we wanted to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">We wa — and war, 1t — you know, it was war and we a — we had gone through the — the Russians, I think, invading <span class="COUNTRY">Finland</span> , and this was in the news everywhere and as children you — you followed this. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">In fact, we weren’t the only ones, I think all the kids in those days, followed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B

<p><span class="sentence" id="607">ANSWER:  No, it did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">We felt very secure, very safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">We had no concerns. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Indeed, my parents had no concerns being in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was a neutral and nobody expected that they would be involved or become involved in a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">They hadn’t been March 10, 2001 in the first World War and they were — certainly weren’t going to get involved in this one. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">It was a very liberal country and we felt very, very safe there. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">But I do think that the economic opportunity wasn’t there and this 1s what really proved to be the most important reason why my parents decided that they should leave and — and come somewhere else, or go somewhere else.</span></p>

ANSWER:  We had seen pictures in magazines. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">This was mostly what my parents had explained and told us about. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">It was our imagination working, perhaps overtime. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I really don’t think so, I think our imagination had it right. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">One of the things that was so interesting in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , so many things happened, as a child this would be interesting, apparently we had a friend, I don’t know whether he was an immigrant from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or what, and we were very much into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , my brother and I. My father at one time in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had owned a — a lot, a <span class="DLF">car lot</span> where people would bring their old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and he would disassemble them for the metals, the copper and the —all the precious metals that were <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and sell the rest of it off as scrap. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And my brother and I often went there and played in the old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">We’d climb into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabs</span> and turn the wheels. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">It was a lot of fun, very enjoyable. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">So <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> were a passion for us, we could recognize every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobile</span> on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , what it looked like, whether it was an Opal or whether it was a — a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Ford</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Volkswagen</span> or whatever, we knew it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> this man came over and he — was a brand new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , I think it must have been a Nash or something like that, as I recall and it was a very modern styling for that time and my brother and I were so impressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Well it turned out this fellow had stolen the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and it wasn’t long before they caught him and I guess put him in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , I hope in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , not in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but they — they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">So there were all these adventures. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I remember my mother taking us to the <span class="DLF">tulip fields</span> , and seeing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">We — we spent a week or two weeks of vacation sailing in the March 10, 2001 Zuiderzee, which at that time was open to the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> , which has since been dammed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And we were there with some of my parents’ friends and colleagues, acquaintances and we sailed from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to the — all around this — this huge <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And it was just marvelous and — you know, and then one of these old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dutch ships</span> with the — what do you call them, the sideboards that would go down. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">They didn’t have a keel, so they had sideboards and we would sail all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">My father was a wonderful photographer and he took some beautiful, beautiful pictures of that, some of which I may still have, I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">They’re very wonderful.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="664">ANSWER:  Not a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Not a word of English. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">I was fluent in Dutch, I could speak German, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And what impressed me about <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> were the barrage balloons. </span><span class="sentence" id="668"><span class="COUNTRY">England</span> being at war, although the air raids had not started, they were flying these barrage balloons over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="669">They were not more than, I would say 200 yards off the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , up in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">So they — they looked like small blimps floating everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And all the — at every <span class="DLF">intersection</span> where the police had a traffic cop or something, their — their <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> were all sandbagged in. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And they were on a war footing. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And this impressed us, my brother and I. The blackout during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="674"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Cars</span> driving around without — with shielded headlights. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And — so I remember that — that wartime London. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And I —I remember my brother getting sick 1n the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , he had caught some — some something. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">What it was I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">But he was there, maybe it was influenza or March 10, 2001 something like that, and we were stuck in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And my parents had to stay with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">My father was out — would go to the — to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , he had friends and etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And they sent me out to purchase a bulb for a flashlight, because he needed it at night, everything was blacked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And they said okay, now you go down <span class="DLF">Regent Street</span> right here and down a few blocks and you walk into a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , it’s about a block down and you go ask for a light bulb. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Of course, they told me this in Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And I said, well what’s that in English? </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And they said, well we’ll look it up for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And they looked it up and they said, well you ask for a bulb. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I said bulb? </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And she — yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And off I went, I couldn’t speak a word of English. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And marched down <span class="DLF">Regent Street</span> , into the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and I asked for a bulb and managed to get it without any difficulty. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I think it — that was a interesting and very formative experience for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">It taught me a little bit of independence, that you could go anywhere, and you didn’t have to be afraid, that you could make yourself understood, no matter what. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And — and for a young — for a young man that was, I thought, kind of maturing and I came back and we had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Now, we had to stay, we had to get permission in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to stay a little longer because my brother was ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And they had booked the passage with <span class="DLF">Cunard line</span> but they hadn’t — the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> hadn’t been designated at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">So my father had to go to the police there to get an extension. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And he called his friends at the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> at the time and said here, you know, I need to get an extension, can you help me out? </span><span class="sentence" id="698">He was afraid that they wouldn’t March 10, 2001 permit it. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And they said well, just go to the police, don’t worry about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Just go in there and ask them. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And he went there and they said of course, you know, you don’t have any problems here, you can stay as long as you like. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">This they didn't understand, or didn’t — you know, they didn’t expect it. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I can’t say they didn’t understand it, they didn’t expect it. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">They didn’t expect that you could have so much freedom in — in any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and there wouldn’t be somebody who would say no, you can’t do this or you can’t — you — you must have these papers, or you must go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I’m sorry, you can’t stay, you have to go back to where you came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And these were very comforting for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">My brother and I didn’t — really weren’t concerned, cause we weren’t aware that these — that this might be a problem or that they were — tha-that my parents were concerned about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">But eventually — of course my brother got better in about three or four weeks and in March, I guess it was, must have been March, we finally told that the — we would have the passage on the Cunard White Star liner, the Britannic, and to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> on such and such a day and we board — they didn’t tell us what the name of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was because they were afraid that there would be too many — too much information around and it would get back to the Germans and there was this submarine warfare going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">They didn't want anybody to know what <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> were in <span class="DLF">port</span> and when they would be sailing. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">So they just said, come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> and you’ll be on one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessels</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="806">ANSWER:  Yes, it was in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cold Springs</span> , is it? </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And they left us there in — where the — for — for I guess six weeks, for the summertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And we were old enough at that time not to object to being without our parents, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And we — and I guess two or three weeks after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> started, they came up to visit us. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And they came and they went to our counselor and they said, how are the boys doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And the counselor said well, what do you mean how are they doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="813">They’re fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">No, that’s not what we mean, I mean how are they getting March 10, 2001 along with the other children? </span><span class="sentence" id="815">He said they get along okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Well but, my parents said, they don’t speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And the counselor said, of course they speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">He never knew that we couldn’t speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And within a matter of literally weeks, we learned enough, learned English sufficiently so that no — nobody ever knew that we didn’t sp — that we weren’t English speaking to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And I always feel that such submersion for young people is probably the best way to learn a language. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">It really 1s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="822">QUESTION:  So you didn’t have a German accent or anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="823">ANSWER:  No, no, no accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">Well, I — certainly not a German accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">Well, I think one of the reasons that we picked up the language was — so quickly was because we moved from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , we learned Dutch in a relatively short period of time because Dutch is also very similar to German. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">But Dutch also has a huge number of English words in its language. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">So the transition was an easy one. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Go from German to Dutch to English. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">It was quite easy, at least for me and I think it helped enormously to — to have that progression. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">So here we were in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and we could speak English and shortly after that summer my parents —
QUESTION:  Were there other immigrant children in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="831">ANSWER:  No, not that I know of. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Oh, there may have been, but I didn’t know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I had no — no knowledge of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">March 10, 2001
QUESTION:  Di-Did you tell the other children where you were born and some of the things you had lived through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">ANSWER:  Don’t remember recalling or saying anything to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">My brother and I were in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="837">We spoke to each other, obviously and we just kept our ears open to what was going on and what was being said.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="838">QUESTION:  In German you spoke to each other?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="839">ANSWER:  No, no, in — 1n the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , in here. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">Th — in German, I — no, we spoke Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">If we did speak, we spoke Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">We didn’t want to speak German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="843">QUESTION:  Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="844">ANSWER:  Ger — Germans were anathema in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> at that time and we didn’t want to have the kind of discrimination experienced against us because we were German and German speaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">We wanted — we didn’t want anything to do with Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">Germans were a pariah and we didn’t want to be part of the pariah. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">If people noticed that we spoke German, they might take offense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="848">QUESTION:  That’s quite sophisticated for a nine year old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="849">ANSWER:  Not if you’re accustomed to — not if you’ve been accustomed to having that sort of thing done to you as a Jew in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="850">You were accustomed to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">You would know that if you were just different than anybody else, if you wa — if you were different, you better be somebody different who everybody liked, not somebody different whom — whom everybody despised. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">So being Germans was not on the top of our list, March 10, 2001 but we spoke Dutch, and that was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">See, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was still very friendly, they weren't tainted with Nazi persona, so we said okay, we — we were speaking Dutch, and that was at that time our major language. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">We came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> — because my parents didn’t speak Dutch at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we no longer spoke Dutch, we spoke English at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">We promptly dropped Dutch and now I recall very, very little of Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">Very little. ’'</span><span class="sentence" id="857">ve been back several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">I can probably read some of it and understand a little, but I don’t speak it at all the way I did as a child when I was very, very fluent in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">But German, strangely enough, being the mother tongue, I remember and I can understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">So that was that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="861">QUESTION:  So they you came back after the summer and you started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="862">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">By that time my parents had moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forest Hills</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="864">QUESTION:  Queens?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="865">ANSWER:  Queens. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And — an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> there and we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">I guess it was there, for the first time in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> that I experienced that anti-Semitism was not a phenomenon that afflicted Europe alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Because we were in the — I guess the third grade in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forest Hills</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Very lovely <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , P.S. three. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And I remember that it must have been one of the national holidays and my parents had pinned an American flag to my lapel and my brother’s lapel and we went off to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And I'll never forget it, but the teacher, knowing that we were immigrants, had made a remark that you shouldn’t be wearing that flag, you are not really March 10, 2001 Americans, or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">Something along those lines. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">And my mother took tremendous offense, she went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and really — she was a very outspoken woman, and she was quite outspoken about that sort of thing and said so. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">But more than that, during our growing up years here, we had occasion to go with our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">When we were a little bit older we went on holiday with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">And one of the trips that we took was up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Adirondacks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="877">End of Tape Two, Side B March 10, 2001 Beginning Tape Three, Side A
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Alfred Schnog. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">This is tape number three, side A, and you were going up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Adirondacks</span> with your family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="879">ANSWER:  My parents had arranged to rent a cabin on <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Trout Lake</span> , near <span class="DLF">Bolton Landing</span> 1n — in the Lake George region of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Adirondacks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And they had packed provisions to take up with them, put them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and we headed up north. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And when we arrived at the <span class="BUILDING">cabin</span> it was truly a horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="882">The <span class="NPIP">place</span> was overrun with bugs. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> were rotten and it was the kind of <span class="NPIP">place</span> that 1t would have been difficult to stay at in any circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">So my mother said, I don’t care what we have with us — and in those days we didn’t have such great refrigeration, so we said we — we’ ll just have to go find someplace else to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">They didn’t realize is that every <span class="NPIP">place</span> there was jam packed and during the summer you couldn’t find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="886">What we didn’t realize til we saw it were the restricted signs. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And there were — came in any number of forms. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">There were either just plain restricted, a sign that said restricted, which everybody knew meant no Jews, or <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> nearby which meant essentially the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And it came as a — a Surprise to me, or perhaps not as a surprise because of what we’d been through. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">But my parents managed to ignore those things and live with it and possibly they could ignore it because they had so much experience in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ignoring it. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">But it left its mark. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">Certainly left 1ts mark on me, that anti- March 10, 2001 Semitism in whatever form, perhaps not as virulent as 1t was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> could exist anywhere, and indeed, it does exist almost everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">So —
QUESTION:  When did you take this trip the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Adirondacks</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="894">ANSWER:  When? </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Do to the — I — this must have been in — I must have — I was — I was older.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="896">QUESTION:  Was it still during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="897">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">It was still during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">We had saved gasoline coupons and whatever to — to make it, because gasoline was severely rationed during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">I think I must have been about 14 years old at the time, which would have been in 1900 and — well, maybe 13 or four — 1945 — ’44 - ’45, in that — in that period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">I think maybe in —I must have been 13 at the time, I’m pretty sure it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And we — we traveled around trying to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay, and not because of the restricted signs we couldn’t stay, it was just simply they were full, couldn’t take anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And we wound up at a — right opposite where we had rented this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabin</span> at a — at a — turned out to be a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And we walked in, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> hadn’t started yet, but the owners were there and my parents asked whether they could stay there over the ni — overnight and they said oh, stay as long as you like. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">They saw two boys and obviously it was — they could sign up two campers, which indeed they did, so we wound up spending our summers there for the next four or five years and 1t was wonderful experience for us, and a nice part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and we got to know a lot March 10, 2001 of interesting people and made a lot of friends, some of whom I still see today, and — went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="906">QUESTION:  What was the name of your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="907">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp —</span> name was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Waldman</span> and I don’t think it exists today. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">I think it’s been sold, I don’t know who owns it or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">But the owner was a fellow named Charlie Garland who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Glens Falls</span> , he was a baker. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And they were wonderful people, very friendly and so here was this really strange combination of anti-Semitic signs on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> going up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake George</span> , and here this tremendous welcoming o- of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that it was run by Jews and obviously these people were extremely well accepted in their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community,</span> because we got to know them quite well, they were known all over the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="911">So all these things happened together and 1-1-it was a strange mixture, really, and it — it -- it puzzled me at the time and it still puzzles me today, how these two things can coexist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="912">QUESTION:  Speaking about being 13 or 14, did you and your brother have a Bar-Mitzvah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">ANSWER:  Yes, we were —
QUESTION:  Could you tell a li — a little bit about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">When my — when we moved in here and we became — we were 11 or 12 years old, my parents said, well boys, you — you know, you have to think about your Bar-Mitzvah, and we went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rego Park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Today it’s a very large <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , at that time it was a small <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> , very Orthodox and we went to March 10, 2001 <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> , and we — and <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> and like every good American boy we hated it. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">Despised it. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">In fact we — we spent our time doing mischief rather than paying attention to the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">I remember sticking a girl’s bobby pin in the light socket and blowing out the lights in the whole <span class="NPIP">place</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="920">But it was — and no — and what amazed me most was the teacher came over to me, are you okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="921">She was more concerned about me than I wa — she thought something had blown out of the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Aft — and I was totally responsible for the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">But, it was about that time that my father learned about the death of our — of my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And he, having been brought up very religiously, he went every morning and every night to — to the minyan to — to the <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> , and Norbert and I accompanied him. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">We went every single day with him for that — for that year of morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And we learned our Bar- Mitzvah lessons and had a — went through a regular Bar-Mitzvah at that <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="927">It was a very nice time, we an — we loved the day, we loved being there, we loved — you know, when you’re — when you go through a Bar-Mitzvah, it’s a wonderful thing for a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">It’s a — it’s n— the learning and the stepping up to it is horrible, you hate it, every minute of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">But when the day arrives and you manage your way through it, the pride that you feel, and the — is exhilarating. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And we — we really did enjoy that immensely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="931">QUESTION:  Was it hard for you to go through it without your grandparents and knowing what happened to your grandparents? </span><span class="sentence" id="932">March 10, 2001
ANSWER:  I don’t think I gave it very much thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">It may have been very hard for my parents to realize that this was happening without their parents being there, but we had accepted the death of the grandparents and didn’t even think about the fact that they weren’t there, or — we didn't look back. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">I think that’s more of an adult thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">You — you do that when you have more [indecipherable] we were more concerned about how well we would do in reciting the Haftorah and the Torah portions and how — and what might happen afterwards because we had — all my parents friends would come over to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> afterwards and we would be on display, obviously for them and — and we’d have to recite the blessings before the meals and the — and after the meal and all of this, which was important to our parents that we know those things, and — you know, and we did know them and have long since forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="936">QUESTION:  Were you very devastated when you found out about your grandparents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="937">ANSWER:  Well, we — I had very fond memories of my grandparents and yes, I was — I can’t say that it was devastating, it was a loss. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And I’ve thought about it many times, you miss them. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">But it was probably the f — the first time that — you know, there was so much death that you heard about in those days, so many stories of how people died. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And by that time we were old enough to understand, and to know that this was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And so it wasn’t a — a total surprise and it wasn’t totally devastating. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">You sort of knew that they were going to be caught up in it and that was that. [—</span><span class="sentence" id="943">-I-I remember that we — none of us held out hope that they would ever get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Perhaps March 10, 2001 we hoped because they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> that they somehow might be safe from the — from what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="945">But it was just a hope, and didn’t turn out to be the case, and that wasn’t all too surprising, because we had — we had heard of other case, of other people in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> who had lost their lives, who’d been sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and were no — no longer alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">Not just that, but people had committed suicide because of the struggles they were going through and they just couldn’t live with it any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">There were many who did that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="948">QUESTION:  Did your parents keep in touch with other relatives?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="949">ANSWER:  Yes, they did, they kept in touch with those relatives they had, we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">There were — we had — my father had some relatives who had moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> as well, who had managed to escape because they were — had become Dutch citizens, they escaped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aruba</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Curacao</span> and still live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">And it’s quite a large family that’s down there and they’ve done very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">They — I think they own the agency to distribute <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Toyota cars</span> on those <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="953">Nice people, I’ve met some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">We haven’t been down there but we’ve — they’ve been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and when I — certainly if I go down there, the name Schnog will be all over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> , as it is, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">So yes, we’ve managed to keep in — somewhat in touch with those relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="956">QUESTION:  So now you’re a teenager, did you have many American friends, were you totally accepted, except for that teacher who commented about the flag? </span><span class="sentence" id="957">March 10, 2001
ANSWER:  Oh, no, we never had any trouble with that, our — our — many of our teachers were Jewish themselves and at that stage nobody knew any longer that we were immigrants. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">We spoke English without too much of a trace of an accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And we were good students, we had a lot of friends, very close friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And wa — I guess we were almost normal teenagers that time, we — I don’t remember — I remember that I did very well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I loved my teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">I think the next most troubling thing in my life was the fact that some of my teachers were involved in the McCarthy si — era situation, that thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">You know, when we grew up in those days, we were very liberal, almost Socialistic — I would say Socialistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And we — a-and our teachers were very liberal, very bright. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Well, we admired them and they were — enormously. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">My math teachers, my science teachers, there was — th-those were the classes I really adored, I loved them, and the — and they taught us so much and taught us a love for learning. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">I had a Latin teacher who I was very fond of, who was very fond of me because she passed me despite the fact that my brother was the one who did all the work and I did all the copying. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And —
QUESTION:  Did you stay in <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="968">ANSWER:  Yes, we stayed in <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , went to Forest Hills High School and graduated in Forest Hills High School. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And then went to — we were — went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , went to <span class="BUILDING">Cornell University</span> , where we both took an engineering course. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">Which was probably the first big mistake I made in my life, but nevertheless, you know, in those days you March 10, 2001 stuck with what you started and you finished it. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">And if you changed, somehow it was an admission of failure in one direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">At least I perceived it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">I was maybe too immature to realize otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">So I stuck with engineering and got my degree, but might have been much, much happier in a liberal arts environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="975">QUESTION:  Le-Let’s go back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">What was it like when you were 14 and a half and the war was over?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="977">ANSWER:  Well, there was tremendous joy when the war was over, and — you know, we joined in every celebration that — that had anything to do with destr — destroying Nazism and Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">In every way, we just — all of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> did and we were in the forefront of it, we did it just the same way, we hated this dictator. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And we laughed at all the comical songs that were written at the time about Hitler, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And when the war was over — you know, we’d — we’d — as children at that age, we dreamt about going into the army and fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">We wanted — that was — that was very important to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">We were too young and our parents probably would have been horrified at the thought of it, but we’d have dreams about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">We wanted to be in the army, to be a part of this, to fight as a soldier in — 1n <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="984">Not — not that we had any feeling because we immigrated and we came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> we had to do this, but simply because we were patriotic Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Extremely patriotic, as was everybody in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">I mean, there were kids in our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in our <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> who lied about their age to get — to go — to get into the Marines, or to get into the army, or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">March 10, 2001 My brother and I were very young, we looked young. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">We could never have passed 17 or 18 to be able to get into the army, so we — it never dawned on us even to try. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">But if the war had gone on, we would have au — we — I’m sure we would have been in the forefront of volunteering to — to go into it, and we felt it was an obligation that we had, to serve in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="990">So when the war was over, it was quite great. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">We wanted to know all about what was — what had happened, where — what was left in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="992">My parents actually went over and they saw what was left. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">This was [indecipherable |
QUESTION:  When — when did — when did they go back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="994">ANSWER:  They — shortly after the war, it was either in 1940 — it probably was — I would guess it was in 1946, I would guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Might have been 1945, but I think that might have been too early. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">It must have been early in 1946, and Europe was devastated. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">And they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and saw all the devastation that had been wrecked on the German cities by the continuous bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">And they saw — they saw some of the people who lived there, or recognized them when they came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">A story that my mother and father tell — told, they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and they looked up a couple who was — they had run the <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> , I guess, there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">And they went and asked about them, and they still were running a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">And they went over there to — and they looked in the <span class="DLF">window</span> there, I guess they were running a <span class="BUILDING">pastry shop</span> or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">And the woman who ran the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> , and my parents knew, looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and saw my mother and she turned pale. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">She said, Mrs. Schnog, Frau March 10, 2001 Schnog, is that you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">And my mother came in and said yes, it’s me, we’re back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">How are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">Tell me, how did you survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And they were, as my mother said, very decent people caught up in this horror story with the Germans, they — many of them couldn’t do anything out of fear that something would happen to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">Indeed, my father tells the story about a man who couldn’t keep his mouth shut, he says, and he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deutz</span> near my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">He was Christian, he hated the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">He let everybody know that these — Hitler and these Nazis would ruin <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And what’d they do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">They caught him, they cut his head off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">So that kind of terror visited on a population brings about so much fear, that people shrink away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">No wonder they put signs in their <span class="DLF">windows</span> , no Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">If they didn’t, God knows what would have happened to them, in their own minds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">So there were a lot of — a lot of Germans who didn’t willingly participate in this, who did so I think out of fear, and what reprisals might be visited on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">There were some of course, who went right along with it, who — who thought Hitler was the last word and you know, this is — this 1s the new Siegfried, the — the hero of German mythology is going to — th-the vag — the Wagner people, all this romanticism that really isn’t romanticism, it’s just pure Germanic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">And those are the ones who Hitler really appealed to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1019">QUESTION:  How — when did you become a citizen and what was it like for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1020">ANSWER:  Oh, interesting, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">When my parents arrived here they immediately applied for citizenship and it was a five year waiting period. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">Five years passed and they were March 10, 2001 called before a judge and I re-remember going with them before the judge and the swearing in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">And they were just thrilled, as I was, and — to become an American citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">This was a dream that had come true for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And shortly thereafter, we — my brother and I became citizens by derivation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">So we also were called and we were sworn in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">And I, of course, have that certificate and it’s something we’re all very proud of, and we — listen, this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> saved our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">The fact that we got over here may have been pure luck, or it may have been God’s doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">I don’t think it was that, I think it was just plain luck and a little bit of fortitude and a little bit of courage on the part of my father, and seeing what was happening and — well, but to escape so many times from — slip though at the last moment, always the last to arrive before the <span class="DLF">doors</span> shut, 1s something that amazes me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">I am now probably the only survivor of my immediate family because my brother passed away at 54, he had pancreatic cancer and died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">My mother died in — when she was 90 — 91 — 90 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">My father died of the Alzheimer’s disease in — when he was 84. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">But I often ask myself, you know, why am I here longer than the other? </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">Why ar — why aren’t there more of us who managed it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">But you -- when I think about some of the stories that you read about people who don’t believe or who refuse to accept the fact that there was a Holocaust at all, it’s something that I don’t — I— number one, I don’t understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">Number two, I ga — these are the kinds of people — the kinds of people who — who — whose thought process 1s so shallow, the same one who Hitler was able to — to inveigle to March 10, 2001 bring into his party. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">That’s — that’s a horror and so anything that — you know, history is something that lives only with people who have lived it themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">Those that haven’t, except for the few who educate themselves, who will read history and will be able to understand it, for — except for those, people not only forget, but it has no meaning for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">They read a history book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">There was World War II, it lasted from this date to that date. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">This 1s what s — took place, but 1t means nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">It means absolutely nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">When I was a child I talked to my grandfather and I asked him about World War I. My grandfather served in the German army in World War I, and he told me stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">He told me the story one day of an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> that came and dropped two bombs in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> , and I was impressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">But World War I had no meaning to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">Not from what was relayed to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">It meant nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">World War II, yes, had every meaning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">I was too closely involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">You know, look at our children today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">They look back and they come to me and they want to know a little bit about World War II, I can tell them certain things about World War II, but it won’t have any meaning for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">They are much closer to the last war we fought in, the <span class="DLF">desert</span> or in perhaps <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> if they’re a little older and went through that era. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">But even that passes, and if they don’t inform themselves and don’t reach back and read the history and in — get involved a little bit more closely into what — perhaps into people’s lives, or into — there have been some wonderful books written about World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">If they don’t read that, or if they — if you haven’t read “AII Quiet on the <span class="REGION">Western Front</span> ,” you March 10, 2001 would not really understand the abhorrence of war that came out of World War I. And I think that’s missing today and much of that is missing and it’s too bad, it really is and I think this is the kind of thing that fosters the thoughts that the Holocaust never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">And it sure did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">There was one other vignette that’s rather interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">A few years ago, here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , my parents were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> and my mother — I came down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> to go to attend an affair of some sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">I’ve forgotten whether it was a formal affair or whether we were just going out for — for dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">And I was over at her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , we were chatting and I was getting dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">I was staying with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">And I had forgotten to bring my cufflinks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">And I said, Mom, you know, I don’t have any cufflinks, did Dad have any? </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">And she said yeah, yeah, wait a minute, I have something for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And she brought out a pair of silver cufflinks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">She said these — these will do fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">And I looked at them and I said, yes they will, where’d Dad get these? </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">She said, well, it’s an interesting story, I have to tell you about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And she said, when your father was young, about to be Bar- Mitzvahed, 13 years old, there was a — your grandfather, Arnold, rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to a German soldier, an officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">And he used that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to entertain his girlfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">And he was a very nice gentleman and he knew your father was being Bar- Mitzvahed, so he purchased those cufflinks for your father as a Bar-Mitzvah gift. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">And, she said to me, you’d be interested in knowing the name of that German officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">And I said, yeah, well who was he? </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">She said, his name was von Stauffenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">And I March 10, 2001 star — I was startled; von Stauffenberg was the general who took part in the assassination attempt against Hitler in the latter stages of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">So history touches you, no matter where you are, at one point or another, and here in a pair of cufflinks, it reaches back and it touches you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">And it’s these kinds of stories that make history alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">I hope I can pass all these things on to my children that they’Il remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">I don’t know whether I — I have myself been back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> on several occasions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">I’ve been there on business and I’ve met people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">And you can’t help, when you meet one of the older generation, my generation, you can’t help but wonder where they were in those years between ’38 and °44, what they were doing, whether they took part in any of the atrocities that were visited on the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">But you hesitate to ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">Maybe my parents weren’t so afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">Maybe they did ask, a few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">But I’ve never asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">I’ve met some of the younger people and they don’t really have a recollection of it, and in that case perhaps it’s good for them, for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">One of the interesting trips that we recently took, we went a cruise and wound up — up in the — in the Baltic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">And we would up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rostock</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">And there they had a bus trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">Well, for the people who were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cruise</span> , and there were a group of Jewish people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cruise</span> who wanted to s — particularly see the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">My wife and I didn’t have an overriding interest to do that, but they needed to gather enough people together to — to put a busload together and we volunteered to join them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">And so we went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">March 10, 2001 End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B

<p><span class="sentence" id="1094">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">So, as I say, we volunteered to go along with them, and we went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and we had a German guide, a young woman, very knowledgeable, who took us around and showed us the highlights in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and the tour. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">And the tour a — the centerpiece of the tour was going to see Checkpoint Charlie, and what used to be <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> and the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , this small section that they preserved for histo — for history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And very little was remembered by the guide of — or was told to any of us about World War II and what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> during that period of time, period of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">It was interesting observation for me, because the young Germans were more — much more affected, and understandably so, by the separ — the — the separation of east and the — <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> and the hardships that the <span class="REGION">eastern Germany</span> — Germans experienced, and the fact that they were separated from their families and couldn’t see each other, and the — the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and the suicides that resulted from that, or people who were killed trying to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">And this was foremost in their minds, this was how horrible things were during those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">They didn’t look back to World War II and what happened then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">That was not part of their being, their March 10, 2001 substance, their — their memory, and — except for one instance, which I found highly interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">She told us, the guide, that she was taking us to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">And we got out and there was this very large square, quadrangle in the center of the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">And we marched out to the middle of this square and mostly cobblestones and in the middle was a square. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">I don’t know, I would say it was the size of, oh, maybe three meters by three meters, so about — roughly about thr — a little more than three yards by three yards square, and glass, right in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">You kn — you know, it was part of the — the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , it wa — it wasn’t raised in any fashion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">And she gathered everybody around this glass square that was cut into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and she said, would you please look down and tell me what you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">And we looked down and what we could see under the glass were empty bookcases around the square and she asked whether we knew what that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">And of course being all Jews, many of us did know exactly what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">It’s a representation and a memorial of the book burning, where the Nazis had burned all the books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">An — and that that would be there in — at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Berlin</span> , well I thought was extremely interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">The fact that she knew about it and that she was willing to tell us about it, even though it was not on her tour and that she wasn’t expected to show us this, was very interesting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">Then we wound up — which they clearly avoided because they saved it for the last part of the day, we wound up at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish synagogue</span> there, which was burned by the Germans, probably on Kristallnacht, and — and restored. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">Now it’s no longer being March 10, 2001 used as a <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> cause it was violated as religious ground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">But we stood <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">There’s a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> right next door to it where we could go in for a few minutes and see what there was, we really didn’t have much time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">But there were two plaques on the outside of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> explaining what had happened and how it was restored, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">And most of my fellow cruise members couldn’t read German etcetera, so I wound up being the one who read the plaques for them and translated it for them, and they were quite moved by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">And I was pleased to be able to open their eyes to this and to be able to read them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">Now I think they were, strangely enough, more affected by it than I was, because I had been through it, I had seen it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">I think it was more of a shock to most of these people this actually happened and that this is where it took place and these are the — the memorials to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">So I—I found that trip very enlightening and I guess more so from the point of youth that the Germans today are, just like everybody else in the world, they are obsessed with the history of today and not with the history of yesterday.</span></p>

QUESTION:  This is 1953?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1132">ANSWER:  This was 1953. ’</span><span class="sentence" id="1133">54, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And we — we thought we might be able to get a nice plush assignment, maybe go to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , which was very interesting, or I thought, my goodness, you know, I’m fluent in German, maybe they could send me to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you know, I could — would be a wonderful opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">Well, of course the United States Army doesn’t think in those terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">Nor did they know or did they think in the terms that I was an engineer, a graduate, they could have put me into any number of positions where that would have been useful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">No, I was in the ordinance corps and I was going to be — and I had that — you know, they had all these electronic things, they could have easily put me into that and helped, but no, no, I’m going to <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> and that’s that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">So off we went, my brother and I both went to <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">Fortunately we went shortly after Eisenhower had made his historic visit to <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> and the war was — the fighting had stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And we were there just shortly afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">So the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was extremely poor, <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> , and it wa — had been destroyed and we wound up at the — March 10, 2001 at an <span class="BUILDING">army depot</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Incheon</span> , [indecipherable] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">ve since been back and you can’t recognize it any more, the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> has boomed economically and — of course not in <span class="COUNTRY">North Korea</span> , but at least in <span class="COUNTRY">South Korea</span> it has. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">And we spent — I spent two years there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">My brother was stationed up on the DMZ, the demilitarized zone at the time, and we’d see each other occasionally, I would fly up with friends of <span class="DLF">mines</span> who were pilots and — and in — in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">They would fly me up in these sal — small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> and I’d visit him or -- and he would return the visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">Sometimes we’d — got our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeeps</span> and drove up through these rutted <span class="DLF">roads</span> and dust and — and it was a— it was a boring existence cause there was nothing to do, and <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> was cold and miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">The rats were the size of — well, pigs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">They were huge, and you’d live with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">There were a lot of — there were a lot of people who had been displaced by the war, a lot of orphans in <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> , which you know, just tore your heart out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">And as soldiers and as officers, we did what we could to help out these <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">We collected from our troops and from the re — other officers to help these people, and they were very grateful, they were — for everything that we could do there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">They’re a tough people, the Koreans, they really are and they manage to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">But it — you really — it was not the kind of service that I expected in the United States Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">I expected, you know, World War II, you’re going to go out, fight, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">But no, no, no, nothing like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">Met a lot of people and learned a little bit about the average American, and how much — how important the average American is to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ’s March 10, 2001 life, and how basically good they are, despite — da — it doesn’t matter what their level of education is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">It really didn’t matter and there were people — I was — one of the jobs that was assigned to me, I was a commander of a <span class="BUILDING">depot supply company</span> there and one of the other jobs I had was to — was for the education, I was the education officer for the battalion and we had many, many sergeants, people who had worked their way up through the ranks, who barely had an education above a <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> level. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And we furnished them with additional — with — with <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and tried to bring them and as well as many of the — the enlisted men up to at least a grade level or a high school level education. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">But it didn’t matter how educated they were, they were basically very, very good people, very honest people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">I had a group of sergeants who I got along with extremely, extremely well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">They did things for me — at that time there was absolutely no accountability for supplies in the United States Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">And when I was — when I signed — when I took over the command of my company, I signed off on things I didn’t know I had, or didn’t know existed and — and when it finally came time for me to turn the company over to the next officer that would take over, I had to do a — an inventory really, what th — what the heck did we have and what did I sign for, and you know, I’m responsible for this, have to sign it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">And there were — there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> in there that I remember that I never even knew existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">And — and we had — and we had some things that we had so much in excess of that it shouldn’t have been there, but I se — I said to one of my sergeants, I — what — what March 10, 2001 are we going to do about this, or where’s this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">He said oh please lieutenant, he said, don’t worry about it, just bring the guy over tomorrow morning, we’ll take care of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">So in the morning I came over with a new officer and I introduced him to my staff and I said okay, would you — h-here is our inventory, would you sign off on it please? </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">And we start looking around and when he checked it off and we went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and there is this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> sitting there and I look at the inventory list and the serial number, everything 1s just exactly the way it should be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">And I said hm, I guess it must have been somewhere, but — and the fellow signed off and everything was just perfect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">And when he left I pulled out a bottle that I had there and I said, look gentlemen, the s — the sergeants — well, you know, I guess this is goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">I want you to have a drink and — and we exchanged pleasantries, had a drink and I said, now wait a minute sergeant, I said, where the hell’d that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> come from? </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">And he said sir, he said, in about five minutes we have to return it to battalion A, and we’ve got to repaint the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">So it’s that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">Everybody would help everybody out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1174">QUESTION:  Di-Did putting on an American army uniform bring back any memories of German uniforms?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1175">ANSWER:  No, not at all, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">The way I saw and perceived the Germans were almost like the — theatrical costumes, theatrical people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">They were so outlandish in their style of dress with their epaulets and their — and their polished boots and their — you know, you don’t get this in the United States Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">I hope not, I hope we never will. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">March 10, 2001 And it did not, it did n — I — I—I never even thought of it in that fashion, never equated my service in the army with what — what I saw in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , never. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">So then we were finished with our service in the army after 14 months, came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and I at that stage had a choice to make in my career as to whether I wanted to be an engineer for the rest of my life, or whether I wanted to try something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">And I knew — had known really all along that engineering was not my calling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">And Is —I said, well you know, it’s something I can always go back to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">But I went to see my father and I said dad, you know, can you get me a job with your company? </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">I want to get into sales or something where I deal with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">And just to see whether I like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">I can always go back to engineering. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">And he said sure, and he got me a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">I essentially went to work for my father’s company. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">My brother, who graduated Cornell as an electrical engineer as I did, was pretty close to being top in his class. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">I — I was, I guess, the goof off and he was the one who a-applied himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">Not only did he apply himself, he had a calling for engineering. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">He was a lot like my father, my father always wanted to be an engineer and never had the opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">My brother had the opportunity and made the most of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">He immediately went to work as an engineer when he got out of the army and wound up in the — in the optics field in engineering. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">Interestingly enough, one of the highlights of his career was that he testified before Congress. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">Malcolm Wallop’s committee, which at the time was looking into the feasibility of <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> and using <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> for military purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">And my March 10, 2001 brother, along with four other engineers, or three other engineers, I guess, were called before the committee to testify. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">They were known as the Gang of Four.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1199">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1200">ANSWER:  And I have a book that actually states that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">And I think he had a lot to do at that time in persuading Ronald Reagan to go ahead with his space missile programs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">So here you have a young man who was brought up in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , who escaped with his life testifying before Congress, I think it’s amazing, and — that he accomplished all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">He was instrumental in designing the mirrors and the optics for the first <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> — astronomical space obs — <span class="BUILDING">observatory</span> , which they shot up into <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , it worked very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">He was working on the Hubble when he died and my nephews and nieces say, you know, if Norbert had been around to finish that job with everybody, they wouldn’t have had the trouble they did with the Hubble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">Well, you know, that may be, it may not be, who knows, but he — he spent his career doing that and was quite, quite proud of it, and he should have been.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1206">QUESTION:  Did you keep up a close relationship as you all became adults?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1207">ANSWER:  We kept up a relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">Was it close? </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">My brother and I are totally different personalities — we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">And it was difficult for him to express his inner thoughts and to open up to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">And I think also difficult for him to open up his feelings toward me, or with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">We certainly kept up contacts through all those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">His children March 10, 2001 are now as close to me as my own children are, particularly his son, who I think has more in common with me than my own son. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Their —

ANSWER:  [indecipherable |
QUESTION:  — did you used to talk about your early childhood when you were adults, about what you boys went through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1215">ANSWER:  Not terribly much, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">I think he had his recollections and I had mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">No, I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">We — more — we kept up more with the kinds of things that happened later in our lives when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">Our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> experiences and the time there, let’s say, perhaps the — some of the years that we spent in the army together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">Not so much as to what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and — and in — 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> prior years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1221">QUESTION:  So you went to work for your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1222">ANSWER:  Went to work, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1223">QUESTION:  And did you stay in the long — a long time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1224">ANSWER:  I worked for my father and we — I was stationed up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> for awhile learning how to become a steel scrap trader. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">And it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">I had problems dealing with New Englanders because they were so difficult to talk with, you know, they didn't open up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">I — I think one of the things I learned there was that sometimes it’s good to keep your mouth shut. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">I never forget the time I had to persuade a New England scrap dealer to sell me a carload of scrap, because we were going to ship it March 10, 2001 off to — on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> com — sailing out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">And he was selling all his scrap to a competitor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">And so I went in to see him — Leroy was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">And I said — I introduced myself and I told him who I worked for and I said, I’d like to buy your scrap and I gave him my sales pitch, this is what I want, this 1s what I’m ready to pay for it and I really would like to start and I hope you can give us a chance, and what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And then I had made my pitch, I said, what do you think? </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">And he didn’t answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">He just sat there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">And for awhile I said to myself, well, should I say something, or shouldn’t I? </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">And I said, you know, I’ve just said everything that I need to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">If he’s not going to reply to me, just keep your mouth shut, sit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">For once in your lifetime, don’t say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">So I sat there what was an interminable amount of time and I don’t know how long it was, maybe four or five minutes or so, which 1s ridiculous, you know, you’re sitting there and you’re wondering what you’re going to do, and beginning to sweat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">Should I get up and leave, what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">And he suddenly said, yup, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">Now, I don’t know what he was thinking about, I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">And I won’t ever question it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">But that was that, I said thank you and I left and I sent him the order and that was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">So I learned a lot from that experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">I stayed with that company, I wasn’t happy there in <span class="REGION">New England</span> , and moved back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and met Ben Livingston, who was an elderly man, was my father’s partner for some years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">And we — and I got into the import and export business in — in — in steel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">It was in the new <span class="BUILDING">steel business</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">And in 1962 he retired from the company. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">And I know he March 10, 2001 was — he was not happy retiring, he was an active man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">He was in his 70’s, but wanted to continue to work, which is very interesting because I feel exactly the same way today and I’m probably about the same age he was when he retired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">And so, with my father’s help, I spoke with Ben Livingston and we put together three people and we Said, let’s go out in business and start the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">And I figured that Ben Livingston had a good reputation in the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">If he stayed active in the business for just three years, we’d have enough grounding in order to be able to — to run the business without him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">Well, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">We went out, found a small <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Lincoln building</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and went to work with three of us, myself, an associate of mine and Ben Livingston, the younger associate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">And we started to build the company. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">And in three years Ben Livingston showed no signs of retiring and he was as — he’s — he was — h-he lived until he was 89 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">He came into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> every single day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">He was no longer active in the daily trading, but he became a very close friend of mine and we were able to talk to each other and pass information back and forth f-for — for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">We — I finally took over as the president of the company and it was extremely successful, 1t worked out quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">Into — one of the interesting incidents I’Il never forget with Ben Livingston, he was in his 80’s already and found it difficult to get around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">He was using a cane. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">He was a big man, heavy, and he would start losing some of his agility. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">And I was in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> talking to him, I was going to take a trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> , a business trip and I sat down and I told him March 10, 2001 what I was going to do, and how we were going to get around, we had a problem there, and discussed the problem with him and how best to solve it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">Suddenly the lights went out in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and we were on the — that time on the <span class="INT_SPACE">21 floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Lincoln building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">And I said okay, let’s sit around, let’s see what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">And half an hour passed and the lights didn’t come back on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">And I said, you know, something’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">We called up and we found out the whole <span class="REGION">east coast</span> was blacked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">I don’t know whether you remember the big blackout. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">And I said Ben, I don’t know whether we’re going to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> aren’t running, everything is closed down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">I just made a telephone call, the whole <span class="REGION">east coast</span> is blacked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">I don’t — can’t — don’t think I can leave you here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">And he said well, you know something, I — if you'll help me I — let’s go up to my <span class="BUILDING">club</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">He was a memory of the <span class="BUILDING">Harmony Club</span> up on <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span> , which was up on <span class="DLF">60" Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">And I said, all right, come on, I’1l help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">And we — poor fellow, he walked down 21 flights of <span class="DLF">stairs</span> with his cane, and we started walking uptown. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">It was an extraordinary night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">You know, people didn’t know what was happening, it was the height of the Cold War, people thought that the Russians were sending missiles over and bombing <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and we were going to be attacked any moment, and there were all kinds of fears everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">People were praying, it was just unbelievable what was happening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">And we were walking up <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span> , straight up <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">And Ben got pretty tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">We were up near <span class="DLF">50" Street</span> and he was kind of exhausted by this time, and March 10, 2001 there was Saint Patrick’s Cathedral right there next to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">And I said Ben, you know, why don’t we go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and sit down, you know, you can use a spell of rest, and I — and he said you know AI, that’s a good idea, let’s go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">So we went to Saint Patrick’s cathe — <span class="BUILDING">Cathedral</span> , which was amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">It was lit up by candles and people, you know, they were afraid, they didn’t know what was happening and they were praying and 1-it was an extraordinary sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">And we sat down, we just sat and relaxed for awhile until — and I observed all this, the people crying, people in fear, people not knowing where they were going to go, people just resting like we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">And finally Ben said okay, I think I’m up to going a little bit further. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">And we marched from there the next 10 blocks to get up to the <span class="BUILDING">Harmony Club</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">We walked in and he said, come on up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">We went up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> , wherever it was and there were these huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">leather chairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">And we just plopped down and he said okay, now what will you drink? </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">And we had some scotch and really just enjoyed that evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">And eventually I think I found my way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by — I left Ben there, I knew he was taken care of and I found my way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with a group of other guys in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">That’s what I remember about Ben Livingston

<p><span class="sentence" id="1298">QUESTION:  So you’re still in this — in the same business?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1299">ANSWER:  Yeah, the business was — went quite well for many, many years and in 1991 we had some very bad luck, we — we had a — an operation with, or a — a joint venture with an organization, we started a company in <span class="COUNTRY">Puerto Rico</span> with a man who would — March 10, 2001 we thought we could trust and as often these things happen, we couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">The — the trust was not — was not well placed, and we lost an awful lot of money na — in that particular year, so much so that we had to go out of business [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">And we joined — we — what we wound up doing was set — discharging our employees, which I think was probably one of the most difficult things I’ve ever had to do, let people go, tell them that we just couldn’t carry on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">And we went — we joined a — another organization, Stemcor at the time, whom we sold ourselves to for practically nothing because they didn’t believe we could do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">So we said okay, we’ ll make a deal with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">Here’s what we want to earn and if we don’t earn it, you don’t pay us anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">So we were at risk and if we lost money we were prepared to make it up to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">And so we went to work for them and it didn’t take very long, we hit it just right and in three years we had recovered practically everything we lost on the other <span class="BUILDING">company</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">It was — we did exceedingly well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">And it came time to renegotiate the contract and we renegotiated it and then — for two — for two more years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">And then they got kind of jealous by how much we were making, and you know, th-these things happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">We got into arguments about why aren’t you paying us and they wanted to create all kinds of reserves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">Well, you — you — we’re not going to pay you now and we’ll pay you later and we said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">And after two years we closed that up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">Actually, there was a lawsuit that resulted from the — the closing of the Livingston organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">The <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> has lost some money in that transaction as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">89March 10, 2001 End of Tape Three, Side B March 10, 2001 Beginning Tape Four, Side A

<p><span class="sentence" id="1317">ANSWER:  Yeah, so we — we were working for this organization, the name was Stemcor and we had, when we joined them we did exceedingly well, we had renegotiated our contract. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">And we were also involved at the time, together with Stemcor in a legal matter, which stemmed from the old business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">And I remember the president of that company, Ralph Oppenheimer came over to see me and we went to see — talk settlement with the opposing parties, who were the banks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">And the judge demanded that we settle for, I think a million dollars was the settlement — would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">And I remember taking the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> back with Oppenheimer from the — from the <span class="BUILDING">courthouse</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">And he said, Alfred, you are going to pay your share of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">And we had had an agreement that we would not, if there was such a situation we would not have to participate in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">And I said no, we’re not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">We have an agreement and we’re going to stick to our agreement. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">We stuck to ours, now you stick to yours. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">And he said well, you know, if you don’t, I will not renew your contract. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">And I said all right, if that’s the way you feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">So I—I believe I said, that’ll suit me just fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">You know, I was sick and tired of that — running into that kind of an argument with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">And I kind of felt I must have a lot of my mother and father in me, because they would March 10, 2001 have done the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">They would have said no, a deal’s a deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">Let’s live by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">And so we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stemcor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">We then proceeded to have three more years with another British company where we managed for them the organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">And as of the beginning of last year, Anita and I have been conducting the business on our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">We — th-that business end that they didn’t want — that they had to pull out of the organization because they had problems in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> because of the economic problems that the Russians had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">So the English really said th — we need to get out, we need to have somebody buy us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">And we couldn’t find anybody to buy them out so they decided well then we’ll — we’ll leave you and we’ run it ourselves and maybe close it up, though I don’t know what they planned to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">But we started our own business as of the end of — at the beginning of this year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">And we’re — just the two of us are operating it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">That’s very, very — it’s a lot of fun, and we enjoy it, it’s our life and — and we continue to carry that on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">That’s been successful, so — you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1344">QUESTION:  Do you take any business trips to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1353">QUESTION:  And when did you get married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1354">ANSWER:  Well, I’ve had — this is my second marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">My first marriage, I married in — when I was quite young, 22 years old, 1953 and had two children and divorced after 35 years of marriage, then married Anita after the divorce became final, about three years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">And we’ve been married now exactly 10 years, and happily so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1357">QUESTION:  And your children’s names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1358">ANSWER:  Well, Andrew, who is now fif — 44. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">And Nancy, who is now 42.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1366">QUESTION:  Let’s talk now a little bit about your thoughts and feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">Do — do you think you would be a different man today than if you had had a different childhood than you did and ha-had to go through the things that you did? </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">The difficult times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1369">ANSWER:  Absolutely, I think I would be very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">I think that history and your upbringing, your experiences as a young — as a young man do form your later life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">March 10, 2001 You know, you can’t purge yourself of the knowledge and the feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">They stay with you all your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">And no matter how young you are when you experience these things, they remain with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">They remain with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">I don’t think that I would ever feel entirely comfortable or at all comfortable in any <span class="NPIP">place</span> where Jews were looked at as inferior or being something less than what the rest of the citizenry of whatever <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that is, was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">I don’t think that I would have formed my feelings of social justice if I had not gone through what I went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">Perhaps I would have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">I guess a lot depends on the kind of education you have, on your parents and how they feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">I am enormously offended by people who unfairly oppress others in — in any manner, and object to it violently when I — when it’s so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">I — so all those things come from, I think, my past. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">I have no patience for people who try to bully others in any shape or form. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">I think that also stems from my childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">And I have a deep sense that history somehow will repeat itself someplace in the same way, and my God, we have seen it in our lifetime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">We’ve seen the oppression that are visited on people everywhere in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">They may not be oppression of — of the Christians against Jews or — or the Nazis against — committing genocide against any number of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">But you do have it, you have it — you had it in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> very recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">You ha -- it’s happening all over the world, it’s happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">It’s — and I have no patience for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">I — a-and — and I know what people come away with who live through such times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">How we had it in our own hemisphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">Y-You do have to feel for the Cubans March 10, 2001 who were displaced by Castro. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">Certainly some of the things that happened to them were totally unfair to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">So all those — all those things and how I feel about them came about by what happened in my lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1394">QUESTION:  When you were young, you — you had some experiences where you, you know, saw th — you saw parades or you saw symbols that were very repugnant to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">Is there anything today that triggers that in you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">Any sights, or any sounds that you sometimes hear flash back to your very early childhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1397">ANSWER:  I think them — that kind of militarism, certainly it exists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">It existed in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> under the communist regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">It probably exists in <span class="COUNTRY">North Korea</span> today, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">But it — it existed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in a very, very special way, and I don’t think it’s — 1-it’s exactly the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">The Germans made a specialty of it, and they did so historically for many, many, many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">I mean, you go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bismarck</span> and even back further, the — the Prussians and their — y-you can go back to — to Middle Ages and the — the Germans and their — their mythology of — was always the — the hero worship and the loyalty to — to anything but — but a democratic society. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">They just didn’t have that in them, they were — th-they — they were st — they were the strong, the — the people made of steel, the ones who would show the rest of the world exactly how — how it would operate and I don’t know whether it was — 1-it sort of looked Wagnerian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">I’m sure it is in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">German philosophy is replete with this sort of thing, of — of the super race, which 1s what Hitler really played on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">I don’t see that elsewhere in the March 10, 2001 world, I am not seeing it elsewhere in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">Sure, people think we’re better than you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">There’s a group in the — in <span class="REGION">Africa</span> , when one ethnic group tries to annihilate another, sure they think they’re better than they are, but they don’t try to set themselves up as a super race, as somebody that could dominate the world, and the Germans always managed to do that, or they have in the last 150 years anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">Or maybe not so right now, but they did before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">And so this militarism that I saw there and experienced there, I think is unique, or was, at least in my view, was unique to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1411">QUESTION:  When your children were growing up, and they were five, six, seven, eight, when they were the age that you were when you had to leave, di — was that a difficult time for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">Did it bring back those times?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1413">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">Never thought about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">Never, never thought about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">We’ve told our children what I experienced, but I think it was very, very far removed from their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">Now —
QUESTION:  Was your first wife born in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1418">ANSWER:  Yes, she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">Nancy has talked at great length to my mother, and they were very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">So she has had the opportunity to experience first hand from her, at least, or let’s say secondhand, what transpired, and I think it has affected her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">Also, her life in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , she has certainly come across many, many people who experienced much more traumatic events than I did, and whether they were all relayed to her, or March 10, 2001 whether she learned anything from them, I don’t know, but the opportunity certainly was there for her to do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">My son I don’t think really thinks about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">He knows that his grandparents came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , that they left on Kristallnacht and that they had to get out and that many of the family was caught up in the Holocaust and lost their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">But I’ve never questioned him about it, how he things about it, and maybe I should, but maybe it’s a failure of parenting on my part, that this is not such an important thing in his life or such an important thing in the grandchildren’s lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">I’d like to make it that way but I’m not sure that you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">I really don’t think you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">I think there has to be a — an interest and if that interest is spawned at some stage or another by them, by their education or by what they experience, then it may be meaningful and then they’Il come and ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">One would hope they would, and I’d be prepared, of course to discuss it with them in any way they wished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">But I’m not sure that that will ever happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">It’s not likely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1431">QUESTION:  D-Do you feel German in any way now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1432">ANSWER:  Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">I grew up in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">My — I feel as American as anybody who has been born here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">I don’t feel German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">People ask me where I’m from, I’m more likely to say that I grew up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forest Hills</span> , I’m not likely to say that ’'m from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">Sometimes when I’m abroad and people ask me where I’m from, I ee — I — I might say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">I don’t know why, I guess maybe it might impress the people that I’m talking to, so it depends who the audience 1s and what I choose to let them know, March 10, 2001 or if I feel it might make an impression, but 1t seldom makes an impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">I think they are much more likely and — to look at <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> the way I did when I was a youngster, and they idolize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">It’s a culture that has, the American culture has — has gone all over the world, much, much more so than it was when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">So we Americanized the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">Well, that’s a good thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1444">QUESTION:  Are you angry that you had to go through what you did as a very young child because you were Jewish and that you lost all these relatives because they were Jewish and there’re other people who didn’t have to do that, people in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> your age, who were born in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">You angry about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1446">ANSWER:  I don’t harbor any anger at all in that respect, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">I understand that people go through — have different experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">There are many Americans who have gone through very traumatic experiences of their own. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">May not be of the s-same nature, but certainly they — not everybody lives an I — an idealistic life, they have their own — they have problems, etcetera, and they — they’re very meaning — meaningful in their lives, just like my adventures in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and my leaving was very meaningful in mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">So, do I have an a — do I have anger? </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">No, none — none whatsoever, none, none. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">The only anger that I harbor are those people who deny that it ever happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">And those who by their ignorance want to propagate that sort of thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">The Fascist groups that arise, the intolerance that you sometimes see in people, that angers me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">But I think it angers many Americans, not just those who left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">March 10, 2001
QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">Were you in any way active in the Civil Rights movement here in the 60’s and 70’s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1458">ANSWER:  No, no, I didn’t participate in any active fashion there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">We saw what was happening, of course, and I think we rooted for the right <span class="NPIP">side</span> , but aside from a rooting interest and a — a-and looking at some of the things that were going on and abhorring it, the — the — the standoff at the <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> and etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">These were — that it was happening was probably very good for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , that it — that all this existed, that that kind of discrimination existed here was not a surprise to me because I had known it existed, and here a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was going through it and was purging itself of it, hopefully. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">You see, I think the difference between American society and German society is that in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> under Hitler, institutionalized discrimination and hate and made it a government policy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">I don’t think that can happen here, not under our Constitution and under our laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">And not only can’t it happen here, the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was founded on the basis of exactly not allowing that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">The Constitution was written with this in mind, by people who were very farsighted, many years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">This wasn’t the case in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">So there’s a tremendous difference here, there and — no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">I don’t — I really don’t think that there 1s a parallel to be drawn between what has happened here in the Civil Rights movement to what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , there is no parallel.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1468">QUESTION:  What are your feelings about the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">March 10, 2001
ANSWER:  Well, I’m a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">I believe that the state of Israel was a — was heaven sent for the Jews all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">I’m fully in support of a Jewish nationality and a state, totally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">I don’t like what I see is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">We can’t make peace with our neighbors in the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> , which is a sad, sad state of affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">I’m concerned that there will never be peace in the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">There are just too many hatreds dating back too many years that these things cannot be forgotten by the people who are involved in it, for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">For the Palestinians, this is their Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">May not be of the same magnitude, but it’s not any easier for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">And I don’t think that the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> has done what it can to relieve that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">I think they can do more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">Now, whether the Arabs will allow them, you know, these are the questions that are tearing at everybody today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">You know, we can blame each other back and forth for a thousand things and find all kinds of excuses why it isn’t done, but some — somewhere, somebody has to sit down with somebody in th other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and they have to talk sense to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">And will that ever happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">I sure hope it will and I’m an optimist and I think eventually it may. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">Maybe not in our lifetime, but hopefully it will, although, as I said before, I’m an optimist there, but I’m a pessimist as to whether it’ll ever happen.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1504">QUESTION:  Do you feel that you lost any part of your childhood, you were so young when you had to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1505">ANSWER:  Honestly no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">My childhood from my — from my formative years was spent here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and didn’t lose any of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">I was a happy child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">I was — my family made sure that I was secure, despite the fact of what we were living through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">And despite the fact what I observed, I never, never felt a personal threat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">So no, I didn't miss anything in my childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1511">QUESTION:  Before we conclude, is there any message you want to give to your grandchildren on the tape? </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">Anything you want to say? </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">March 10, 2001
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">It would be wonderful if all, or even any one of them took an interest in those years, those very important years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">Ill speak directly to them, you certainly came from at least one parent who lived through history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">And it behooves you to know a little bit about your background and where you came from and why you are here at all, cause at any time in those early years, when I was younger than you are now — or maybe not, maybe some of you are just about the age that I am now — that I was then, anything could have happened that it would have made life very, very different, it would have — you would never have been born if it weren’t for the fact that your great-grandfather had the foresight to find his — and the struggle and the ability to find his way out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">And there’s another thing I think that you should remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">What happened then was the act of a government in concert with its people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">You have an obligation to look, and to take part and to observe your government in action, to be certain that something like this can never happen where you live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">You have that obligation and you must use whatever effort you have, or whatever influence you have to see to it that justice for all 1s a part of your life and is a part of the national life wherever you may be living at. </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">So do that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1523">ANSWER:  No, I think you — you well covered everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">Yes, there is one other thing I have to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">I said we stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">Whitehall Hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , it was not the <span class="BUILDING">Whitehall</span> , it 102March 10, 2001 was the <span class="BUILDING">Cumberland Hotel</span> on Speaker’s corner and the Hyde Park corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">And that’s important, I don’t like to make mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1527">QUESTION:  Well, that’s — I’m glad you am — remembered that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">Thank you very much for doing the interview and this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Alfred Schnog.</span></p>
