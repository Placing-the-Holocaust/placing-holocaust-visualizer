<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Should I spell it too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  No, you don't need to spell them because it's on the slate. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">And then I'd like to you tell me a little bit about your childhood and background before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> on August 8, 1920, son of a middle class family. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My birth parents were fairly well to do people, not rich though. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My mother was a full-time mom. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">She used to sing in the <span class="DLF">path</span> when she was young, but her career ended before I was born, I understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My dad was a locksmith and son of 1 of 13 children, and when his father passed away he had to assume the responsibilities of taking care of the entire family of 12 sisters and brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Naturally, he had to go to work to support his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">That's why he didn't finish <span class="BUILDING">school</span> yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Eventually when he married my mom, he graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , became a locksmith to survive and to earn a living, and then slowly in coming years he felt a need for education, and going to <span class="BUILDING">night school</span> , he became an architect. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">So I was raised in a middle class family. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Very, very happy childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I had a sister, was one year older than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We lived in a big <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> belonged to my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">The entire family, over 18, 19 people lived, there all my cousins so we see each other every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Naturally, as you live with your cousins, one try to outdo the other win, scholastically, otherwise, and this was promoted by the parents, particularly our mothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Now, I was playing violin since I was four and a half years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I remember my first violin was bigger than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I couldn't hold the violin properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I recall the tortured nights when they put cork between my fingers to stretch my ridge of my fingers to reach the <span class="INT_SPACE">octave</span> on the violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Naturally, this was not very promoting to my music career. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I never forgot the tortures, but my mother was thus in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> when I start playing particularly, the concert, or so we had a quartet; my sister playing piano, my uncle, my youngest brother of my dad playing cello, my other cousin was playing viol
ANSWER:  There was four people and I was playing violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Of course, we were playing for friends of our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I would rather be <span class="NPIP">outside</span> playing tennis or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">But this was a ritual that for years was an understandable thing that we have to do and I liked it actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">But anyway, until I reach the age of 13 I would say, I had the idea that I want to be a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I don't want to, would like to be a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I don't want to be a musician. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I knew I was not Heifetz or Perlman, but my mother would never understand that, and when I told her I wanted to be a doctor, this was like stabbing her in the heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">There were days I refused to practice ... and ... and with time of rebellion, a quiet rebellion. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">But then I had to do it, so after a day or two I start practicing again. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school of music</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Eventually I graduate ... in <span class="BUILDING">academy of music</span> , and I was full fledged violinist. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">In the meantime, my father was involved in expansion of a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">This was a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic high school</span> where the principal was a bishop. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I recall seeing him on occasions, walking in his robe in <span class="INT_SPACE">hallways</span> , accompanied by a rabbi with curls, side curls, you know, and this fur hat, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">To me it was rather odd looking type of a connection here. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">We lived in the outside of <span class="REGION">area</span> where normally Jewish people lived, what they call Aryan are
ANSWER:  It was modern edifice and there were no Jewish people around there. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So my parents spoke Yiddish here and there, mostly Polish though. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I did understand Yiddish but I could never speak Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And one day, going back to the principal of the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , my dad asked him kiddingly, you know what, my son reaching the age now that you have to enter <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">What you think of my son considered being a student in your <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="45">He said "no problem." </span><span class="sentence" id="46">As soon as he passes the pre-entrance exam, he accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">There is no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">But then my dad replied, but this 1s a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> and we're Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So, ... the principal replied. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">We prefer a Jewish student in a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Believe it or not, I started studying hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I was a good student and I passed exam and the reality came through. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I became the first Jewish student in the highly Catholic school, <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Well, my days in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> were extremely happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">They were the best years of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I never felt I'm different. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I didn't look different, but on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , kids in the <span class="REGION">area</span> knew who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">They called me, you dirty Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">You filthy Jew, for no reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> I was never approached like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I was respected by my colleagues. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I think they liked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I was excellent student. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I was even assigned by teachers of certain class like French, Latin, geography, history, to tutor my colleagues from the same class that didn't do so well, and all of them went through and passed the exams. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So, I was very happy to hear that I was instrumental in helping my colleagues, and it developed a certain type of rapport with them, not because they are dependent on me, but it helped us to bind us together, I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And, I was very active in French club which I organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I was very active in an art club which I organized, and then musical circle too, and then eventually I was nominated by the director of the <span class="BUILDING">musical department school</span> to participate in our symphony orchestra in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , to a point on one day we had a contest in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of different symphony orchestras in different <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> and this took place in one big <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and won the first prize and I was playing solo forget like today and I thought, my mother was very proud of me then. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">She seen certain things, you know, that she hoped maybe I would fulfill a dream, and I was glad to give her this kind of satisfaction although, innerly I felt that's not the <span class="DLF">road</span> of my future. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I was just insisting I would do something else and occasionally we discussed this and my mom didn't want me to talk about it about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And there were different days you respected your parents more and whatever they say, really this was the way it was supposed to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Maybe I was the first one in our generation in those days, that made quiet rebellion against, quietly, yet in the beginning but persistently pursued further. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Anyway, my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> days were really fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Sundays was customarily thing that all <span class="BUILDING">boys high school</span> all in uniforms would marching to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I was in front with the band. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I was playing saxophone and clarinet in the band. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And then when we arrived in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , 800 or so students, went up to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and my <span class="DLF">road</span> led to the choir, and I was playing violin with the choir. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Naturally, I was quite acquainted with the rituals with the prayers for eight years I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there and I felt that I'm Catholic, except I was not baptized. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I had Christmas tree at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> next to Hanukkah. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And I had a, had a kind of natural thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">No one making fun of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">But then here and there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> when I went to the <span class="DLF">park</span> or so, I seen Anti-Semitic remarks, and knowing who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">One day I remember I was little. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">We went to the <span class="DLF">park</span> , wintertime, and one of my dad's employees took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">He was pulling me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">He was a professional wrestler, huge man, muscular man young in his 20s or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">It was a scene, a scene I never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Students of the <span class="BUILDING">local university</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Catholic university</span> attacked an older Jew, religious person with his side curls on, attacked him with sticks at the end which were razor blades. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">They are cutting off his side curls, and by doing this they chopped off his ear. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Blood was flowing and I never forgot. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I was a young kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">But they seen us watching them from a distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">They ran toward us, tried to attack us. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">But my dad's employee was very fast, athletic and so on, he pulled that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> fast and they were falling, you know, in distance and couldn't reach us. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But eventually, they blocked our <span class="DLF">path</span> , you know, and they pinned us against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">He made a mincemeat out of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">He beat them so up, you know, that eventually police came in and arrested him. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">The fact that we were attacked meant nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I think he put to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> then. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">This was one episode I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">But this never happened in my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> though. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">In <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I was person, that I was not a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I was respected by my teachers, professors, by the priests, you know, by everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">That's why my memories going back now to those days are really great. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And, I didn't realize at that time eventually, very soon afterwards this connection with my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and friends, colleagues, classmates, professors would help me survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So this is about my childhood, very happy with a lovely <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  When was that incident with the --
ANSWER:  This was probably in about '32, '34, 1933, '34, about five years or so before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">This was not an isolated incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">There were more incidents like this from then on. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">There was more German propaganda after Hitler came to power in '33. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Then you seen people very traumatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">In front of <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> , Polish people standing with signs "do not buy from the Jews, they steal your money." </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And in spite of this, many people going to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> , and then they are leaving the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> they were someone taking their pictures and eventually, they were using those photographs, the photographs in those and placing the propaganda with the name of the people who frequent <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And I seen all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I was already confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Here I am in <span class="BUILDING">Catholic high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I thought I was Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And to me, being Jewish didn't mean nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">We are not a religious family although my parents had a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> , for one reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">All the Jews had <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">They felt that the meat was cleaner, more hygienic. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Meat was not bought from a peasant who slaughtered the cattle some <span class="NPIP">place</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , didn't know how hygienic was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So no one got sick from eating kosher meat or so, but that's the only reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">But otherwise, we are not religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But to explain yet my parents attitude towards me as their son, and to build up my identity although, they were not religious I say. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Once a year we going to the little <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> was actually somebody's like <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , where the Jews were praying all day long. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I remember that I was little boy then. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I couldn't wait until the service was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">There was so stuffy. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">There was no air conditioning and I would rather to go out and play with the kids, but here I am, stuck with older people, you know, for a whole day until you are allowed to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">You are not allowed to eat until sundown you know, so for a child, you know, this was ... but food was not a problem really, but those scenes you know, I remember until today. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And then to reinforce my identity who I was my parents hire a teacher which they call a Rebbe. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Rebbe is not a rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">It is someone whose very well versed in the Hebrew teachings, you know, and the religious laws and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And he was coming, I don't recall, three or four times a week to my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I remember he was falling asleep while he was reading to me and when he was half asleep, I was changing the book, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I was turning over the pages, you know, so we would get faster, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And when he woke up, half the book was turned over without him realizing it even. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">But, I got the touch of it anyway, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Not that I learned anything from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">But there is somethings I learned some things, prayers, you know, and but until today I was not very comfortable being in a <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> because I didn't grow up in that kind of surroundings you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">But I knew who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Then since there was a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic schools</span> and there was so many other Jewish students in different <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">None Catholic but state schools who didn't had no formal Jewish education. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So once a week one of the professors of Jewish, of Jewish history was coming to our <span class="BUILDING">school Catholic school</span> teaching us about Jewish history, talking about the exodus of the Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> and all the uprisings you know, the Jewish history and we, so more or less were not ignorant about those things and then were graded on the base of his report. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">But I was also graded on New Testament, which I attended, so I was graded on the New Testament and also the Old Testament and religious education, and I had two grades. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And this was very happy solution to me until summer of '39, prior to September 1, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Rumors of Hitler Army moving, probably to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">We invade <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">We on vacation at time, summer vacation and of course, most of the Jews belittle the rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">All Jews all rumor this and that, but as a precaution they decide to cut short vacation and come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Sure enough, September 1, '39 war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Polish Army didn't last too long, Within less than two weeks, or three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">The whole army fall apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Our government left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , first to escape, and only one that stood up yet was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , was defending self for several weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> have a hell of a time, the whole of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was invaded already and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was still fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">In the meantime the Germans entered our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">First thing they did, all the Jews have to register. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">All the Jews have to give up their possessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Their music instruments, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> , grand piano, furs, jewelry, <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> , whatever was of certain worth to them they had to give it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And of course, means of communications, telephones and radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Germans were afraid of the local population listening to the radio, to BBC maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So we're not allowed to have the radios, and one day I remember my dad came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> bloodied up. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">He was beaten by the Pole and the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">He was caught on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">He was there to do some work you know, some labor work that day and they beat him up as a prepay and sent him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">When I seen this, I seen what was to come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I recall we sitting together, the whole family at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , discussing what should we do. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">It was too late to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">West we couldn't go, wanted us to know that <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> divided <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">The Soviet Army actually came from the East going West and they stopped at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Bug</span> and the German Army stopped at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Bug</span> too and our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was slightly west of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Bug</span> so we were at the fortune to be under German occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Some of my colleagues, Jewish colleagues, decided to go eastward, to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">With the blessing of my family, I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">My parents provided some cigarettes for me, for this was the best means of bribery and money didn't mean nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So if you want to ... were caught by anyone, especially Soviet solders, by giving a carton of cigarettes you buy your way out. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">There was not documents except the old Polish documents, and took me about a week to reach destination far east in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">A little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Why do you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="178"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where my uncle, the younger brother of my father lived, and I thought at least I find somebody a relative of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I arrived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">My ultimate goal was to enter the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there and study medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">But I was not accepted, maybe as much as good as I thought I will be. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Mainly, because food was a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Staying in this small, cramped <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">He was married. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Had one boy, baby boy, and I know it was very difficult for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So I try to spare them the problem and I decided to leave and go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , the Germans call <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lemberg</span> , which was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , about 250,000 people, site of <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , formally under the jurisdiction of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Many intelligent people spoke German, and it was just a beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and I was very fortunate to take my pre-entrance exam and be accepted in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Now you have to understand, that I was a refugee. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I had nothing with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I had no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I had no clothing except what I had with me and I was hungry most of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">But I still felt ... Lalways promised my parents I would pursue my education and that kind of an obligation I felt I should fulfill, and for myself too. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I always wanted to be a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So I was smart enough to find my way through and I was employed by the <span class="INT_SPACE">school cafeteria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I cleaned the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I was getting three meals and then knowing the people, then slowly, I was fortunate enough to secure myself a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for students, like a <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And I was paired with another student, also a refugee from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">We became good friends and I was doing well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">QUESTION:  This is 1939?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">ANSWER:  '39.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">QUESTION:  And you were how old then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  I was 19. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And through 1940 I was doing nothing but studying. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I wasn't hungry no more, and that's a time that we didn't have no communication with my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I was very bothered with the fact that I didn't know what was going on with my parents and my older sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">There was no way you could communicate there. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I sent a few messages through people, peasants they used to smuggle items going one way or the other to the <span class="DLF">border</span> , but allegedly they never received letters from me, which I later found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">One day who knocks on my <span class="DLF">door</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I open the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Who is there? </span><span class="sentence" id="211">My dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">He swam through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Bug</span> and being pursued by the Germans and the Russians, arrested by the Russians as a spy and he bought his way out, explained he was not a spy, a Jew looking for his son. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">They let him go. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Happened to be a Jewish officer understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">He came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">He found me and looked at me and he was crying because I never looked so dilapidated, so abandoned like. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And I didn't have a coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I didn't have a blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">At night I covered myself with my overcoat, my blanket, but I was not cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">But he didn't get used to this picture because I was always well-dressed and a well-to-do family, and so on and here -- I try to explain to him not to worry about me here. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">At least nobody is going to kill me here. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Nobody was going to shoot me. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I still get my education and I asked him maybe to stay with me, and we looked for ways to bring my mother and my sister to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">There was no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">My dad refused to do that. "</span><span class="sentence" id="226">There was no way to do that." </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And he is stay with me for a few days only. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I remember today, he sat on my coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">A button was missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">He said, if your mother would see that she would be very unhappy. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And he got a button someplace and a thread and sew the button on my coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I never forget those little things ... Then we parted...while I thought I would never see him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">But the meantime life was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">1941, July, war again. </span><span class="sentence" id="236"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in spite of their pact with the <span class="REGION">Soviet Russia</span> , they invade <span class="REGION">Eastern Poland</span> and first thing what happened, Ukraine students in the <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> , Knew who was the Jewish student. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">They grabbed me, one of my good friends, Ukrainian, grabbed me beating the hell out of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Forced me to scrub the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of a <span class="BUILDING">pub</span> they had opened up for German officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">From then I was taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> in <span class="DLF">Janowska street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">It was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , but the way they treated us was just like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">We lying on wooden boxes really. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Not in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , boxes. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">There was nothing to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And we had to be on a <span class="DLF">field</span> at 5 am. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">wintertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">If you didn't stand straight, they beat you. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">They kick you from the front, from the back, from the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">You couldn't go down or they would shoot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So the awareness of not to go down, the beating always kept me aware of it, to stand up and I was numb. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And after a while I didn't feel the beating even and then maybe at 7am. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">or so we marching to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to work, and after a few days I thought well, there was nothing to expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And, where you going to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I run away to the <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">That's the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">However, I found three of my colleagues, Jewish students, hiding in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">How they escape I don't know, because they went through the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> very thorough, using the Ukrainian police with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">We decided to go eastward. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">The Russians were still not too for from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , so hiding, going to the <span class="DLF">fields</span> at night or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">We try to stop some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian trucks</span> so they can maybe pick us up so we can go with them east to Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Well, they pointed their guns to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">They didn't know who we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">They were afraid too. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">They were running away themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So walking about 70 kilometers, mostly during the night, some during the day, especially through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> so we would not be visible. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">We reached the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zolochev</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of about 35,000 people, I would say 80 percent Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">With my luck, wouldn't you believe we walked in at a time when there was a big pogrom taking place. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Right away we were caught by the Ukraines, brought us to a square, town square and put in front of a small <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which was the <span class="BUILDING">administrative building</span> , I understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Here in front of us were bodies of Jews, piled one on top of each other, dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">They said to line up, four of us, with hands up, and there were about few thousand maybe 2000 to 3000 spectators in the town square, mostly <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And we seen the SS or Gestapo, I don't remember which. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I think it was SS and firing squad. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Before you knew you were there, right there and we supposed to be executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Well, you know, this moment my whole childhood went through my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I close my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I seen everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I remember first time, I recall any event which was a funeral when I was five years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">From then on, my childhood, my sister, my parents, my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , the principal, the bishop, everything until this moment and like a movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I said, that's a very short life though. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And I didn't hear nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I just became totally numb. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Maybe it's like a self-defense mechanism with your body that if you know that you were facing your final hour, maybe that's what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I was never a victim of execution. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So you don't know how to behave. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">It was so quiet, so peaceful, and I didn't hear a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And I was totally frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">There were four of us lined up and I was second from the left. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And then after a while, I don't know how long it lasted, I slowly opened my eyes, slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I thought, I cannot be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Its so quiet and peaceful. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Where am I? </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Slowly, I turn to the left, slowly to the right, mostly with my eyes only, and I seen my colleague to the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">The last one was slumped over on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , so I didn't know if he was dead or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">But all my other colleagues, one on the left, one on the right, were standing like myself, erect and still. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Slowly I turn more and more and I look around and I see nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Totally turning around I look, thousands of bodies on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I don't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">They looked like Muslims praying, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And they were all dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Making a long story short, I found out that two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian planes</span> came in, seen a gathering with the police and the German and they start shooting and bombing the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">One colleague was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">We believed he was most likely killed by the Russians accidentally, not by the execution, the firing squad. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">When see what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">The three of us grab my little suitcase, tiny little satchel actually, and run to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">The pogroms were still going on in the rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">We hid in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , up to our necks. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">We took some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> to cover our heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">We stayed there at least three or four days or nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Until we frozen to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We couldn't stand it no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">We were hungry, exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">We didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">We're desperate and we just didn't care what happened to us no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So we decided to get out the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and walking toward some <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> we heard Ukrainians say, Oh, three more Jews not killed? </span><span class="sentence" id="316">How comes? </span><span class="sentence" id="317">You know, we kept walking, walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I don't know how we happened to -- we walked into a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , <span class="BUILDING">local hospital</span> , happened to be a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Pogrom was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Whoever was killed was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Thousands of people were killed and they accepted us. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">They fed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">They cleaned us, gave us some clothing and shelter and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and asked us to work in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">But I didn't know what happened to my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">This was a very close-nit family and I had to find out if they were still alive or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I didn't know how to make contact with the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">So I decided to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lemberg</span> , which was my <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , and I thought we knew some Polish people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Maybe somehow they heard something, what happened to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">So again, smuggling our way through, all three of us went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> and I did visit one of the families. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">They didn't hear nothing but they say they will be able to transfer some of my message to the family if I know the address. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">But I didn't know the address. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">But there was no problem finding where the Jews are living now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">After a while, someone came to me, I was staying with those people, the Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was not fully forming yet at that time so Jews were moving around, not freely, but they could move around. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">They had to be at dusk in their <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And a Polish fellow came to me and said my father contacted him to bring me back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">He was a cab driver who drove all night, only during the night, so he wouldn't be caught either. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">He had some false papers on some kind of Polish mission and I went with him back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , leaving my two friends behind, not knowing if we ever see each other, saying good-bye to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Driving at night, we atrived <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Of course, I found my family not in the original <span class="BUILDING">home</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">They were moved to a ghetto area which was behind ... the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the Jews used live there before, was a <span class="DLF">gate entrance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">You had to go, pass through, show your ID You go could to work through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> again into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">My father worked as an architect. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Again, he worked for the German railroad, so right away I was a medical student. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">But he got me a job on the construction of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> as a medic. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">I had a white band with red cross on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I didn't have nothing else with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I could do nothing for anybody who got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I didn't know nothing about. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Anyway, I was not a doctor yet, but this was a way of surviving, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And with him every day to construction and I made a lot of contacts there with many Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I contact some of my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends and they were happy to see me I was still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">They ask me what they can do for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">At that time I didn't know what they could do for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">We are not still in the situation very desperate yet ... and ... we were going through several selections what they used to call. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Selection was the means of when the Germans coming to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">One night they arrive, maybe one in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">They want to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">grand piano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Where we going to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">grand piano</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="360">We were not allowed to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">grand piano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Remember, in '39 all the Jews have to give up all the musical instruments. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">So they didn't care where to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Buy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Where you a going to buy a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> at one o'clock in the morning even if you have the money? </span><span class="sentence" id="365">So the people had to be taxes, I don't recall the sum of money needed, but early the morning they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they bought a grand <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> and delivered a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">grand piano</span> to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">So we got a reprieve. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">A month later another selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">People were not necessary for the German government to sustain the war machine were eliminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">They were selected left, and right, left and right, and whoever was not needed were disappeared actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">They took them by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they left, no one knew where they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">We were fortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">We were still together, the whole family until about April of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">In 1942 in April, the rumor was that the Germans are going to move all the Jews outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , there special <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> made for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">It's going to be like a <span class="BUILDING">summer home</span> for the Jews there. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Little <span class="DLF">gardens</span> we could go till our soil, and we still working for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Whoever is working 1s going to be working. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">From about 60 or 70 thousand Jews there were only four thousand Jews left then. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Mind you, that many Jews were eliminated during my absence when I went East. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">So I came back there was just about 4000 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">We had to march by the foot about 15 kilometers without belongings to new <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span

</span><span class="sentence" id="612">This was a good profession to be in. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Without hesitation I raised my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I mechanic. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I never touched anything mechanical in my life, but many people were doing the same thing, and they took me on the side and one mechanic came in, turned out to be a Jewish boy too, and ten of us we took the <span class="BUILDING">police garage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">They gave us some quarter there, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">They fed us good and asked us to work on their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I admitted to the man, chief mechanic, that I have no blind idea about mechanics. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">He said, shhh, be quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">We'll help you what we can. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I'll tell you what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Just unscrew this portion and then oil this part and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">We'll tell you what to do so don't worry about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I'm running the show. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">You do what I tell you to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Was very nice about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And so I was there for maybe a few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">We're fed well. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">We're not beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">The Germans usually say hello to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">The German Police, it was not the Gestapo, this was not the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And one day during the evening, one of the German officers approached me in the <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> and took me on the side and asked me, 1s it true you're medical student? </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And I said, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">He said look, I want you to be aware of it that as of tonight they're going to liquidate the <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> and they'll take you all of you away. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I don't know where, you won't stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">I want you to know there's a <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> on the left wing of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> there, and I will give you something to carry for me to the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> now and I will meet you over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I was very puzzled with the whole thing but you do obey orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I went there, I followed him, went there with this big box. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Then he show me behind where the horses are placed. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">there's a little <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">You stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">They will never find you there and at night after they liquidate this <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">You can stay until next day or so and somehow you have to get out of here and go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I'm bring you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">He went, came back maybe a few minutes later, and brought me a whole chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">He said, that's all I can do for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I can do nothing else for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I'm so sorry, and he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">I don't know his name, don't know who he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I know he was a doctor in German Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">He was not a Gestapo, he was not an SS man, he was not a policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">He was a physician, very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">In his upper 20s maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">That's the only benevolent act I have encountered from Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">QUESTION:  Did you hear something that night while you were hiding there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">ANSWER:  I heard some voices only, noises, but not very loud, and then everything was quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And the next morning <span class="DLF">gates</span> were opening and closing and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars trucks</span> moving out, and the whole regiment of the police left the compound and there was no one left behind, and I waited until night, following night, and I through the <span class="DLF">fence</span> I find my way back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , to the <span class="REGION">ghetto area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And I approach some of the Jewish people there and they let me sleep in one the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> there, and that's next day I went out to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with the work battalion. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And I approached one the Polish people that I knew from before who could contact my father, which I mentioned before. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">This was on one episode. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Then when I came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and prior to liquidation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> few days before, I did try to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">We did know that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was going to be liquidated completely and I tried to run away, and going under the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> were shooting at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">I was running like a wild beast and they wouldn't have caught me if not the police dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">He grabbed, forgive my French, my buttock, ripped a piece of flesh out and my calf and subdue me. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I was bleeding all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Then I was caught by the Ukrainian guards and they brought me back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and handed over to the Gestapo, and they start beating me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">They were beating me, standing behind me with a -- we call it a peitsche.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="667">What it was is actually is a handle made out of leather, hard leather, at end of which like a whip. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Actually was a hard, metal ball with points on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Standing behind me he was hitting me from the front so it was injured, my face actually standing behind me. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And I have a little scar and I... until today I am impaired vision in left eye ... was bleeding from the eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">But I couldn't go to a doctor of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I will stay like this until two days later until finally, when finally the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was liquidated and I escape again. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">With Lucine, my future wife and her little brother under a barbed wire, and you know the story then that we were hiding in the <span class="BUILDING">bishop palace</span> , which I mentioned before, then went to my father's friend who hid us in a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Then Lucine went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> to secure some papers for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Then she come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">We had the papers all together but no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Lucine remembered her parents left some jewelry and silver, a candelabra with a neighbor and a friend who lived in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">So we went to her and Lucine approached her. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Would you mind at least give us one candelabra so we can sell it, maybe find a way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> so -- and if we don't survive, whatever else my family gave you is yours. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">She said, well, but, you know, I don't have it in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Is hidden in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and I cannot go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> tonight because the neighbors would be very suspicious, what am I doing in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">But come tomorrow and I will prepare everything for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">I will wrap it so people won't know what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">Come back tomorrow at two o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Having a suspicious mind, and you felt a certain extra instinct, like a hunted animal, I just felt maybe the whole thing sounded fishy. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Instead of coming two o'clock, we approached the <span class="REGION">area</span> about noon time, 12:30. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Now, *peitche: whip. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">we're locating ourself across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the main <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that the lady lived, and this <span class="REGION">area</span> was bombed out, lot of ruins, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">You could hide very easily there, and behind us was a little <span class="DLF">street</span> and a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> like a <span class="INT_SPACE">street apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Actually, that my colleague from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">His father was a shoemaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I was tempted to go there, now stay there maybe and watch the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but then I didn't want to expose them to this kind of danger either. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">So I decided to wait on the <span class="DLF">street</span> behind the ruin, and sure enough about one o'clock we see two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">police cars</span> pulling over to the <span class="DLF">curb</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and two or four Gestapo people got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and rushed up stairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Within about 15, 20 minutes they came out and they split. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Two people went one way, the other two people went the other way, looking for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I assume they meant us. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">We didn't wait too long there. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">We knew she had denounced us to the Gestapo because of a silver candelabra. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And I just remember now talking about Judas sold Jesus and the situation was so analogous to it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">But anyway, we didn't know what to do so we run into my friend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">The parents recognized me right away, what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="702">I told them what happened very briefly and shortly. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Gestapo looking for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">What going to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And she very, old lady, you take your coat off. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Here, take your shoe off and start putting nails in your shoe, in my heel. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">She gave a apron to my wife and she was cooking something on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">iron stove</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Said, you pretend you cooking dinner right now and your little brother, put him to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="709">He's asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Now we'll cover him up with blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">There was a curtain separating a <span class="INT_SPACE">one room apartment</span> , a curtain separating the one bed area from the <span class="BUILDING">work place</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and this old lady took a blanket <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , start dusting the blanket, calmly, quietly. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">All of a sudden, two people approach her. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Did you see Jews here? </span><span class="sentence" id="714">So she pretended. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Jews here? </span><span class="sentence" id="716">There no Jews here. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">They all dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">There not nobody here. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Whose <span class="BUILDING">house</span> is that? </span><span class="sentence" id="720">My <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">My father's working here. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">My husband's client 1s here and my daughter is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">She cooking right now, dinner, and they walked <span class="NPIP">inside</span> to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Didn't ask for the paper, although we did have documents, false. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">They looked like they didn't believe they would be fresh enough to be so blatantly, you know, or stupid or to stay right near the scene of a crime. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And they left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and start looking for us again. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Of course, we didn't wait too much longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">We took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">That's when we went back to the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> the same night we took that horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> type of thing to the near <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Well, going back to the ghetto area. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">So, we lived in one little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and from there I had to go on to work detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Each morning a group of maybe 40, 50 people gathered in the ghetto area with a leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">The leader was a friend of my father, and with him we're going to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">We're unloading <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="735">They didn't beat us there but didn't pay us either. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Didn't feed us either. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">The only pay off was I could take as much coal as I could carry on my back as my payment for days work. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">So I of course, I put as much coal as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I was bent over on all fours practically, carrying the big sack of coal back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">It was cold but we couldn't afford to heat our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because this was all our food depend on the coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I was carrying to the third story with some the richer, older Jews you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">We were buying the coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">With the money we collected for the coal we could buy some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">We lived on carrots, cabbage, turnip from which, of course, we got diarrheas. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">We were sick, stomachaches. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">There was no bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">We couldn't afford any bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">There was nothing, nothing cooked. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">There was nothing to cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And on one of my trips I notice a familiar face in a uniform of a Polish railroad man and I thought, I know this face. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And as I said before, you develop a certain instinct. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">You just aware of your surroundings. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Who is around there. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Who, is he a friend or an enemy? </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And finally I approach him. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">I start working the <span class="REGION">area</span> he was standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I said do I know you? </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Aren't you from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="759">He looks at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">He said, who are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I said my name, it is Horn from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="762">He said, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Don't show any emotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I know you, yes, I am so and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">His name was Lowloc Rice (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="766">I said, I know, I thought that was you. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">He said, pretend we don't know each other, and let's not talk to long. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">What are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I said I wanted to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">What can I do to get out? </span><span class="sentence" id="771">So he said, why don't you come tomorrow again same time and we talk in details. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">I can't talk to you now right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">I couldn't wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with my sack of coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Next day early in the morning went back to work in the detail group and sure enough he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And he said, I can get you out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> but it cost a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">I said, I don't have no money but, you know what before I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , my father show me a spot in his <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> that he buried a case. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">It's a steel case with jewelry, gold, watches, bracelets, my family's jewelry, and one of our friends who was a jeweler. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Whoever survivor the war, if ever then you can live the rest of your life on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">I remember that <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">That's the only thing I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">I hope it's still there, but I cannot give guarantees. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">But I know this <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">If you were willing to talk to your people and they are willing to take a chance, whatever we will find, half is theirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">I need only a little bit to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">You can take more than half. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">I will leave it up to you, how much you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">How much you leave to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">He said, let me talk to my people. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">I said, who are your people? </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Well, I can tell you that that's Polish Underground, Armia Krajowa, or Home Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">They need money to buy ammunition, arms, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I don't know if they will go for this kind of deal because it is complicated, but if they will, I'll let you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">I will be here in a day or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">But I don't know what day, but I'll find you. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">So I was coming to work every day with the hope, my dreams kind of encouraged, maybe he'll find him. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Maybe is something work out. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Otherwise, I see the doom. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Sure enough, one day he's there, again same spot in the uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">He said, I talk to my people. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">They went for it, and on such and such a day you lead off. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Your leader of your group is part of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">He part of us, our group too. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">He knows all about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">So you will be snatched too. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">Make sure your wife goes to work too and her little brother too. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Children were going to work too. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">No one question anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And sure enough, at that given early in the morning by carrying a sack of coal to the side, we're snatched by a group of people from the Polish Underground waiting with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and then a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="810">We change <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcars</span> to different <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> and people were changing to our guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Our guards were changing. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">They all armed in case they caught us there would be a fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And we arrived to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , to an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> which one of the -- not <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> but one the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> were the Polish Home Army was meeting was meeting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">I was surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">We found maybe 10 or 12 Jewish people there, hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I found out that he is helping lot of Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">I looked at it and I met this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">I asked him why do you do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">The first man I seen so definitely show the effort and the risk to help the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="821">You like the Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="822">He said, no I don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">So why do you do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="824">Well, I show you. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">He took me another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="826">Now listen to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And I listened. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">There were noises over the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , people talking Yiddish, arguing and fighting with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">He said, what kind of people are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="830">I'm risking my life and here they start I fighting about, they fighting about stupid things and the neighbors they hear those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">They denounce it and we're all dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">I never see people in danger who do this kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I don't respect your people. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">I have no answer to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">What can I say. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">They're old orthodox people. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">For some reason they felt they should continue their orthodoxy, their sacred needs. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">They want kosher food. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">You know, where you going to get kosher food there? </span><span class="sentence" id="840">One of the men died, older man died, but he was very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">What the Home Army did, they put him in a an orthodox kind of a canvas sack. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">That's how the Jews are buried you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Not in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffins</span> , and they threw him over the <span class="DLF">wall</span> in the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="844">They didn't bury him there and but left him there in the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And I think this was more than anybody could expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">But this was just one the examples what those people did for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And, they described the whole plan what we're going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">First thing, I got the papers as a railroad man and they give me a uniform with a cap, a jacket, slacks, you know, the typical railroad uniform, with documents employed by <span class="DLF">railroads</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And he said, you going to go with a group of few people. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">One is a Volkes Deutch and I don't follow, Volkes Deutch is a German who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> for generations, but he still did not lose his German identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">He could be Polish patriot. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And this was, one was by your German. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">He was just an excuse to get all the country German Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">He knew where they are and he had a special privileges as a German citizen really, and he pretend to be always humiliated by the Poles and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">So it's special right and privileges. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">He was our protector on the trip on the rail to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> with guarded by two Polish Underground people, armed all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">We arrived at the scene and sure enough, the location used to be a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> was a <span class="DLF">street</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">The <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> was raised. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">To explain a little bit yet more about the situation, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> was at site where the Jewish POWs from the Polish, from the former Polish Army where stationed there, and they were doing the dirty work for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">They were digging in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="861">They are leveling the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="862">They were removing the door-frames, the <span class="DLF">window</span> -frames, the <span class="DLF">door</span> , the hinges, where the Jews were hiding gold and coins, and jewelry, diamonds, everything they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And they were taking everything apart piece by piece, and they leveled that <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> , the little <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="864">There was nothing ... but I seen the <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="865">I knew the <span class="NPIP">spot</span> right way. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And I said, I'm going to stand up on that <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="867">That's where it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">But he said, that's a <span class="DLF">street</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">He said, well, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">We'll come back tomorrow and we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">He took me to one of the <span class="BUILDING">people home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I stay overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">They fed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">They treated me nicely, and next day they took me back to same <span class="NPIP">location</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="875">What do I see? </span><span class="sentence" id="876">The whole <span class="DLF">street</span> is blocked off, detour. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">The signs of detour. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">Broad daylight. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">A <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> is erected middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> and the a sign, and A big roll of cable standing next to the <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">German Post Office</span> and telegraph. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And people, helmets and overcoats are digging in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> right where this thing is, the understand was when they find the case that I described. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">They lit a torch and this was a sign that they found it. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Now, I was hiding across the <span class="DLF">street</span> and behind a <span class="DLF">door</span> there was a little <span class="DLF">window</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">There were people passing. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">It was a big <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> and I was standing there, and looking through a little <span class="DLF">window</span> there and watching if they lit the torch. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">When this was torch be lit, this was a sign for me to get out and mean they got the case and they won't need me no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">They will take me away and we'll go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and, I am of course, I'm standing there, very nervous, very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Don't forget, this my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="888">I could run into somebody I knew, somebody knew me, and this would be the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">But I was guarded people with arms, you know, so I knew it wouldn't be easy for anybody, so they told me not to worry about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">If this happen that Poles recognize me they will fix him right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">Germans don't enter this <span class="REGION">area</span> anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">They were not concerned at all, but I was nervous and maybe took about two, two and a half hours, I see them stopping working and one of them reaching down and then straightening out and taking a torch and lighting a torch. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And I was sweating and I thought that was a sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">I was coming out right into the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> and here is the case opened up, completely empty, open up empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">I don't know what to say, but at least I knew this was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">They knew that I didn't lie to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">But where's the gold? </span><span class="sentence" id="898">Where's all the goodies? </span><span class="sentence" id="899">We found out later on that the Jewish POWs were digging everywhere and they opened this thing and left the empty case there and closed it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">They didn't report to the Germans cause the same day, understand, people are selling watches in the camps of the POWs. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">Watches and gold they were selling everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">Well, this was the end of our trip and I knew we were going back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because they did not receive what they are supposed to get. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">On the way back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> we talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">We had one <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="905">There was no other people there and I said, well, obviously we cannot afford to be out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="906">We cannot pay you people. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">I want you to understanding that I didn't lie to you about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">Yes, we know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">You going to send me back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="910">He said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="912">What would you do in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="913">You would perish in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="914">Maybe you can help us here on this side. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">You can work for your upkeep. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">We'll discuss the detail and come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="917">So we turn back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And you know the rest of the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">That important fact I omitted that we got married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> and my wife, with the help of the Polish Underground got us a little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , one little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="920">I was hiding there. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">I did go to a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">washroom</span> , boarding up the walls of the <span class="INT_SPACE">washroom</span> and creating a <span class="DLF">hiding door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="922">When you lifted the boards of the <span class="DLF">wall</span> was a secret <span class="DLF">door</span> that you open up, and behind the <span class="DLF">door</span> was a little hiding place accommodating maybe eight or nine people. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">I built a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> so we could lie there and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">Now this part of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was totally destroyed during the bombing of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , so there was a way we could have run away from this <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> any case of a danger, if someone entered the front of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , with a signal which was dissident in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">In case any danger, Lucine would knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> twice, and we would know to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">We did have an emergency address where to go, another <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> through the Home Army, hiding Jews in case of different <span class="NPIP">location</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="927">In case of emergency we could find a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> there until situation would clear up. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">And sure enough one day the janitor became suspicious because Lucine was bringing too much food in her little basket and he thought two women living in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and she bringing food galore, and he notified the Polish police. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">One day when she came in from work -- and what kind of work she was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">She was selling women’s nets on the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> , <span class="BUILDING">flea market</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">Nobody knew she was Jewish, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">She had good looks as an Aryan person. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">She seen policeman at the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="934">She didn't want to go in so she went to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="935">First thing she did was took the key out of her purse. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">She drop the key in a sack of beans and while doing this the policeman entered the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and arrested her. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">They when through her purse and ask her where her key. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">Oh, I guess I lost it. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">They look on the <span class="DLF">street</span> everywhere, they couldn't find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">Which is your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="941">What do you want? </span><span class="sentence" id="942">What do you want? </span><span class="sentence" id="943">We understand you are hiding Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">You are accused by the janitor that you bring too much food for two people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">We want to see your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="946">This conversation was very loud going on while they entering the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> , and on <span class="DLF">stairway</span> we could hear the steps of the boots and the noise and the argumentation. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">And then my wife said, there 1s nobody there unless my aunt is. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">She working too. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">She 1s not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> yet but let me knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="950">She knocked twice which was danger signal. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">And we also had some rabbits in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , just in case some neighbors hear some footsteps, we can always say the rabbits walking around. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">And they could hear some noise in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">Is there somebody in there? </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Well, maybe the rabbits. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">So they broke down the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="956">They look over. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">They went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">washroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="958">They did not discover our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> at all, although we are not there no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">They seen the rabbits and said, what are you talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And they left, but they took per purse with her, took her documents with them and she stayed without any papers which was like a death sentence. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">She discussed this thing with our friends from the Polish Home Army, and they suggested that one of them would go with her to get a copy of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And she went to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="963">Behind was a gentlemen armed just in case. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Without any difficulty she got a copy of ID and she left, no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">During one of the trips on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> they stole her purse again. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">She lost the documents again. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Same history repeat itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">She went back there and got ID, no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">I had to occasionally had to run from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I did need ID too, so the Home Army organized arranged for me to go with them to the main <span class="BUILDING">office</span> there with my real birth certificate of a person that passed away, young man was two years younger than I really was. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">His name was Wojick (ph), Felix Wojick. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">So I assumed his identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">So this birth certificate, I entered the main <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and I received a ID without any difficulty whatsoever, with two guards behind me. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">No one suspected anything and now I was equipped with real documents, and they could check it I was registered everywhere and I was not a Jew anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">But I had more Semitic looks than Lucine and with a man you know, it was not difficult to suspect something, stop him, put him aside, and take his pants down and know who we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Because only Jewish man was circumcised and this was the danger spot, but I tried to avoid situation like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">So Lucine was working for the Polish Underground actually, indirectly, and all the hiding Jews were doing the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">They were taught how to make woman's hair nets. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">It was a fashionable thing at that time to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">They were taking the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> inner-tubes or truck inner-tubes and cutting into small strips, very narrow strips. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">Then they could buy white silk and then they are dying the silk different colors. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">Was it a gold, gray, brown or black or navy blue. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">So making any net color you desire with the orders they receive. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">So I was taught by the group how to wrap this little string of rubber with a silk. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">So I was making the elastic, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">The other group people were making the nets themself by hand of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">And somebody design a little cardboard paper how to wrap it around and look very professionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">And Lucine, as having good Aryan looks with another lady, also Jewish person, good looks. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">They were spreading all over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , <span class="BUILDING">market places</span> and <span class="BUILDING">flea markets</span> etcetera, and our life was more or less stable from then on except I was like a prisoner in my own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which I readily assumed and took. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">I was taught how to do those things and finally our benefactor said, why do you start doing these too and do it on the side and Lucine can sell for you too. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">So be it. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">We did. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">We started to accumulated a little money. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">We felt a little more comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">We were not that poor no more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="995">QUESTION:  Was Lucine's brother still living with you then or is this after. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">What was it like hiding with him in that little <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicle</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="997">ANSWER:  It was very pathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">He was little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">He was like a prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">It was hard for him to understand why he was hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">He knew he was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">He knew he could not show his face although he had good Aryan looks, but as a kid they could pull his pants down, they know who he ts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">So was a sad thing to look at, him to be in hiding all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">He was pale. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">He was deprived of the sunlight, sunshine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">He couldn't play. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">I tried to be very near him, put arms around him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">He miss his parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">He was at the age he understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">He lost his parents and you couldn't replace it, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">There were times that he was questioning, asking if he ever going to see them again and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">He was still a child and on the other hand he was a grown-up, above his age. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">The political situation just forced the people to grow up very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">So he was aware of what really the score is and on the other hand, he was only eight or nine years old you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">I couldn't replace his father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">I was not old enough to act like a father, but I tried to do best I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">I try to be the disciplinarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">Sometimes he want to do certain things he want to do and so I say you cannot do it and I had to be firm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">And he tell, me you're not my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">I said, I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">I don't pretend to father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">But you cannot do it because all of us would be in danger, you including. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">So it was a very tragic thing to see him going through all this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">I did not mention that during one of those days that we were together, that we seen, when we run away from the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that the policemen arrested Lucine we went to <span class="NPIP">emergency hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">That's the time that Lucine run to one of her friends, who turned out to be the mistress one of the German Gestapo man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">She knew she was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">She said, what you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">She was afraid to tell anything, because we didn't know -- Lucine didn't know who she is now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">Is she pro Gestapo or is she going to tell everything where we are and then Gestapo come arrest us all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">But she finally told her, look, I am doing this because I am desperate myself to save my life you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">But you know I remember your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">I can help you maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">So she, Lucine, told her the whole story that the problem now is we don't have <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">We stay only a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">We didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">Next we have brothers with us and she said, you know, what this was is this <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Polski</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Polish hotel</span> , that the Germans with a lot of money taking people and they go to <span class="REGION">southern France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">The letters arrive from those people who went on transport to <span class="REGION">southern France</span> , writing back to their relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">Right at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , sunning ourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Life is different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">We waiting for visas to go to <span class="REGION">South America</span> to <span class="REGION">North America</span> , to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and I hope you can join us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">And Lucine seen those letters and they are truly letters, except that these people didn't realize this whole thing was a trick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">When we wanted to register they said, well, the next transport not going to a week later, but this time it was totally full but if you come up with like $5,000 actually, and we didn't have this kind of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">So talking to her friend we said, we cannot afford this kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">We want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">She said but, you know what, your little brother can take with you for nothing, but you have to come up with money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">So we said we have no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">So she promised to take her little boy with her, and on given day through, going through certain stages of hiding and before reaching that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> because you went in there was only Jewish people going in and who was going out, only Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">You didn't know if Gestapo waiting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> or not so it was a tricky thing to get in and get out of this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and one day we delivered the little boy to this young lady who was very nice, and took him under her protection on that trip to so called <span class="NPIP">paradise</span> , <span class="REGION">southern France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">We did receive one postcard from a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> someplace that everything fine from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">It was his writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">But did he really write what he meant? </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">Was he forced to write it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">We don't know, but this was the last thing we ever heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">The final thing what we heard actually after of the war, that the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went to <span class="REGION">Northern Germany</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> someplace to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and they were all eliminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">So, the whole thing was a stage, a plot from the Germans who knew that some Jews were hiding and they paying for the safety to Polish people, but some running out of money so they had to sooner or later get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">So they have some money left they could bribe their way by paying to go on transport to <span class="REGION">Southern France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">Unfortunately, we couldn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">We had no money, not that kind of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">So we stayed without her little brother and we assumed the worst because we didn't hear nothing for months to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">We suspected he probably perished, but for sure we didn't know at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">Life was going on and Lucine was selling her hair nets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">I making the hair net and off and on we lost our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> due to some suspicions that we had, maybe unfounded, but you couldn't take a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">So we jumped from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another one, always in contact with other hiding Jews, and they had our name and addresses and we had theirs in case their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was suspected of being not in order they run to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And one day one of her schooling girlfriends notify Lucine that her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> is no good and her husband 1s going to go to Polish Partisan, but he has to wait a few days and needs shelter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">So we took him to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">He slept to with us, one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , all three of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">And two days later he left us and went to Polish Underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">I understand he perished there and his wife perished too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">So we one day we looking again for another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">This was a constant situation every few months we looking for another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because people are not stupid and they suspect something and if unfounded even, they might suspect it and you can't take a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">They might call the police or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">One day she met a lady who was a nanny to one of her Jewish boyfriends when she was little yet, and she knew that the lady recognize her already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">And they hug and kiss and so and she was a widow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">They was peddling some ham, bacon, you know, from <span class="BUILDING">store</span> to <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">She had one <span class="INT_SPACE">room apartment</span> , little <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchenette</span> , that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">Lucine told her we're without <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">She said, why you don't come to me? </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">She said yea, but, you know who we are? </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">Oh, yes, I know who you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">You know what we doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">Oh yes I know what your doing but, I have to be paid for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">We have little money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">What will this cost us? </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">Normally reasonable cost us about 50 to 100 Zlotys per month, and I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">I think we paid her 5 or 600 Zlotys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">I'm not sure exactly the amount. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">That's what she requested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">She was very happy to get that kind of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">She was struggling economically. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">So we moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">Move in, we didn't have nothing to move in with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">A coat, a jacket, a pair of shoes, and I move my little <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">I was making those little hair nets, producing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">Lucine was selling it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">Now, we have to think about safety. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">I don't flush the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> because both ladies, Lucine and this house-lady, were working so I couldn't walk around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">I couldn't flush the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">I waiting until they came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> not to create suspicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">Floors were wooden. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">You afraid to put your weight down because the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> were squeaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">Be very, very, careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">I used to walk on the board next to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> where the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> was more solid and the planks wooden floor planks were not as flexible so without creating a noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">Then this was in the corner of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ceramic heater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">I don't if you're familiar with European heating system. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">It's made out of ceramic tiles, squares up to the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> almost, and connected to the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> , and you were heating with coal there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">There was a little <span class="DLF">door</span> , <span class="DLF">metal door</span> you put your wood or coal this was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">Well, I decided to do to hollow out that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">I disassemble the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">Lucine would bring me clay each day, a little bit in a bag, a little bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">I use a fork and a knife to disassemble without cracking the tiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">Don't forget this was old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , and from the base on I rebuild the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> using clay and water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And I remove the top, the surface, the ceramic tile and I made a wooden planking and put the tile on top of the wooden planking so I would get cover. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">But you have to heat it so what are you going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">So we bought a little iron <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> with a pipe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">The pipe was going right in the middle of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> into the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">There was a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stool</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> next to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> in case of emergency. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">I could step on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stool</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> inside the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">I was sitting like on horseback on the pipe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">Only thing I forgot not being professional, what am I going to do if the pipe 1s going to be hot because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> is being used for cooking? </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">Didn't think about it and I didn't think about the possible gases emanating from this contraption. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">I was not a scientist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">I'm not a professional bricklayer or stove layer, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">But it served purpose and I hope I would never have to use it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">All of a sudden one day we find out that the landlady had a cousin in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , who one day came in drunk, total drunk, and when he knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , I had only maybe a minute time to get into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">I got in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">He came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">They tried to get rid of him, he was so drunk they couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">I stay here overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">I go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">So I stayed in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">When he left following morning, I was totally unconscious, overcome by fumes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">They couldn't call a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">They couldn't pull me out because very awkward, was way up top to the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">They were two women, one old lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">Lucine was young but alone she couldn't do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">I was a heavyweight person and I started moving a little bit, but I was semiconscious and I got out of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> and they try to breathe in my mouth, artificial respiration, springing water, splashing water on me, and so on, and I come to it and I recovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">This was my first experience in <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">The other experience, I had, another cousin, a woman came one day with a little poodle or a dog, small dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">I had no time to get to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> so I hid in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> behind coats and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">All of a sudden, that little poodle start barking, coming toward the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> and barking and barking and barking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">Didn't want to leave, and this cousin of this house-lady said, what are you barking? </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">What do you see in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">Oh, I probably have a little ham there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">I'm peddling ham, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">He probably want this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">So she brought a piece of ham to the dog, give him the ham and he ate it and stopped barking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">And there were few episodes like this where I was hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">But each time I escape without any problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">Until one day our benefactor from the Home Army came to me and said to me, be prepared because the Polish Underground is staging an uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">In the meantime, prior to this of course, we're located next to the former <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">We see the ghetto burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">We see people dancing and 1s laughing outside the <span class="DLF">ghetto walls</span> saying the Jewish bed bugs are frying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">Finally, we got rid of them and so on, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">I didn't hear it myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">I just heard the noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">I heard the explosions in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">This was the Jewish uprising and we didn't hear no cries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">Nothing, just explosions, shots, and then the fire and eventually of course, after almost what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">Less than a month, the whole ghetto uprising, went under and the Germans sealed up the <span class="REGION">area</span> and there was no more <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">Then our captain came and said you better start storing some food because there is going to be uprising <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> proper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">We don't be able to get anything at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">If you have any money left, any savings or so, buy something for it because the money will be worth nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">Prior to this, he came to us once and he took a loan from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">He needed money to transport some Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">He had no money to save them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">So he was selling whatever he could, his own things to pay for the upkeep of those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">We gave him the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">He returned the money to us eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">So Lucine bought some rings that's all you could buy in the <span class="BUILDING">jeweler stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">You couldn't buy nothing else but wedding rings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">We ended up with several, maybe 10 or 11 rings which we could not get rid of afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">After the war they are worth practically nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">The uprising started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">Our Polish captain said, I want you to be part of our group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">We won't ask you to fight directly for us, it's not your fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">I said, your fight is my fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">You saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">Whatever you want me to do, I will do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">We need somebody to attack the <span class="BUILDING">German warehouses</span> to steal the provisions, food for our soldiers and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">It's under fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">And, I agreed to it immediately, and at night we're a group of five, six people from the Home Army ,Underground don't forget the <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> were connected to each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> next to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">They cut through the <span class="DLF">walls</span> of each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so we did not have to be on the surface, which was deadly, but underground we moving the whole underground city. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">We moving from one end of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> to the other end underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">And that's how we knew which was the exit where to go, where the <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> were and when we grabbed the supplies, what we could of course, we didn't have no transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">All on our backs, you know, and pockets, pants, hands, you tied to your belt, whatever you could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">We disappear in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">The German looking for us and couldn't find us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">We disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">Then that's how we brought the supplies for the fighting boys you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">Then the Germans seen that the uprising 1s continuing and decided to do more drastic type of move and they decided to bomb the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">In the meantime, the political situation change all bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">We already knew that the Soviet troops on the other side of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wisla River</span> , which the eastern part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> .’ </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">The name is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , like city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">People were hiding there that were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">We on the <span class="REGION">western part</span> were not liberated yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">Some Jews thought that in case they have to die now they try to swim through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wisla River</span> on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> going east, and they caught by the German fire of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">Some of them try to support themself with their hands under the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , holding on to different pipes and cables, only holding on with their hands cross the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> underneath to reach the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and some of them succeeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">Some of our friends did succeeded to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">It requires a tremendous physical strength to do that unless you accustomed to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">And many people undernourished and weak and so on couldn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">Even swimming through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wisla River</span> in the part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> which was pretty wide and deep was suicidal, so we wouldn't dare. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">So we took our fate the way it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">So the German troops start to bombing the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and they done it systematically, <span class="DLF">street</span> after <span class="DLF">street</span> , so we knew which street bomb today, so we knew which <span class="DLF">street</span> would be bombed tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">So running from one type of a <span class="DLF">block</span> to another <span class="DLF">block</span> , but the bombing caught up with us finally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">We are at our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that we stay with the Polish lady which I mentioned before selling ham and etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">The bomb hit one of our wings and the whole <span class="DLF">stairway</span> collapsed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">Lucine was upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">She went right onto the main <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> under the rubble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">I couldn't get to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> to save her so I took a plank, a wide plank, maybe a foot wide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">It was a corner wing and so I put one end of the plank on the window frame, the other plank was four story and the other <span class="DLF">window</span> , and all my fours I crossed from one wing to the other one, not looking down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">Because if I look down I probably get dizzy and go down, and I was able to reach her <span class="REGION">area</span> and recover her by pulling her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">I see her legs sticking out and by pulling her, debris and bricks and cement and piece of wood and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">She sustained fairly intensive injury and her whole right side of the face, ear, neck, chest, breast, right side of abdomen, was scraped from falling debris and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">Bleeding so on, I was wounded in the mean time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">I don't know what from. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">It was a piece of shrapnel I thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">My abdomen, I was bleeding a little bit but I felt good otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">I put her on my back and carried her on my back to the first aid station. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">There were signs in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where the first aid station don't forget it was our *<span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wisla River</span> : <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula River</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1222"><span class="REGION">area</span> , the Polish Home Army not the <span class="REGION">German area</span> yet, and I found my way to what they say is the lazarett.</span><span class="sentence" id="1223">° The lazarett and the first aid with the red cross on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">I bring her on my back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">I crawl in practically through the <span class="DLF">door</span> and whom do I find is a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">I almost fainted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">Then with together with Lucine on my back, my classmate who was my partner in crime and was supposed to be executed by firing squad, he was hiding in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">He finished his <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">He just whispered to me, we don't know each other, and that was all, I was the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">Lucine was the only one who get tetanus shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">There was not tetanus for nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">She was the only one who received it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">They tended her wounds and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">Squeeze my hands and couldn't hug and kiss each other and just wish each other best of luck and we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">And after several weeks, few weeks, I think about a month, the uprising went down under. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">German triumphed and they announced loudspeakers, all the inhabitants of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> now going to be evacuated to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> by foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">We walked several kilometers by foot to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> name <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruszkow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">I was wearing my uniform, had my bandages on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">Lucine had bandages on and at that time nobody suspected any Jews left, and we approaching the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we see a doctor there and several nurses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">Lucine thought they were nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">They were not nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">They were nurse and I told them I am a medical student and one of the doctor said "go to the right, go to the right." </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">This was the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> -- I forgot the number of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">We didn't know where to go to right or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">The first intuition was maybe we shouldn't, but why would he steer us wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">He 1s not working for the Poles, not for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">As we found a lot of older people meantime getting out of one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to another one, and we see an older lady, old lady on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> lying there, moaning, and no one was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">So I grab another guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">Why don't you help me get this lady to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and we carry the lady that behind us and they thought that we're part of the troop over there caring for the sick and disabled, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">We came to there <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and we see a lot of elderly people, sick people and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">And at this time I wonder if we made the right decision cause we know from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> days yet, sick and disabled people are garbage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">They going to be destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">Why didn't they put us with the younger people? </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">We young people,

ANSWER:  So we looking around the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and seeing all the older people we don't know what we're doing there actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">And a thought went through our minds, and maybe this a group of peoples going to go for final resolutions of their problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">Probably <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or so, and then after two or three nights staying on straw mats on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , you lying down one night, you woke up the next night about three feet away because the straw mats were moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">That's how people were talking about, lice, horrible situation there, and they one morning they decided to let us out the of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and direct us toward the <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> where open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">While to me this was nothing new. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">I read it very well and I knew what's happening now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">First thought was, we probably going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or one of those <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">But the young people think maybe this get to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">But the old people, sick people, people on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretchers</span> and so on that's what they do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">They seal the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , but through the upper little <span class="DLF">windows</span> they actually wired type of upper portion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> were wired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">You could see through and standing on somebody's shoulders you could see <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">I seen there were only two guards, soldiers or what ever, Gestapo I'm not sure who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">One near the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> , the beginning of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and one at the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">This was not really clear to me what the purpose of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">Where are we going? </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">Nobody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">Everybody was asking the same question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">People were squashed like cattle, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">About maybe close to 100 people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">Woman, man, there were no toilet facilities of course, and people just relieving themselves the way they were, standing and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">And everybody, you know, without any concentration. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">The fear, you know, not knowing where we going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">I was conditioned to it a little bit, and the other Poles weren't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">The rest the Poles weren't, so that's the first experience they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">So I was kind of over hand but the final <span class="NPIP">destination</span> was still the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">So what am I going to win here? </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">We going to go together as a Pole maybe, but still. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">All of a sudden one night one very important <span class="BUILDING">railroad stations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">The <span class="NPIP">place</span> was bombed by allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">They destroyed the railroad lengths you know, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> couldn't go any further. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">This detained us for about two or three days until they repaired the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">And to say there were no food given, no water given, there were no people <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">There was nothing and then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> start rolling again and after unknown number of days, we are arrived in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">The name was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jedrzejow</span> a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with maybe 8, 10,000 people and all of a sudden the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">The <span

this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> going left, this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> going straight, the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> going to the right and we found ourselves in front of many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">horse carriages</span> , you know, driven by the local peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">And in front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> and Polish woman was sitting there registering everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">They want your IDs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">So you give IDs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">I was in railroad uniform at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">My wife was with me and registered, and she assigned us to a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , to a peasant that was forced to take us as guests and to feed us and be responsible for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">And they let us go free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">We didn't go in any <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">We didn't go to any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">No one ever informed us what going to happen, nothing until this moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">We're driven, by, it turn out later, by the mayor of this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to a different farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">He brought us there, knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">Here they are and he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">Of course, we speak very fluent and clean, very intelligent Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">Peasant Polish 1s a little different Polish and they hate the city people you know, and he told me right away in slang, "I am not taking freeloaders to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">I cannot afford you people." </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">I said "I was wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">Lucine was wounded too, my wife, you know." </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">She was bandaged up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">I said, but "look, as soon as we feel better we going to help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">We help you on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">He said, "I'm not going to take no body." </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">And, he shut the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">We standing there maybe, most of the day <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">It was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">Mind you this was already either end of October or so, beginning of November, it was cold, raining. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">We hugged each other, standing, didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">He refused to take us in and we stayed like this way all night under the little <span class="DLF">roof</span> , thinking what next. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">Early in the morning, the mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> appeared there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">Allegedly, he knew that we were not taken in by this farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">He asked us to go with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">We didn't have no luggage with us, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">So we walked with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">He took us to the only <span class="BUILDING">building</span> made out of brick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">The rest were <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> and he say, you stay in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> now, and the people walked out, the farmer, middle age people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">Maybe she was 40, 42, he was maybe 45, with two little kids and very friendly invited us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">Knowing that we were wounded so they give us their own <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> so we can sleep and rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">She said she making chicken for me, chicken broth and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">Very, very friendly and accepting us, and feeling sorry for us probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">Well, at this moment I didn't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">I just wanted to lie down and rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">I didn't feel good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">I was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">I was weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">I was bleeding a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">All the turmoil and what was happening next and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">I didn't look beyond that moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">The same night I woke up with a light flashing in my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">Who are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">I thought maybe Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">Right away you know you always live with that fear it's always in your end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">And here was a man said, I am from the underground from Home Army in this <span class="REGION">area</span> , we heard that you people were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , uprising from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and we just want to tell you we very apologetic we couldn't come to your help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">You know, those days you couldn't take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> to help the other groups of the Home Army you know but he said they couldn't do nothing for us and so on but they make sure not a hair on our head here in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">As a matter of fact, they hear about the other <span class="DLF">farm</span> and they took care of him already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">They went that night before they came to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">They woke up the whole family, the farmer refuse our entry asked him to strip completely from the waist down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">Bent over a trunk of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> and so on they beat him up with some ... branches of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">They were bleeding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">They beat up the whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">The farmer, his wife, his grown-up sons and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">The farmer beg us to return to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">We didn't have nothing to do with them beating them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">But they aware that we're from Warsaw uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">They thought that we really some important people from the Home Army, which we're not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">I was a small fish there, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">But, anyway I was proud to be one of them and he said they make sure that if we need a doctor they provide medical me care and so on and nothing would happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">And believe me our care was the best care any <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> could give us and after I got a little better, I got worse again and I got sick with high fever and yellow jaundice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">My nights were horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">I didn't know what I was talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">Lucine said I was talking nonsense through my sleep and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">They were scared I might die, temperature 103, 104, yellow jaundice, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">Finally, the farmer said I take you to the doctor, I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">Can't let you dies like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">So he took his two horses, you know, and his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , you know, and took me to nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">There was Polish doctor there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">This <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was about 15 or 20 kilometers away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">In the meantime, Lucine was very, she recovered faster than I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">and she was very helpful in the <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">She was helping with chickens and cooking and peeling potatoes and bringing in water and whatever was necessary and feeding the pigs, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">And they liked it very much because they, we didn't have to be paid for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">You know, they just supported us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">And they were very grateful for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">It showed the way they treated us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">And I was just a victim of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">I was in no shape to do any of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">And I went to this doctor, was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">I remember like today they had to practically carry me upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">I couldn't walk straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">There was a little <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">There was no one in the <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span> , but I had to wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">To my left was a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">On the little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> was a little box, looked like from medical instrument something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">I glance at the box. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">There was a label on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">Dr. Grayefski (ph) <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Praga</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">Just I notice this that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">I was still in my uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">That's the only clothes I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">Finally the <span class="DLF">door</span> opens up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">The nurse calls me in, said Mr. Woyick? </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">I said, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">And she asked me my history, what happened to me and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">So I told her the whole story about Warsaw uprising, my wounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">my wife being hurt and so on, I thought maybe a results of this result of my wounds, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">06:12: So they wrote everything down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">The doctor comes in and he said what's your name? </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">And I said Wojick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">He looks at my uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">Where you from? </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">I said, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">Are you a railroad man? </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">I said, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">Which division, department? </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">I said, we're <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">You must know me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">I was your doctor of the railroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">So I look at him, look at him, look at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">I said, "you're not by any chance Dr. Grayefski?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">He said, of course I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">You know me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">This name I memorize from this little box on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">And from then on was such a bond, such a contact, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">I didn't worry about any suspicions or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">He gave me a shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">I turned back, he gave me a shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">He didn't know who was, nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">Gave me some vitamins, some medications and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">I went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and from then on I started my miraculous recovery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">The people were nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">There were some other Warsaw refugees there, Polish refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">One was a shoemaker and I felt very uneasy about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">For some reason he look at me all the time and I was worrying if he maybe recognize me from somewhere or suspect who I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">And during Easter holidays he invited us, me and Lucine to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">He was all alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">I think he was single, but he was middle age person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">And we would talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">He ask me questions, where I from and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">Very inquisitive you know, which <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I went to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">So I told him, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">I told him the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">I told him all these things which was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">My Polish misled everybody because my Polish was the best, if I brag about it, one thing, I brag my language. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">I speak several languages my Polish is exquisite. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">Is perfect, really perfect, literately Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">They couldn't understand it because Jews don't speak that kind of Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">None of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">So, but he never said nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">He was very cordial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">Treated us, Polish sausage and this and then apologize he not a good cook, but he done what he could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">By being fellow from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and so on we have something in common, he thought he invite us be the holidays with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">He didn't want to be alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">And slowly I was recovering. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">Then I got the idea how could I repay those peasants, for they're their ... being so good to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">And I thought since the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were illegal and <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> closed I would organize a secret <span class="BUILDING">Polish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">And I suspected that mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was somebody that maybe I don't know exactly who he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">He was more than just the mayor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">And one day I approached him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">I said, you know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">I feel strong enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">I like to teach the children Polish language to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">Little math, geography, whatever I can, and the political situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">Let them be aware of what was going on now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">But I have no books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">How we going to get books? </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">The <span class="REGION">area</span> we located was far away from our normal <span class="REGION">area</span> where we used to live you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">I didn't know anyone there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">o he said, "well, I'll tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">I'll give you a name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">You can go to next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">As a matter of fact, on Sunday I go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">Maybe I take you with me, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , and then I don't know want to go with you, to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to that person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">Just tell them I send you and you tell them what you need. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">But I said I don't have money either -- "don't worry about that, just don't worry about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">Just tell him what need." </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">I will straighten it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">And I met this person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">He looked at me suspicious look, asked for my IDs, my documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">Asked I was from Home Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">I said, yes, I was wounded during the uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">So he had no reason to doubt me, which was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">I didn't say who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">He gave me about ten difference books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">Polish readings, simple arithmetics, art, crayons, all the pencils, all the little things, erasers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">Here I am, educational director. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">I'm organizing a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">I took the kids together in one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">I told them what we going to do and I told them we have to be smart about it because if the German find out that we have a secret <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they are going to burn the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and we have to have a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">So we taught the kids that each day, one of the kids, they were mostly boys if I remember, will stand guard <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on the top, on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">Our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was top of the <span class="DLF">hill</span> so you can see the <span class="DLF">road</span> down there in the

</span><span class="sentence" id="1736">So there was a kind of a chaos on the <span class="DLF">border</span> but it was not used up as a chaotic type of political purpose or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">Everybody knew this was a purpose of family reunions, and we one day in this group everybody was saying remarks, you know, that we shouldn't stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1738">We shouldn't stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1739">So we thought maybe we should leave <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and go someplace outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1740"><span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> maybe, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , we didn't know yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1741">So this was in the talkative stages and in the meantime, my uncle didn't show too much a ties to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1742">And he was doing his things, busy dating and doing other things you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1743">And in meantime, he was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1744">He was the commanding officer of the <span class="BUILDING">Polish Pilot school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1745">Instructor and commanding officer there for stealing a blanket or something, selling on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1746">That was what he was accused of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1747">Could be they wanted to get rid of him too because he was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1748">They knew he was Jewish see, and was he thrown out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1749">I never found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1750">I know he went to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , maybe two years in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1751">In the meantime, I was without any money and so on, so I decided to sell my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1752">It was a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1753">But I didn't have nothing to live on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1754">No suits, no dress for my wife, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1755">So I approached somebody who was an attorney. </span><span class="sentence" id="1756">If you have any customer for the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and said, yes, and found a butcher, Polish butcher want to buy my <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1757">I said, why you pay the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1758">Everything is nationalized by the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1759">You cannot own it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1760">They said I know, but I made so much money during the Germans times, illegally slaughtering cattle and so on, I had all this cash lying around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1761">I won't benefit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1762">Maybe someday my kids will benefit from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1763">They'll have the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="1764">I said, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1765">I sold it for $1,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="1766">The attorney took $400 so I was left with $400 American dollar which was a fortune. </span><span class="sentence" id="1767">I buy a new suit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1768">The only picture I have right now is in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> is with Lucine when we both were dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1769">She bought a new hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1770">I bought a suit and shoes and we are in the <span class="DLF">park</span> , and our kids look at the picture, Dad, you don't look like you just survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1771">You look like you came from a <span class="BUILDING">country club</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1772">I was shaven, lean, smiling, pale maybe, but smiling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1773">I said, look, we're young. </span><span class="sentence" id="1774">We cannot bring back what we lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1775">We can live with the past, we can live with our memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1776">We can start from scratch and build our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again from the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1777">So that's what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1778">I bought her a delayed wedding present. </span><span class="sentence" id="1779">I bought her a ring, small ring and a watch, gold watch with the money and one day the whole group, with the help of Bricha. </span><span class="sentence" id="1780">I don't know if you know who Bricha is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1781">Bricha is the Palestinian underground agency which is helping the Jews escape from Soviet Russia coming to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1782">They were smuggling those people, those young people to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1783">With their assistance we crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> one cold night in November, 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="1784">The only thing I took we me is my student papers, my books and so on in case I ever go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and to save my papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1785">And on their advice they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1786">We met a lot of Jewish students already, Americans, first time I seen Americans, life full of music and laughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1787">I didn't know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1788">I didn't know how to behave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1789">I was afraid of this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1790">I thought it was sacrilegious; to laugh and to smile and go to <span class="BUILDING">night clubs</span> , <span class="BUILDING">coffee houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1791">I couldn't cope with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1792">I wasn't ready for it you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1793">But we stayed together the whole group for about 2 year and one when his own way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1794">They graduated -- one architecture, one electrical engineer, few medical students. </span><span class="sentence" id="1795">One boy couldn't cope with the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1796">Went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , Jewish boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1797">Didn't know what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1798">And, then each one went his own way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1799">With the help of the American Joint Committee we getting a stipend to pay for our tuition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1800">To my amazement when they accepted me to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> they accept all the papers translated by the Jewish Committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> found out I need my high school diploma which I didn't have with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1801">I didn't know what happened to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1802">But my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> still stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1803">I wrote to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1804">They sent me a copy of my high school diploma. </span><span class="sentence" id="1805">For whatever strange reason, I had 6 years of Latin and a degree of Latin was a dash, like I never had Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1806">The professor looks at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1807">I'm sorry everything is in order but you have no Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1808">You have to take a pre-entrance exam in Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1809">I said you know if after all these years I don't know if I remember too many things and my German was very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1810">I just started learning German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1811">What language do you speak? </span><span class="sentence" id="1812">Polish, Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1813">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1814">You speak Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1815">I speak Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1816">So he give me two days to come back and take an exam in Latin in the Russian language which I did and I passed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1817">He said, I want to know if you ever took Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1818">It is not exam for grading. </span><span class="sentence" id="1819">I want to know if you were acquainted with Latin, if you remember something and so on, which I did many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1820">And he was satisfied. </span><span class="sentence" id="1821">He gave me a passing grade and here I was back in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1822">So, we struggled quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1823">It was very difficult financially, but the Zionist Organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , helped us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1824">They rent a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for the whole group of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1825">And we lived in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1826">They fed us, warm, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1827">They gave us blankets, gave us suits, you know, from American Joint. </span><span class="sentence" id="1828">We felt like human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1829">We did regain our dignity, slowly, and one day somebody came to us and said, you know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1830">I just came back from the <span class="REGION">British Zone</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1831">Run into somebody who 1s a relative of yours. </span><span class="sentence" id="1832">So I said, what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1833">What's his name? </span><span class="sentence" id="1834">So, he mentioned first name Baruch, Baruch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1835">I don't have anybody in my family named Baruch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1836">Then Lucine remembered, you know what, that my cousin, who was our only witness on our wedding in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1837">He must be him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1838">Well that’s the address. </span><span class="sentence" id="1839">We wrote a letter to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1840">He wrote back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1841">It was him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1842">He survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1843">He made contact with an aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1844">It was his real aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1845">It was my wife's second line aunt actually because the aunt with the baby in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> that went to the <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Polski</span> was her sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1846">But we wrote a letter to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1847">We didn't ask for anything, but they start showering us with gifts, packages, food, chocolates, cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1848">I didn't smoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="1849">I was selling on <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1850">He, her uncle asked me if I needed anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1851">He can send me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1852">He said, "do you want papers?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1853">I try to get you papers to come to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1854">But first you have to graduate and get your diploma. </span><span class="sentence" id="1855">Don't you ever come to the States without diploma. </span><span class="sentence" id="1856">You'd be nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1857">If you be medical doctor then you be somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1858">Your future be assured. </span><span class="sentence" id="1859">As difficult it might be for now, I remind you of a family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , mind you, people I never met, I never knew, Lucine never met, never knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1860">She knew of this them but was a distant family through marriage of her uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1861">He start sending me packages of certain things, medication. </span><span class="sentence" id="1862">I sell on black market. </span><span class="sentence" id="1863">And we live like kings then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1864">So after <span class="BUILDING">graduate medical school</span> , we throw a party for maybe 50 people, our friends and so on like one family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1865">We became one 93 family all the refugee, students and their relatives were all one family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1866">They substitute for our lost brothers and sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1867">Their parents were our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1868">We used to call them mom and dad, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1869">Some of them fortunately survived, some parents of my colleagues. </span><span class="sentence" id="1870">They were very good to us and it helped us to regain our composure you know and maybe regain faith in humanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1871">And slowly we registered in <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> , and here we met a little difficulty with one lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="1872">This was the time of Korean War. </span><span class="sentence" id="1873">We registered with all the proper documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1874">We got a visa to enter <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1875">The only thing still, I didn't finish my final exam to get my diploma. </span><span class="sentence" id="1876">She said, you have a deadline to meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1877">You have to go right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1878">You have three weeks time to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1879">What am I going to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1880">I cannot get my diploma in three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1881">My final exam is not until a few months from now on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1882">She was very annoyed with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1883">She said "I have my son fighting <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> and you have a chance to go to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and you refuse to." </span><span class="sentence" id="1884">I said, "look, I'm not refusing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1885">And I try to explain to her where I stand, what's the problem." </span><span class="sentence" id="1886">She was not very compassionate, couldn't understand, and said, well, if that's how it is, then you might lose your entry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1887">I said, well, if that's what's going to be, that's what's going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1888">If I go there now I be nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1889">I only ask you to allow to finish my studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1890">It's only a few months, can you ask for an extension? </span><span class="sentence" id="1891">No, I can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1892">So we walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1893">This was the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1894">We are very depressed, upset and depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1895">We worn out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1896">I didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1897">I knew we could not stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> because foreigners were not allowed to stay and practice in profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="1898">You could only study. </span><span class="sentence" id="1899">And the one day we get a note, a letter from the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> to report to the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1900">It was a different person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1901">It was a man, A different lady and they are telling us that we got our visa extended and when do we think we can go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1902">Is our time to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1903">When can we go? </span><span class="sentence" id="1904">We can go any time now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1905">I just graduate and got my diploma. </span><span class="sentence" id="1906">So, I don't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1907">Either this first lady had second thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1908">Maybe she was bitter that her son was in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1909">I felt very bad for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1910">I was very sad but, maybe she did understand my problem and quietly maybe she helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1911">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1912">I never seen her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1913">I wish I would. </span><span class="sentence" id="1914">And we packed and went to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1915">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1916">We are greeted by my wife's family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1917">They treated us very nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1918">They were very well-to-do people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1919">And they were very instrumental in our well being and he asked me, what can I do for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1920">You need money, tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1921">I said, look, I’m young, I have ten fingers, I have both hands, thank God I am not lame. </span><span class="sentence" id="1922">I want to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1923">I do the right thing to do, only I need advice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1924">And we survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1925">We survived so far. </span><span class="sentence" id="1926">I didn't want nothing from them and I know he told me, you know, Felix, you're the only relative -- we brought quite a few from Europe -- you're the only one that never asked for money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1927">I said, you know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1928">It is a very strange thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1929">I learned from the past several years to do without money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1930">I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1931">If you have less, you do less. </span><span class="sentence" id="1932">You did what you could without money and this is not the most important thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1933">We have goal ahead of us, a purpose in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1934">I want to start as soon as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1935">We want to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1936">It was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">jungle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1937">Too many refugee and I wanted to mingle with American people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1938">I didn't know any English, I want to start learning and I want to get on my foot all by myself without any assistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1939">So went to the Jewish Committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1940">Where should we go? </span><span class="sentence" id="1941">We opened a map and the social worker put her finger on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1942">And she said "that's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1943">What about that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1944">That's fine wherever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1945">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1946"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cultural town</span> with a decent <span class="BUILDING">school of music</span> , beautiful <span class="BUILDING">medical schools</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1947">Got acquainted with proper people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1948">We got refuge from a German Jewish family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1949">We stayed with them for several months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1950">They were beautiful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1951">Very nice to us and right away I got acquainted with the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1952">The chief of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was a Jewish fellow, Dr. Stapens (ph) who was fascinated with my stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1953">He wanted to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1954">He supposed to ask me medical questions, if I equipped to start, what my internship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1955">Mind you, not speaking English was very difficult to establish that fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1956">He spoke some German, very little, but one the chief surgeons was fluent in German so he called him in, and the three of us sitting in his <span class="INT_SPACE">chambers</span> in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> and talking German and what he was asking my whole story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1957">QUESTION:  Tell me about going back and going back to the woman with the candelabra?</span></p>
