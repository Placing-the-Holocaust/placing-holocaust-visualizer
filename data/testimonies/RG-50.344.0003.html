<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Okay... Okay, this is July 14th, 1995, we’re in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Park</span> , New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">This is Nina Ellis interviewing Elizabeth A. Feldhusen. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Tell me please, when -- when were you born and where were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  Well, I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , April 21st, 1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  And where were you living when you decided to become a nurse?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Oh, I was still living in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , on <span class="DLF">MacDonough Street</span> , between <span class="DLF">Louis Avenue</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuyvesant</span> , which was a very nice <span class="REGION">area</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And my family lived there about 10 years and then we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Park Slope</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  And why did you decide you wanted to be a nurse? </span><span class="sentence" id="16">How did you decide that? </span><span class="sentence" id="17">July 14, 1995
ANSWER:  Well, things happen in my life in peculiar ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I had been a Girl Scout and when I was 12 -- I still remember that, we were given a course on <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- I think the Red Cross gave it -- home nursing and care of the sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And I just looked at that book and read it once and the whole thing was memorized. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">But my mother was always against it, so when I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , I looked for a job, it was in the middle of the Depression and --
QUESTION:  What year did you graduate from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  In 1936, in June of *36 and I looked for a job and I finally found something in a <span class="BUILDING">hair net factory</span> and I worked one week and I wouldn’t go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">My mother went back for my seven dollars check or cash -- they paid in cash in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And then the same agency that had gotten me that job, said she would -- I was a Roman Catholic and they kept asking me if I would change my religion, believe it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So by then -- that was around, I think September, or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So I finally said, “All right, I'll change it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So she said, “Just fill out the card and put Protestant down.” </span><span class="sentence" id="27">You know, make out the card the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And she sent me over to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> with a -- oh, there must have been about 10 or 12 of us and they gave us little tests. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And the one test I remember was a row of numbers and they said, just put a circle around, say the seventh. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Just go down the whole column and -- and then we had some other things that were similar and then they disappeared and then they came out again and they said, “Well, Miss So and So and Miss So and So and Miss Feldhusen will please remain and the others may go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="31">So I was hired. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And I worked there until -- I think it was from November, maybe October, until the first of February. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And then I went July 14, 1995 into nurses training. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">But the way the nurses training came about was that my father tuned <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pianos</span> --
QUESTION:  Before you tell me this, I want to -- hang on one second.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  One of his jobs was at <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn State Hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">In those days they had big state hospitals.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  So, my father talked to the -- well, when he went to <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn State</span> , he always went in to see the superintendent and -- and then they would let him know where he was to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So he knew the superintendent quite well, so he told him about his daughter, who was having trouble finding a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">But eventually, you know, I was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Just doing file clerk work. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And so the superintendent says, “Well, we have a <span class="BUILDING">nurses training school</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Why don’t you have your daughter come and enter our class?” </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And that was around October, November. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So my father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and told me that and I said, “Well, I’m sure the classes started in September and I would be two months later and I’d never be able to catch up.” </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So he -- so my father says, “Well, I pass by King’s County Hospital when I go to Brooklyn State,” cause he went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And so I wrote to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">King’s County</span> and applied and they sent me all the applications and whatnot. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Now, they took classes twice a year and their next class was the first of February. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So I was accepted and -- and then where I was working -- I worked right up until the last day and left and went into nurses training.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">July 14, 1995
ANSWER:  And just by happenstance, I really picked one of the best <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">In it’s day, it was very, very fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And I had a friend that went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bellevue</span> and there was just no comparison. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">We were treated like young ladies and we were expected to be young ladies. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bellevue</span> it was helter-skelter, come as you go and just -- really, you had to be tough to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So I -- it worked out very well for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  And when did you finish your training?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Well, that was a three year training course. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I mean, they practically don’t have those any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But when I graduated -- I had always wanted to go into public health. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We had two months of public health experience as part of our nurses training and I liked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And so I went to the Brooklyn Visiting Nurse Association and applied for a position. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And she said, “You have to have one term of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So then I went to <span class="BUILDING">New York University</span> and wen -- went to <span class="BUILDING">night school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And I finally got my 16 college points and -- and I worked for them almost a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">But then people were going into the army and I had patients -- my sickest patients would say to me, “What are you taking care of me for? </span><span class="sentence" id="67">You should be taking care of the boys.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  I had that time and time again. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So I have a very close friend, and she also wanted to gO, SO We went in together, and --
QUESTION:  When was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  That was very vivid in my mind, the first of July, 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I still remember that first day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  What was it like? </span><span class="sentence" id="74">What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="75">July 14, 1995
ANSWER:  Oh, it was a day like this, hot as anything and her brother took us to the -- to get the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to go down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilmington</span> , <span class="REGION">Delaware</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And we were given very little instruction as to what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We got down to <span class="REGION">Delaware</span> -- down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilmington</span> and I think some -- it’s- there were very brief letter and it said, “You go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilmington</span> and you take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army bus</span> to <span class="BUILDING">fort</span> -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dupont</span> Delaware.” </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And we couldn’t find the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And there was no air conditioning in those days and we were rushing around from here to there and we were there almost all day. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And we were so hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I was exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And we went to the <span class="BUILDING">travelers agency</span> that is supposed to help travelers. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">They didn’t know a thing about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dupont</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And they were there really to help people in the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Didn’t know anything about their bus service. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Well finally, as I recall, somebody overheard us. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Must have been a soldier and he said, oh yes, there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> around six o’clock at night, something like that and he told us where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So we ended up at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dupont</span> , we didn’t have any supper and we were just exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And -- and the chief nurse just act as if we were arriving at eight o’clock in the morning and I thought she was going to put us on duty right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But she finally let us go and showed us our <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and -- and that led -- that was my first day of army experience and it was really, really -- it wasn’t very pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Now I was just looking at Phyllis’s photographs. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Now she was in big <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> like <span class="BUILDING">Tilton General</span> and <span class="BUILDING">England General</span> and -- and I was very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We only had seven nurses and four doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Very small <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  There at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dupont</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  At <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dupont</span> , <span class="REGION">Delaware</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">July 14, 1995
QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  How long were you there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  I was there I think about a year and a half and then my friend and I were picked to go overseas and we joined this 131st <span class="BUILDING">evacuation hospital</span> and --
QUESTION:  Where did you join them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Well, I tried to think. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I’m not really -- we went -- I really don’t remember, really, how we formed, or whether we had to report. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Someplace down in <span class="REGION">South Carolina</span> , that’s where we left from. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">But it’s really very vague in my mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  Were you on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> then -- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Queen Elizabeth</span> , crossing with [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">We were all together, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And I re -- we were -- there were 40 of us and half were in one <span class="INT_SPACE">state room</span> and half in another <span class="INT_SPACE">state room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> up to the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And I had a bottom <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> and I really had to lie on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> in order to get into that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And then all night long, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> would go this way and that way, so you’re either on your feet or on your head. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But the reason was -- I don’t know if the other girls told you, but that we turned every seven minutes in order to avoid the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> , because we did not have any escort across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">So --
QUESTION:  Were you -- were you nervous?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  I don’t remember that I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">You know, when you’re young and it was like a -- an adventure, you know, and all these activities and whatnot you had never been exposed to July 14, 1995 before. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But we were very crowded, that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">It was very hard to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sit down anywheres, you know, they -- we had about 10,000 troops on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Wow. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And 40 nurses.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  Yeah, well, the nurses, we didn’t do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">You know, we were just in a group, we weren’t performing any nursing --
QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  Excuse me, any nursing functions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Were you the only women on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  Yeah, as I remember we were the only women.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  40 women out of 10,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Well, I'll tell you, men were more respectful in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">In fact, I remember when I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dupont</span> and two of the men -- two of the corpsmen were out in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> and one of them used a -- a foul word --
QUESTION:  Watch your microphone, now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  -- and he immediately came in and apologized. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">You see, and that wouldn’t exist today, because the girls themselves use f -- terrible language. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I hear it when I go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , right in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , so I think women have really damaged themselves by trying to become- meet the level of everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So --
QUESTION:  Well, tell me what it was like in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">What did you do in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Well, of course we landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenock</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> and we had to climb over the side and get down into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trawler</span> , because the Queen could only go in so far. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And then -- and July 14, 1995 we tramped, we had these heavy boots on and fatigues and we tramped to a <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and I can still remember that, the noise, you know, as we walked 1n the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And everybody of course, I think everybody was probably nervous because we didn’t know what was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And we came to a <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> -- and this is about two or three o’clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And we rode for awhile and then we got off and then we tramped some more and then they said, “The girls will have this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and then the men will be here and the other men will be there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And as we went down the <span class="DLF">street</span> , everybody got a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live and you went in and -- and there was a pile of blankets in the <span class="INT_SPACE">front hall</span> and you grabbed a blanket and you just laid on it and mine was so greasy. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I was awake all night, I couldn’t sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And that was the beginning of our adventure there. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And -- see, we were supposed to go right into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and then changes were made. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Something happened to the American troops and so everything was changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So then we didn’t do much of anything and finally we were assigned to local units. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And I know I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Wales</span> and worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">But I really don’t know how long I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Couple of weeks?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  You were care -- you were there caring for [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Yeah, we -- they were running ha -- actually American-run <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And the one in <span class="COUNTRY">Wales</span> , the nurses lived in -- in these <span class="BUILDING">Neesan huts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And when you wanted to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> , you had to run out and well, quite a distance to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> or to take your <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And -- so you didn’t take a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> too often, but I know the nights when I got off duty, I had everything all ready and I just grabbed everything and then ran up to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , July 14, 1995 because if you didn’t get there first, somebody else did and you didn’t get any more hot water. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So, I mean, even if you took a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> twice a week, at least you -- you got a good one when you -- if you got there first. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So, I was there probably a couple weeks and I was o -- on a <span class="INT_SPACE">psychiatric ward</span> , which, I never cared for that service, but anyhow -- and then eventually we were all recalled and then we went over into Europe proper.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  All of you 40 together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  Yes, all of us, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Except one nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">She was married and before we went overseas, we had time off and she met her husband in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We were all wondering what’s happened to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">You know, we lost sight of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And she got pregnant in that short period. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So by the time we got to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , she knew she was pregnant and they sent her right <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So we had 39. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And we never -- and they told us, if anything happened, we would never -- nobody would be replaced. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So we functioned just with the 39 then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  So you crossed the English channel and --
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  -- went to a --
ANSWER:  Yeah, we did that in the middle of the night also. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And they dropped these big gasoline- | don’t know what they call them, they’re about as big as gasoline cans. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And that went on all night --
QUESTION:  Depth charges.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  -- you just heard boom, boom, boom, because of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">So, and then we landed in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Gee, I’ve forgotten the name of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Le Havre -- July 14, 1995
QUESTION:  Le Havre.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Havre</span> is where we -- and I’d never -- course I’d never been to Europe before and I wanted to see everything I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And then they loaded us -- loaded us into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  Do you remember what month this would have been?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  Um, we were not allowed to keep diaries and I had everything with me and we were told we must get rid of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And that’s my -- and a lot of people -- not my -- I don’t know about my unit, but other people did keep diaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I mean men. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And -- so the dates are very vague to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And I don’t know if --
QUESTION:  Was it warm, was it summer’? </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Do you remember?</span></p>

ANSWER:  I’ve always been wanting to get my unit’s -- you know, they ha -- the -- each unit had to write up their experience and I’ve always been wanting to get a copy of that, because I don’t know about the dates.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">QUESTION:  Well, when did he tell you this? </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Before you got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  Oh no, when we arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">He then said he wanted the nurses lined up. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">You know, you lined up for everything and -- and we stood and -- and that was when he told us that -- that we did not have to go if we didn’t want to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  Did he tell you what you would see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">All I remember is that he said, “There’s a great deal of tuberculosis here,” which is quite infectious, and -- and whatever else he told us, that’s about all I remember of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And maybe he told us we’d see a lot of things that -- that we -- you know, that would be very hard to accept, but I’m very vague on that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  Had you heard anything about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="273">July 14, 1995
ANSWER:  No, no I never had, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And now see, some of the girls knew a lot of the officers, you know, and they may have learned things that way, but I never knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I never had anything to do with them, I never bothered. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And, well, like that one girl, they were keeping company, so I’m sure he must have talked to her about things. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Now, what he heard, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And so, that’s --
QUESTION:  Well, the next day then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">ANSWER:  Yeah, the next day, we went on duty right away, the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And that was when he told us that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  Yes, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">QUESTION:  And what was your responsibility?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">ANSWER:  Well, I had a <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> , big <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> and there was a great deal of diarrhea and we were giving out sulfanilamide, which is -- I don’t think it’s a drug used any more, but it’s before the antibiotics came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And, oh we gave out like 20 pills and everybody was up in tiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">In order to get up to the top person, you had to stand on the lower tiers to reach them. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So --
QUESTION:  Was this a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that they were in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  It was like a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  It wasn’t a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="290">July 14, 1995
ANSWER:  Well, we ca -- I think our <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> called it the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , because all these were the sickest people. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And they were in -- lying in these tiers, these one, two, well at least three - three up. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">So --
QUESTION:  Were those the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that they had been living in previously?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">ANSWER:  That I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">That I don’t know.</span></p>

QUESTION:  You cared for them every day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  -- yes, mm-hm, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And eventually we got these young German prisoners of war to help us as ward men. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">You know, to carry bedpans and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">urinals</span> and -- and help, and we had very little to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">We didn’t have much food and they -- our group went around thinking they could get food from the <span class="BUILDING">German warehouses</span> and they found they were empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Everything had been used up, you know, because it was the end, and everybody was -- I guess the Germans were fleeing and -- and had used up what they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And that was really -- I guess they ran out of -- must have ran out of supplies and whatnot. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">So
QUESTION:  And what was the condition of the people when you first saw them? </span><span class="sentence" id="304">They were all -- were they all men that you were caring for?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">They were all men where I was, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">QUESTION:  And the first day you saw them, what -- what was their condition? </span><span class="sentence" id="308">What -- what were they -- July 14, 1995
ANSWER:  Well, they were lying in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and they were weak and very thin. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And I guess it was shocking, you know, when you’re not used to seeing all those types of things and people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">QUESTION:  Were they clothed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">ANSWER:  Yeah, they had shirts on of some kind, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And -- and pajamas, seems to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">QUESTION:  The striped? </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Did they have on the striped --
ANSWER:  No, I don’t remember that, it just seems to me they had -- they had plain pajamas on. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I don’t really remember exactly what they had on, but they -- they were covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">QUESTION:  Were they able to speak to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">ANSWER:  Well, they didn’t speak English, but I can get by with a little German and so that was - but I mean there really wasn’t too much to say either, you know, when you’re coming with the pills and they’re objecting and you’re saying, Si moosta dus taking, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Me with my German and English. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">So they -- they got the picture and -- and then they’d swallow them and so --
QUESTION:  Were you bathing them or --
ANSWER:  No, we didn’t do anything like that, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">QUESTION:  Did other people do that for them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Really, it just took you all day giving out the medication. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">So -- and whether --
QUESTION:  Why did that take so long? </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Why did it take --
ANSWER:  Well, because we had so many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Oh, I had a big <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I don’t know, I had <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> with all these people on t -- in tiers, you know, three or four tiers going July 14, 1995 up. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">In one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> you had, boy, three, four, eight, 12 -- sic -- I bet you had about at least 20 people in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">You know, all these like three and three. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">It’s sort of vague to me, though.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">QUESTION:  And they -- did you feed them, were they -- did you have food for them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">ANSWER:  Well, we had food. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And that’s another thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I don’t quite recall how we did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">We would have to have had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trays</span> , unless we had -- maybe there were tin dishes and we gave them the dishes, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">That, again, is vague to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I -- just how we did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I don’t remember any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">QUESTION:  What kinds of precautions were you able to take to protect yourself from --
ANSWER:  We really didn’t take any.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  Nothing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">ANSWER:  No, we had fatigues on and that was all. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">We didn’t wear gowns or anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  Other people have mentioned DDT spray.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">ANSWER:  Oh, that’s another thing, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Before we went on duty, we had a gun that was about that long and they’d fill it with DDT and then it had a plunger and you held your thing out -- your suit open like this and somebody would plunge it and plunge it down the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And then your hair was all done -- we wore helmets.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">QUESTION:  It was powder, DDT powder’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  It was powder, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And -- and I don’t know, I had cancer of the breast and nobody ever asked me if I was exposed to DDT. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And I often wonder if it had anything to do with July 14, 1995 that. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">But then, there are an awful lot of women that have had the same thing that I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">So -- but we certainly was full of DTT.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">QUESTION:  Every day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  Every day we did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Tons of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Nobody realized how dangerous it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">QUESTION:  You were probably grateful to have it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Yeah, because they said there might be lice, you know and whatnot and so -- but I never caught anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">QUESTION:  Did anybody”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">ANSWER:  I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I was very sick when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , but that’s before I ever had any contact with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">So, I think we were all quite healthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">QUESTION:  In the evenings, when you weren’t on duty, what -- what did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">ANSWER:  Well, all we had were these <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> to sit in. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">We went on walks. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Oh, that was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , when I went on that walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I don’t -- oh, I know, when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in one <span class="REGION">area</span> , a whole group of us, including the men, decided to go on a walk and we did walk up on a <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And there was a -- you could hear the cuckoo. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">You know, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the cuckoos sound like the cuckoo clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Cuckoo, cuckoo. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And I -- I was a birdwatcher and I says, “Oh, I’m dying to see that cuckoo.” </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So the whole group of us went up and climbed up that <span class="DLF">hill</span> and we were walking around and looking and we could hear it -- cuckoo -- coming from different -- and all of a sudden, bullets started firing. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">See, it was a come on. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And we got down from there very, very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And there was no mistaking who we were, because we had big Red Crosses on all our <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Our <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> were July 14, 1995 all down at the base. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">But you could hear the wi -- the bullets flying right overhead. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">You could hear them whistling. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Never saw anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">So --

<p><span class="sentence" id="397">ANSWER:  Well, we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> -- well, while we were still -- no, that was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , when the war was over and Hitler killed himself and my friend Grace brought this radio with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I think she was ready to throw it away many a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And -- July 14, 1995 you could never really get anything on it, cause we had so little ele-electricity, but she had it connected that night and we could hear the funeral music. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And we said something has happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">But we found out later, you know, that Hitler had killed himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And that was all -- you know, everything was garbled, you couldn’t get anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">We hardly had a light to see by. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">You know, one light and just enough electricity so you could find your way around, cause we had our own generators and they were very limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">But when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gusen</span> -- did somebody tell you about that terrible accident when we were crossing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="406">We were talking about it earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">We were -- every once in awhile you know, like the infantry or the armored group would find out that there were nurses in the <span class="REGION">area</span> and then we would be invited over for a social evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And we’d all went in a big group and we all came back together. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And we were going to cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> and that’s a very fast flowing <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And -- and there were signs there. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">I’d been across it a couple of times and signs that said to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeeps</span> , “Do not start up your engines until the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> has docked.” </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And it was just a flat board, you know, boards. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And we went over on a wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And the wire hel -- was connected to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and that would guide it over, and then it would come back again. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Otherwise the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> wa -- 1t wasn’t really a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">raft</span> -- would be swept down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">So we arrived this evening, we were -- quite a group of us, and -- for a social evening, some group across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And the soldier that was there on duty was in a terrible state. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And he said, “The most awful thing has happened,” he said, “so there’ll be a little delay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="419">He said one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeeps</span> started up their engine and a nun had come along with her horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> and the horse bolted. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">It frightened him July 14, 1995 so, that he just ran and of course there was nothing to stop him. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Ended up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and she and the horse drowned. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Now we were talking about that earlier today and they said they thought that the nun had some children in the -- orphans or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I says, “I don’t ever remember hearing that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="424">But I know then -- and they finally found her and the horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">The horse, they let him just go, he was already gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">But she was drowned. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> is So -- was So swift there. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">So little things like that happened, you know and tragedy. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Didn’t have to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  So. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">But it was the way they -- because all the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> had been blown up, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">In fact, when we crossed the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , one of the -- the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> , we came down a <span class="DLF">hill</span> and we were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , ca -- and we went across on <span class="DLF">pontoon</span> -- a <span class="DLF">pontoon bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And I remember we were coming down the <span class="DLF">hill</span> and one of the girls stood up and she started screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">She thought we were going to go right into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">But -- and the <span class="DLF">pontoon bridge</span> , you know, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pontoons</span> with something in between were just wide enough and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> went across very carefully. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So, that was an experience, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  Do you ever remember having any sense of whether or not the local people knew that there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">ANSWER:  No, I really --
QUESTION:  [indecipherable] have any --
ANSWER:  I really never mingled -- we really didn’t have that occasion and the only person was this maid that we had in our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and I don’t remember her name any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">She was July 14, 1995- really is -- I remember a very nice person. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And some of the girls said they asked her -- I never did -- and they said she didn’t know anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">But I mean, when things have come up like that, I said, “If terrible things go on in our <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , do we really know about it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I said, “Like the people living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sing-Sing</span> -- unless they know the guards who come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night, how really are you going to find out about things?” </span><span class="sentence" id="444">So I -- I don’t really know that you can really blame somebody and said they must have known. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">But I mean, how do you really know unless you knew somebody that had something to do with it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">QUESTION:  Well, in some cases, if there was a <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , there would be smoke and -- you know, thousands of people coming in and nobody coming out and --

QUESTION:  Camps?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">ANSWER:  Camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lucky Strike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And they wouldn’t let us take our dog in. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And the fella said, “No animals allowed, but when you go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> you can have him back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And we never saw him again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">QUESTION:  What was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">ANSWER:  Shloffin. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">It means he was sleepy. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">He was probably an older dog and he was such a nice dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">We have photographs of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And when we were going back, we went back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and then we’d take turns, you know, when the dog had to wee-wee, to jump off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Well, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would stop in the middle of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> -- <span class="REGION">wooded areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">We don’t know why it stopped, but it would stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And sometimes we’d be there a half hour and sometimes 10 minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Well, I know when I jumped off with the dog, and he’s going from one <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> to another as dogs do, all of a sudden the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started up. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">He didn’t stay very -- he must have been there five minutes and I’m running and I lifted up the dog and I can still remember all the hands and they took the dog and then s -- they grabbed me, because it was going faster and faster. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">So, I would still be there, I guess, if they hadn’t gotten me back on.</span></p>

ANSWER:  It wasn’t really the best, but it was the best in the circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I don’t think anything more could have been done. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And -- I mean, you could think of, when you run a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , what about the laundry service and what about this service and that service? </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And I guess it was all minimal. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Probably there wasn’t any laundry service. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">But I can remember that they had sheets or like -- because as -- I think they had straw as <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> July 14, 1995 and it seems to me that it was like 1n a -- you know a bag, like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleeping bag</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">You know, it would all be stuffed in there, otherwise it would be flying all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And it seems to me that’s what they had and I don’t remember that it was especially soiled or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">But I- | -- you know, when you look back all those years and you don’t pay that much attention and it’s -- you don’t really recall all that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="549">ANSWER:  Well, I think one thing was that we had lived together so closely. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">The whole time we were in Europe, until we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , we lived in these <span class="BUILDING">squad tents</span> and they were always five or six of us in a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> we lived in one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we had to fit into that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">There were always quite a number of us in each <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="553">So, you grew to be very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I think if we probably all had our own <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> -- and yet, in my nurses training we had our own <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and my class 1s still very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">We still -- in fact I go to all my -- my King’s County luncheons. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">We have one in <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> and we have July 14, 1995 one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I go to both of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">But most of the girls go to the one in <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">So most of them have moved out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and live there in <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">So -- but I think it’s the living closene -- and we all got along very well together. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I really don’t know of any enmity between anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">You know, ruffled feelings or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I think we’ve always gotten together. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">But I really -- I think I s -- have to pat myself on the back, because I think I started having us get together. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And there was a -- in 1947, that was the big snowstorm and I had arranged for us to have luncheon down at a <span class="BUILDING">Candlelight restaurant</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn Heights</span> , which was a lovely <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> in a brownstone, and they gave you popovers -- the whol -- the whole dinner they kept coming out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> with these delicious popovers and -- and we had this get together and -- with the storm that we had, two people came down from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> , Phyllis Law was one of them and Loreena, who passed away, was the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And Loreena says, “T was so amazed to see all that snow, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> has the snow usually.” </span><span class="sentence" id="567">But they didn’t have it and we were just snowed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And our chief nurse just couldn’t get there, she called me. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">She says, “I can’t get the <span class="DLF">doors</span> open.”</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="571">ANSWER:  I think we had about 10 -- 10 or 11. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And I believe we were expecting about 20, because they would be the people from the <span class="REGION">New York area</span> , but the two came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And -- but it was the big snowstorm. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And then they said that we had a reunion a-at Hotel Saint George Thet. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I said, “I’m sure it was the Candlelight,” because I know the one was at the Candlelight and I almost think we had two at the Candlelight. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And I July 14, 1995 kept calling the woman and -- who owned the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> and she says, “It’s perfectly all right,” cause I thought we’d be charged for all those dinners. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And she said no, it’s perfectly understandable, you know, when people can’t get in.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="583">ANSWER:  Well, I mean I was talking to the other girls earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I don’t know if you were there, but I mean what’s going on in today’s world. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I don’t think we’ve learned our lessons at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And I -- at that time, I felt just like the United Nations. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">We would all be getting along together and create an understanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I’ve been a member of the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> for quite a number of years and when I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , I went to a lot of their activities, but it seems worse to me than ever, which I can’t understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">QUESTION:  You were hopeful at the end of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">ANSWER:  I was very hopeful, yeah, that -- and -- but I mean, it’s all within the last 10 years that things have changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And it’s -- to me it’s so hard to understand, when we can all get along together and be happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">It’s very disillusioning to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And you would think after July 14, 1995 that experience of the Holocaust that everything would have dramatically changed, but -- and now these skinheads that you read about. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">They’re -- they even have them in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I mean, nobody seems to appreciate what they have. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> you have more of the good life, than you have al-almost, you know, almost any <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And -- cause I’m very much against these people -- what is it? </span><span class="sentence" id="598">That rifle group? </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I think they all help to perpetuate these terrible things that are going on and I think things are going to get worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">QUESTION:  Well, how do you think that, having witnessed what you witnessed, what kind of an impact did that have on you as a person, after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">ANSWER:  Well, mm -- well, I think that -- you know, everybody said it can’t happen again, you know, it just can’t happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And you know, we had a chaplain and he gave us all the- all these photographs. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">You probably saw them -- I don’t know whether you did or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">We all had a set of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">But I mean, those photographs were -- I think were worse than anything I really saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">You know, the bodies and the <span class="DLF">pits</span> and being buried and all this and that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I think that we were sort of shielded from that and -- and really didn’t see as much as in those photographs. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So, it’s hard to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And I mean, I happen to be German and I have relatives over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">I have never talked to them about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Well, they -- the younger ones, born way after, you know, they’re all about in their 30’s, but my cousin, she’s my second cousin, she’s about 65. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I never ch -- brought it up to her, I never talked to her, cause I was sort of embarrassed and I didn’t know how to bring it up and so I never really said anything to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And I had stayed with her parents once, when I July 14, 1995 first went to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I stayed with her parents for almost a week -- five or six days. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And they never really talked about the war, but -- and -- and in thir -- and in ‘58, you know, it wasn’t too far behind and they had one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I don’t know how that came up, whether I said something, what a nice <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> it was or not, I don’t recall and he said, “We were all out,” he said, “the children were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ,” and he and his wife -- he was at work and his wife was off someplace and when they came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was just rubble. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And he said, “I pulled that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> from the rubble.” </span><span class="sentence" id="618">He said, “It was the only thing that was any good.” </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And that’s all that was ever said. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I never said anything more, never brought it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">So, well I mean that’s no joke, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">But --
QUESTION:  What about since -- since that time? </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Have you ever had a conversation with somebody where they tried to tell you that the Holocaust didn’t happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">It’s only what I have been reading in the paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And I don -- really don’t know how they can believe that. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I mean, when all the evidence is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">I -- I -- to me, I can’t see -- it just doesn’t match up at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">How can you deny something when you have all the evidence? </span><span class="sentence" id="630">The photographs and you can go over there and see it and everything else, I really -- I -- I -- I -- well, I think we just have a lot of crackpots or something or other. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Just like those skinheads. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">They’re not all normal, they can’t be, to act the way they are and arousing all these anti feelings against people. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Cause I grew up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> where your friends are -- I had all kinds of -- I had black and white and Jewish and all and you just knew everybody and I -- a lot of my friends from childhood, I still keep up July 14, 1995 with and it’s -- you accept people for the way they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And maybe people growing up in smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> aren’t exposed to different types of people to that extent, and --
QUESTION:  Did you have Jewish friends growing up and in <span class="BUILDING">nursing school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">ANSWER:  Oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">I have a friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lakewood</span> , Lillian Sherr and -- and I always -- I say to Lillian, “How’d we ever get acquainted?” </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Because she’s about three or four years older than I am and she was working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">operating room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And we’re very good friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">QUESTION:  Do you ever remember her or anybody else saying something to you about the difficulties that the Jewish people were having in Europe before the war, do you -- were you conscious of that at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">ANSWER:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Now Lillian went into the army a -- but she was in <span class="COUNTRY">Burma</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And she will not speak about her army experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And lately I’ve been thinking about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I wonder why -- because I always thought so many of my experiences were so interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">But I once asked her about <span class="COUNTRY">Burma</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Sh -- a-and she’s different, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I should say -- I don’t want to -- she’d go like this, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="648">She don’t want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">So I really don’t know what went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">She never talked about her army experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">So it must have been a very unhappy experience for her, but --
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="652">ANSWER:  I don’t think they ever had anything to do with the native people. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And I would think going to <span class="COUNTRY">Burma</span> must have -- just to see the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">This is the 50th anniversary this year, of the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Has that made you think about your experience more, or is it -- July 14, 1995
ANSWER:  No, my -- someone asked me, “Aren’t you going to go to some of these reunions over in Europe?” </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And I said, “I have no desire to go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And I don’t know of any -- I haven’t heard of anybody that I know that has gone, except one man I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">But he’s very active in military organizations and that, but otherwise I really don’t -- and I have no desire to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I think maybe if a group of us had gone, that might have been something, but --
QUESTION:  Would you be interested, for example, in going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gusen</span> or -- or go to li -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">ANSWER:  Well, I’ve sort of wondered about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">I’ve been to Europe s-several times, but always with a group. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">When you’re on a tour, you can’t do what you want to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">But some of our people did go back and did -- I don’t think anybody in this group, you know, that’s here today, but I would say at least three people did go. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And -- I’m trying to think who they were that did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Woody might remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="667">QUESTION:  [inaudible]
ANSWER:  But I really don’t recall, but -- and I know one person said, “Well, it seemed to be the same as it was when we were there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And, but otherwise -- but I don’t have any burning desire to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">It was just a -- an unpleasant time of life and --
QUESTION:  That’s how you think about it, as something you’d rather forget?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Yeah, I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Yeah, I believe so, it’s -- you know, and then sometimes I wonder why -- you know, rehashing everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">You know, what is the real outcome of that going to be? </span><span class="sentence" id="674">But I think the reason was so that 1t wouldn’t happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">But -- but July 14, 1995 when you think of what people do to people, what’s going on today, I don’t think it’s had any influence whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Anything I didn’t ask you about that you would like to talk about or tell me about or --
ANSWER:  Well, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">It’s only that once in awhile something that’s said, you know, brings up another idea, but otherwise, just some funny incidences and I really -- I don’t think so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">ANSWER:  I think we covered the highlights.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">QUESTION:  Okay, good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">ANSWER:  Unless you want to hear about my German prisoner of war that helped us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gusen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">QUESTION:  Course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">ANSWER:  I don’t always tell it, because some people don’t really think it’s -- anyhow, he was a very -- I don’t think he was more than 18 - 17 and he lost his meat can -- you know, that’s the -- it’s a two part dish -- I still have mine at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- and you have your silverware on the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and when you go to get something to eat, you open it up and you have two parts and they put the food in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And then you wash it and put it together again. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Well, he came on duty and he hung, I guess, a jacket and -- and his meat can on the back of a <span class="DLF">door</span> -- happened to be a hook there. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Well -- and then he came to me and he told me in German that his meat can was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And I said, “Are you sure you left it there?” </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">So I started looking under everybody’s pillow. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And I’m climbing on all these tiers and looking under. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I finally found it. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">My God, he was practically kneeling every time I July 14, 1995 passed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Cause he told me he’d be killed if he -- 1f it was found out that he lost it. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Oh, he was so frightened, oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Which 1s why I really worked very hard to find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And I did find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Oh, he was frantic. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">He was just a kid, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And we had German prisoners of war when I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dupont</span> and I had some funny experiences with them, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">QUESTION:  Before you went overseas?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">ANSWER:  Before I went over. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">You know, we had 10,000 prisoners there at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dupont</span> and when we were on night duty, we worked from seven pm to seven am, 12 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And then you got an extra day off for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">You did that for two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">So the prisoners, when they -- when we were preparing for them, we had just a very small <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with three <span class="INT_SPACE">wards</span> and s -- and some <span class="INT_SPACE">private rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And the prisoners of war were at least a mile away. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">We had quite a big <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there, but it was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">So they put their <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> as far away as you could go. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">How I wished I had roller skates. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Cause you had to go down there and gave out -- you put out the medicines. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">I put them in all little medicine glasses with the name of the person. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Cause we had a ward man who was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">He gave out all the medicines, he did everything except the narcotics and the injections. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">So he called me one night, 1t was pouring rain and he said, “We’re being flooded down here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And -- because I could understand him, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And so -- and -- and one of the duties of the night nurse was to run across an open <span class="DLF">ramp</span> into the <span class="INT_SPACE">nurses quarters</span> and close all the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And we had these rainstorms that came up in <span class="REGION">Delaware</span> in a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And it just came down, you can’t imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And so I had just come back from the <span class="INT_SPACE">nurses quarters</span> -- you ran into everybody’s <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , closing <span class="DLF">windows</span> -- and the telephone call came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">So I ran down July 14, 1995 there and they had a guard and he had a whole ring, like this, of keys. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And -- and he -- well, anyhow, I said, “I got to find out what’s happening in here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="723">So I got in there and they had all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> pulled to the center and the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> was wet. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">There were a couple of inches of water on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and everything, the bed linen was wet. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">I know I had to go back and get more bed linen, cause they didn’t have enough, because they didn’t use that much, you know, at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And -- and they got me a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> -- oh, and we had bars on all the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Not regular bars, but screening, that metal screening, each one with a lock and they were not in succession. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">So I’m looking for the key, got that <span class="DLF">window</span> open, opened it, they close it, we locked that again. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Go to the next <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="730">By then somebody moved the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> , I got up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> , got that <span class="DLF">window</span> o -- closed -- and the next one. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">So finally I said, “For heavens sakes, will you find the right key? </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Go down while I’m working on this <span class="DLF">window</span> and you get that lock for that <span class="DLF">window</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Well, and we had one <span class="DLF">window</span> next to another, we must have had 40 <span class="DLF">windows</span> on that ward. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Well, I can tell you, about -- af -- seven o’clock in the morning I was down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> of the man that was in charge of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And he got a -- heard from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">I says, “There 1s absolutely no sense to what you people have done.” </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I said, “First of all, you don’t need those metal screens on those <span class="DLF">windows</span> , that’s asinine.” </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I said, “And if they get out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> , how are they going to go further?” </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Because there were big bars and sc -- that curly --
QUESTION:  Concertina wire?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I said, “How can anybody get over that?” </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And I said, “And where are they going to go if they get out? </span><span class="sentence" id="743">There isn’t any <span class="NPIP">place</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="744">I said, “They can’t get any food, July 14, 1995 nobody’ ll have anything to do with them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And the next night, they were all off. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Everything was off those <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">That I remember vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Well, anyhow, while I was jumping from one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> to the other, one of them says, in German, he said, “She’s like the little old lady who lived in a shoe, she had so many children, she didn’t know what to do.” </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Well, I burst out laughing, I couldn’t help it. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And I was supposed to be very stern, you see, they were our enemies. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">But I just couldn’t -- they were all young people, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I couldn’t help it. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I was accused of being too friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">I couldn’t help it. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">I was going with a fellow then and he said, “The word 1s that you’re too friendly.” </span><span class="sentence" id="756">I says, “I can’t help it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I said, “They’re nice young men.” </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Most of them were very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And there was one fellow that had -- had -- I think he had his appendix out. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And -- and they -- they get morphine, you know, every four hours if they need it. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">So I prepared, up at my <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- we kept the -- the morphine and those drugs, you know, they didn’t have them down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">So I went down with my syringe and -- course Hans, as I remember, had called me and said he was in terrible pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">So I went down and the poor fellow, when he saw me, the sweat started coming and he was in awful pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">He -- and he’s inching away back toward the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">He saw me with the syringe and I remember Hans said, “He’s -- he thinks you’re going to kill him. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Put him to sleep or something.” </span><span class="sentence" id="767">So I’m trying to tell him, you know, this is for -- to help him. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">See, they were so -- so -- I mean the tales that we heard on our side, they also heard against us. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">So anyhow -- so I finally got him -- gave it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">He was almost fighting me, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And he was in terrible pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">It was probably gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">July 14, 1995
