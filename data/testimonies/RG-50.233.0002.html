<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  So, we'll just begin with your name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My name is Inge Auerbacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I was born in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in <span class="REGION">Southern Germany</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kippenheim</span> It’s a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> at that time about 2,000 people, very close to the borders of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and we had about 60 Jewish families living there. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">We were all quite Orthodox in a modern way. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> on Friday nights and Sabbath, and we were really a very nice community. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Most of the Jewish people had little <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> there or were cattle dealers and that is a profession that a great many Jews in <span class="REGION">Southern Germany</span> were involved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">In fact, my grandparents, the grandfathers actually on both sides, my mother’s side, my mother’s father and mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">On that <span class="NPIP">side</span> , my grandfather was cattle dealer there and my grandfather from my father’s side was also a cattle dealer and skin and hide business. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I did not know my grandparents on my father’s side; his parents, they had died before my parents got married and my father was one out of six children; my mother one out of two. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And I did know my grandparents from my mother’s side with whom I had a very close relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">They live about four or five hours away in an even smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> than the one I was born in. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jebenhausen</span> , when mine was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kippenheim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">In fact, my grandmother’s, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where my grandparents lived had famous person roots there too, by the name of Albert Einstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Albert Einstein had spent quite a few summers in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , I believe his grandmother or aunt and uncle, somebody in that family had a little <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> there, and he visited quite often. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I don’t recall ever seeing him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Of course he was quite grown at that time already and somehow it was not even known that he was such a famous man. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I mean he was a little boy at that time and nobody ever spoke about that again. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I only found out about this much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I did not play with any non-Jewish children in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I mainly spent my time with Jewish children and anyway I only spent about four or five years in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">It was, we had a good relationship with the people in, the Christian people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kippenheim</span> , but we lived separate lives and a good co-existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">But there was always some undercurrents of anti- Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">That’s what my parents told me too. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">We had a very large <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , about 17 <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">We had servants. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Some of, I don’t remember that much of my little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , just mainly some things about going to the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> , the holidays; I was the last Jewish child born in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and one of the main events that I will never forget is Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Actually I don’t remember November 9. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Nothing much happened really on that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I remember November 10 and our <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> was demolished. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">It was not set aflame because the neighboring <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , there were a lot of Christian neighboring <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and they were afraid that they would burn too. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">But it was completely ransacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">My mother saw how the 1 Ten Commandments were thrown from the top, they were set on top of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and how they were thrown down. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I remember the day of the 10". </span><span class="sentence" id="34">My grandparents had come to visit us and my grandfather got up early in the morning to go to <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> to morning services; he was a very Orthodox man. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">My father and my, we actually still in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and the bell rang and the police came in and they said that all Jewish men are now under arrest and that my father should dress immediately and report to <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Then I remember when my father left, our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was stone. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">All the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were broken in the entire <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my mother and I and my grandmother had to find shelter in a nearby <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">We had like a <span class="BUILDING">courtyard</span> and there was like a little area in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> that was used as a <span class="INT_SPACE">storage area</span> and we hid in there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  Who were throwing the stone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  Some of, some boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Who, I mean I really didn’t even see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">We just heard the noise, you know, when the, in fact when the stone were being thrown I remember we were standing, I believe it was the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , and they were looking at the chandelier in our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and they said, oh look at this! </span><span class="sentence" id="43">The chandelier is still standing, it’s still hanging and they threw a big brick inside the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and it nearly hit me and my mother just pulled me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">That’s when we went for the neighboring <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> and the servant girl was with us at that time, but she was afraid and she ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Then they were knocking at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , there was a big, we had this <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and a big <span class="DLF">door</span> in front of it and we heard them knocking and rattling the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and but luckily they did not come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">The boys, we were told later, some of them were some young boys from neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and perhaps some from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I did not see them do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">But as I said, my mother looked through the broken <span class="DLF">window</span> and she saw how the Ten Commandments were thrown down. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And here in the <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> we stayed for many, many hours until it was quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">In the meantime, all the men who had reported to the <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> and the ones who were in the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> were arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So my grandfather never came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">They took all these men to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Then we went to a neighboring <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> , where also all of the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were broken and to find some shelter and we came. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I think we stayed, my mothers that. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I do not remember it that we stayed overnight with friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And then we went back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and of course everything was filled up with broken glass, the whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> had to be boarded up because it was winter of course and it was quite cold already. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">November is already cold in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And my father had been a disabled war veteran of World War I. He was wounded on his right shoulder quite badly and he could not raise his right arm and he was quite a good patriot, I mean he loved <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , so my grandfather he said he was born in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , he would never leave it. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">He loved his little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jebenhausen</span> and he was very happy there. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And my father always said why should we leave here? </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I mean I fought for this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ; I was wounded for this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ; I mean nothing 1s going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">We were very good citizens like, I mean Americans here, if you are, if you were born in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> or even if you become a citizen, you pledge allegiance to that 2 <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and we pledged our allegiance to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">We had hundreds of years, my family had lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I fact, one of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ’s most famous poets and writers was Berthal Auerbach, who made the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Black Forest</span> famous. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">He name was Moses Baruch Auerbacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">He live about a hundred years ago and he become world famous. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">His books were published in many languages including English. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">He wrote a lot about the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Black Forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Well, after a few weeks that my grandfather and my father were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , they came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">My mother had bought a bogus ticket to <span class="COUNTRY">Trinidad</span> , and she went to some <span class="BUILDING">SS headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I don’t remember exactly the neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and she begged for his release and that she had tickets for us to leave and she did get my father out at that time and soon afterwards my grandfather came out too and then we heard of all of the terrible things that happened to them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and one of them my father related that he had to...they had to stand for hours on end in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> in the exercise area in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> with their striped uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Of course all of their clothes were take away and in fact to transgress a little bit my...and one of the SS people...police people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kippenheim</span> came to my mother’s...our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he brought a basketful of ties and belts and he said oh, here are the remnants of your men, so my mother thought for sure everybody had been killed by now. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I mean these are the clothes, the ties, the belts and I believe some shirts and things and, but anyway when they were there of course they had to give up all their clothing and wore the striped uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And they had to stand at attention for 10-12 hours at a time and if somebody tried to blow their nose...it was quite cold in...I mean the suits were a flimsy kind of pajama type of suits, they were hosed down with cold, ice cold water and this happened one to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Now my grandfather had a very bad heart condition and of course this made it even worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">He was not an old man, he was in his early sixties at that time and when he came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> he died very soon afterwards of...actually 1t was a combination of a broken heart physically and mentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">He was just so disappointed in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that he loved and that this could happen to him and he saw the writing on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , but he would never leave it. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">He said I was born here, and I will die here no matter what happens.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  Do you remember what your father looked like when he came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Do you remember anything particular about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  I remember just one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">It was quite kind of cold in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I don’t know, I think we had enough coal or something to heat one or two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and I remember, I was a tiny little girl at that time, I was not even four years old, I remember sitting on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">potty</span> , I remember that I my prayer book in my hand, I’m praying for my daddy to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I could not read or write at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I remember when he came, he threw a stone at the <span class="DLF">boarded up window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">He didn’t ring the bell and he came. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I don’t remember what he looked like, no I did not, but I know my parents talked in hushed voices, I mean that I should not hear what happened and he told my mother, now it’s really time. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">We must leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">There is no way that we can stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And my mother started to write some letters to relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">There were a few who had done quite well, 3 especially an uncle of his who became quite well-to-do in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and the letter, the answer we received from the family was well, we have a bad recession and depression here and you would only add to the number of people unemployed and you better stay where you are, and that was the answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And we just could not get the affidavits, the papers to come here because my father needed to have a higher affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">He had to have a sponsor who was willing to have enough money that in case he could not work, there would be no welfare for us; we had to have our own money and my father needed more because he was a disabled war veteran so they figured that he may not get a job here and we would become a burden to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So that made it even harder. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And in the meantime some of my relatives, my father’s sisters, two of them, had gotten papers to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> and they did leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">They managed to get out and a brother of my mother, her only brother, received papers from an uncle of my aunts to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , so they managed to get here. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And my uncle fought in the American Army in World War II while he was here. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">We did not get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So after 1938, after Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass, after that program we decided we have to find some way to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">so we sold the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at a very cheap price and moved in with my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And then my grandfather died. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And it was around...that was in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I remember the best time for me of my childhood was in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jebenhausen</span> where we had moved in with my grandparents and I had many Christian friends, and my grandparents were the last Jewish family living in this tiny little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where more Jews had lived before. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They had moved away and become big industrialists in the neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Girpingen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I had a very nice time with Christian children and I remember many times I would be the cheerleader walking up and down the <span class="DLF">hill</span> singing the songs of the day which were Nazi songs and I would be the one who would be the cheerleader leading them on. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I did know what the real meaning behind these songs were, but I was so caught up with the charisma and the chemistry of this day, of this tremendous upheaval and I didn’t know that these people, one of their primary ideas was to hate the Jews! </span><span class="sentence" id="106">We must get rid of the Jews! </span><span class="sentence" id="107">The children there did not make me feel bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">They did not call me any bad names and they were really my friends and some of them are still my friends today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  Did you know that you were a Jew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  I knew that I was Jew, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But it...somehow it did not occur to me to think that I was really any different. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I mean nobody talked to me from these children you know, why do you do this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I knew that they celebrated Christmas and in fact I was a little envious of them because it was a very beautiful holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Always they received many toys and the Christmas tree and so many of those decorations and all and we didn’t have that and that was kind of an enviable time for me because everybody was celebrating and of course my grandparents tried very hard to make me feel good about Hanukkah and sort of to make me feel proud that I was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I was brought up in a very good <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> ; an <span class="BUILDING">observant Jewish home</span> in a modern kind of way. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I mean during Sabbath, it was really Sabbath. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We did not do any work, we were not allowed to write or do any manual labor, 4 etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">It was...all of the things of the Sabbath, I mean the way we celebrated was the regular observant way. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">There was no <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jebenhausen</span> , so we walked to the neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Girpingen</span> to go to a prayer service and we were not allowed to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So we walked the three kilometers back and forth through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> ...there was a <span class="DLF">road</span> through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Girpingen</span> in the neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , had been completely burnt to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So there was like an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in converted into a <span class="INT_SPACE">prayer area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">In fact at that time they didn’t have a rabbi any more and my father made the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">He was very good in Hebrew and he led the service for the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">In 1940 I began my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> career. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And Jewish children were not allowed to go to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">There was one <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for the State of Wuerttemburg. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">That was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So I had to travel, in fact I had to get travel permission papers to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">First I had to walk the three kilometers to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and then take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> , which was another hour, and then walk by myself to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">In the beginning, my father took me with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and he took me to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and then he had...and then the law came out that all Jewish people had to do some work...kind of a slave labor and my mother had to sew in a <span class="BUILDING">corset factory</span> , a women’s undergarment factory and my father became the cutter. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Although he never did this kind of work before, he had at that time, I mean before all of this happened, he had his own <span class="BUILDING">textile business</span> selling dry goods. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Mainly wholesale and retail to different <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> and also private people. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">He sold different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Linen and dry goods. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And after they had to do this slave labor, I had to travel all by myself to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and it became quite difficult when we had to start to wear the star, the yellow star and that became a huge problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And my father said to me...in fact the star...I was such a little girl still. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I was six years old and from the age of six in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> all the people had to wear the yellow star with the word Jew on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">My star covered most of my left side, I mean I was still a little girl and he said when you sit down on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , sit in such a way that you can normally cover up the star. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">In other words, like bent over on your left side. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">It had to be worn on the left side over my breast, you know on the left side. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And so I did this and I was always nervous because there were these rowdy school children who would go from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to the next by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they would be very fresh and they would stare and people always tried to have conversation with me in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Why are you going all alone to...traveling by yourself and by the age if six to go all by yourself to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> so far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I mean why don’t you go in your own <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And it was very hard to answer them. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">They made me very nervous and scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I remember in the morning when I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> there was always a very mean policeman who would be sometimes at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and that really gave me a scare in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I had to get up very, very early in the morning to make the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I remember once a woman, a Christian woman, she realized that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">She left...when she left, she left a bag of rolls in a paper bag right next to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">She didn’t say a word, but she left that forme. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And to me she...I mean she was resisting what was going on but in a silent way, but nevertheless she had the heart to think of that Jewish child who might wanted to eat those rolls; she wanted to do some kindness to that Jewish child, but very afraid to talk to me, but she realized she was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I remember also at that time 5 I had to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> I think it was third class. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> you had second and first class <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I remember a group of prisoners...they may have been Russian prisoners or Polish, I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">But they were also herded to somewhere and how they would sit in the <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> and sharing a cup of something or

<p><span class="sentence" id="198">ANSWER:  My doll’s name is Marlene . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">She was named after Marlene Dietrich, whom I idolized. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I loved movie stars and so did my mother and she showed me once an album with a picture of her in it and that...I said that’s going to be my doll’s name. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">She was given to me on my second birthday from my grandmother and I still have her today and I donated this doll to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> recently, with great trepidation, because I really dragged her through everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Now the transport notice said all of these things we could take along. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We had to assemble in a <span class="BUILDING">school gymnasium</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Girpingen</span> , the people who were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , and mainly the people who were in my transport were disabled war veterans and old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And we were searched in the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And I remember I had my doll in my arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I would not relinquish her at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And I remember one of the people, the SS people who searched us, took a look at my doll and lifted her head. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">She was like...her head had been once broken and they put a new head on and therefore she was put together with rubber bands and you could lift the head up. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So he looked inside her hollow body. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">It was a celluloid doll. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">That’s the kind of dolls you had at those times and he saw that I didn’t have any...I wasn’t hiding anything <span class="NPIP">inside</span> so I made a really big noise there and I wasn’t going to give my doll up. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And I was the youngest child in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and then he let me have my doll. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Then he saw a wooden pin pinned to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And he tore that from me and he said in German [“du brochest net fur du ingege’’] in real [swabian] dialect. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">In other words, you don’t need this where you are going. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So he tore it from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">That was the last childish thing I had besides my doll. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">7
QUESTION:  What was the pin?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">ANSWER:  It was a little Dutch Boy pin. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">A wooden pin that my mother had given me. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And I remember my mother said we have to two or three different layers of clothing although it was summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Because you never know what’s going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So she put on me a few dresses and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">It was really hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">But you know you have to have some more clothing on you because you never knew what was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">At least you would have that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="361">QUESTION:  Every day you would see them or...

[mischlinge] and she attended some of those services with her father and her father made sure that she was not brought up as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And he was very proud of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Although she was basically Jewish, because the mother was completely Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Her name was Ruth Abraham from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Now we lived with them for more than a year in the small, tiny, tiny little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where six people lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I mean three of us and three of them until ’44. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">When, I mean there were transports to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> many, many times during that time and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> were selected according to the whims of the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Always around 1,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And whenever Eichmann came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> you knew very well that another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Many more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Ruth and I attended the underground classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">The so-called beshefticum classes which were held in different areas, sometimes in the <span class="BUILDING">children’s home</span> , sometimes in a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">We both attended those and we didn’t have official school books and really not official teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">We were taught by people who remembered anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I had for instance some English lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Some people who remembered English, or Hebrew or whatever they could teach us. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Our parents also they drilled us to do the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">times table</span> , for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">It was very important to keep our minds a little bit busy and to learn poems. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">For instance, Ruth’s father was a very good poet and he made her recite poems. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I mean to memorize these poems. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">The same with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">She was a good poet too and you always for birthdays, that was our birthday gift to our parents to recite a poem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">QUESTION:  Do you remember a poem you recited?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">ANSWER:  I don’t remember, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I don’t remember at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">My birthdays were celebrated in a fashion, for instance, I got a new outfit for my doll sewn from rags or I got a small potato cake the size of a child’s palm with a tiny hint of sugar on it, just made from a mashed potato. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Potatoes were like diamonds. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">In fact, I wrote in my book, I am star about diamonds on the snow, how my father had gotten some potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">He would go around, my father didn’t have an official job. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Sometimes he would get some coal dust and he would bring it to the old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I mean they couldn’t get it for themselves for the, you know for the heating of the small ovens and they would give him a piece of bread for it or some potatoes. [</span><span class="sentence" id="422">End of side 1. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Set <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">counter</span> to zero for side 2]. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">It was really forbidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">You could be sent out either to a small <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span> which was a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> for the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> about a mile away or be sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> immediately if you were caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Because in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we had the ghetto police, mainly, actually made up of Jewish people who were policing the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Also you had surrounding the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> you had the Germans or Czech gendarmes guarding the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> armed with guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Then I remember she had gotten some of these potatoes and we had a few pounds of 12 these and they were really like diamonds because we did not get enough food. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I mean the rations were very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">I don’t have to, I believe, go into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I mean we know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> food was like and so a potato became the mainstay or an extra portion of soup, watery soup that we got. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Of course in the morning it was just a murky liquid called coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">We had to stand three times a day in <span class="DLF">line</span> in the big fortress courtyards to get our food
QUESTION:  You would stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">ANSWER:  I would stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">In fact, the <span class="INT_SPACE">children’s kitchen</span> was somewhere else from the adults and the food was very much the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I mean children did not get very much more. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I mean there was hardly ever any milk, and if there was, it was for, 1t was so watered down or children with TB and things like that who got sometimes a little bit more. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Almost everybody had it anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And there was a rumor going around that we were going to have an inspection in our <span class="DLF">block</span> and the inspection was by women, ausewiber they called them. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">An especially very mean SS women who would search the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">We would have to leave the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and if even one cigarette or one potato would be found, that would be the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">So we were sleeping on the potatoes and we didn’t know what to do with these potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">So my father found a plan and he found an old suitcase and put some of these potatoes in and was the death of night and you actually a curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">You weren’t supposed to be out of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and the lights were supposed to be out. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">There was a full moon. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So he had a plan to put these potatoes under a pile of rags, that they should not freeze. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">In the, what was called die soigelings heim where some of the babies were kept in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> there was this big heap of rags. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And he took...in the middle of the night he ran out and he fell and all of the potatoes were on the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">So he picked them up and he hid them under this pile of rags. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Now in the meantime, these women came and we were told to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and assemble. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And I remember I was so afraid with my doll that one of them would break him, I don’t remember if I left the doll there or if I took the doll with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">But it was dangerous take anything with you because they thought you were hiding something and that’s how we saved, and then a day later when the <span class="DLF">coast</span> was clear; they didn’t find anything, then they...we got the potatoes back. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I remember the worst day for me was a day in 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">It was November 11. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">The rumor went around that people were missing; that people had escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And perhaps some people did escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">But of course it was very hard to get out because you had to jump from the high <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And if you did, you broke most of your bones and who would help you then. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And even if you did get out in one piece, who would help you when you got out? </span><span class="sentence" id="461">People didn’t know anybody on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to give you some food or where to go, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">and I mean you had the SS guarding the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And we were herded out one cold November morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Always something happened between 9", 10, or 11 of November, starting from Kristallnacht on. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Every November 9", 10", 11", we were always afraid something terrible would happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">We were herded outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Bauschewitz Kastle</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Bauschewitz Revine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And everybody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Sick or half- 13 dead, everybody was marched out. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And we were standing in little groups and I remember Heindel, one of the worst and meanest SS men kept on walking around and counting and beating people when they lost their way and we didn’t get food all day. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">There were no <span class="DLF">bathrooms</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">It was just a horrible, horrible day. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">It was now I know what was supposed to happen on that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">I think that they really did not only want to count us. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Probably what they wanted to do is either shoot down, Babi Yar style or send the whole transport to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> on that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Because news had leaked out to the British radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And that we were all standing there, about 50,000-60,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">It was raining. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I remember our feet sank into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mud</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">It was just an awful day. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Mice were running around in that <span class="DLF">field</span> and that news had leaked out and consequently orders came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to let us go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And we went back in the death of night, maybe 11:00-12:00 And they were beating us. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">We were holding on to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">They said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Men and women should be separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">We wouldn’t let go of each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">My mother was beaten up very badly that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">One of the butts of a rifle went right into my mother’s back because we would not separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">We were holding on to each other and we went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And soon afterwards you had this commission from the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And I remember it very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">The whole <span class="NPIP">place</span> had to be cleaned up. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Certain <span class="DLF">streets</span> had signs on them...To <span class="BUILDING">School</span> ...To <span class="DLF">Playground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="493">A band shell was erected in the <span class="DLF">park</span> , a <span class="DLF">park</span> that we were never even allowed to go to and children were given some better food just as the commission went by. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">I think I saw the commission but we were not allowed to go out of our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I just saw them from far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">A film was made at that time to show supposedly the good conditions of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Soon afterwards when the commission had left, everything went back to where it was before. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> began again. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">In fact, the worst <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> were in 1944, in the fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">It was during the High Holidays in September and October. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And I remember how the people even fasted on Yom Kippur and afterwards went on the transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I remember how they put on their boots, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">and prayed with their last breathes, so to speak, God Help Us. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I remember one of the prayers Alvenu Malkenu, God Help Us. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I mean they did not know where they were really going that this was a worse <span class="NPIP">place</span> even than where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">That this was going to be their death. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">They did not know it, but you always feared things would be worse somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">We were not told about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , although the camp elders did know about it. [</span><span class="sentence" id="509">Leobeken] the people knew about this <span class="NPIP">place</span> ... knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And it was that time when Mrs. Rinder and her whole family was shipped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I mean the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was almost completely empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Ruth and her parents were shipped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Just before they were shipped out, all of the disabled war veterans had to go the <span class="BUILDING">SS headquarters</span> and the selection took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And my father when he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> he said “Well I was told to go the girl with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> , and I saw her...them put a red circle around our name, and I think we don’t have to go”’. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And surely enough, that’s what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And the Abrahams, who had...I mean they were really not even...I mean he was half Jewish, they should have helped him. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And my father said “Why didn’t you tell him, why didn’t you do something?” </span><span class="sentence" id="518">He said “Well, you are all going to come sooner or later, wherever we're going”. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">So the whole family was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I 14 remember, for instance, disabled war veterans who had very important parts, I don’t need to go into certain things, genitals shot off. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I remember one who even took his, my father told me, he dropped his pants to show them that he was wounded so badly and he had all these catheters in and out and even he was shipped off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I mean the selection was very brutal and you really were not safe just because you were a disabled war veteran or even if you were a highly decorated war veteran. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I mean there were transports with EK-1 Iron Cross, one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> who were shipped out in mass or sometimes only doctors, sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">It depended exactly what they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Old people, young people, whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And I remember also during the...to transgress a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Some things that come back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I mean that was really the saddest time for me because I had really loved my girlfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">We were like two sisters and before she went, we had identical dolls and she gave me...
