<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  What efforts did you make to try and find members of your family, and friends?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="648">ANSWER:  Well, if they have a lot of — cause maybe they had asked — because most of our family are Holocaust survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And whenever they didn’t speak to us, they must have spoken to them, because they didn’t want to bring it up to us, we shouldn’t cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Or they shouldn’t hurt us, or they didn’t know how to put it. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">But whenever they got together with their cousins, they always used to talk or ask somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">It’s easier sometimes to ask a stranger, than your own.</span></p>
