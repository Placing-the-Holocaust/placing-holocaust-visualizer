<p><span class="sentence" id="608">ANSWER:  Yeah I -- no-now I -- I know, he planned -- we -- he met with the -- like I said that he -- he was the carpenter, and responsible, he had the crew, people working. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">One of the crew, it was Berestitsky, Jacob. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">He was a [indecipherable] and a religious man. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And my father k-k-keep him, you know, to -- to work for him, and Berestitsky approached my father and said, “Heger, I know that you are building and building those <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> , but you ha -- you -- you will not succeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">In the end they will kill you and kill your family.” </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And they started to think about where you can hide, and they came to a plan that 1-in the <span class="DLF">sewer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And my father remembered the <span class="DLF">sewer</span> because when it was built -- because it was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Peltew</span> <span class="RIVER">Peltew</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And because of the stench and the -- you know, the hygiene, the -- th-they decided in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">municipality</span> in the early 900, they decided, you know, that they have to cover this. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And they used -- my father was little when he was going and watching the -- the people who are working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">They -- the Italian POW’s were building this, because it was <span class="REGION">Galicia</span> that’s time, you know, different politics, different -- and they were building this and my fa-father remembered how they built, he -- he -- he remember how it look like. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And they came to a p-plan, you know, that t-to -- to -- to maybe, you know, to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And they started to dig, they were digging from this <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , then they came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">When they came down, they -- they saw a light from a lamp, and th-three people came to them and they ask, what are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="621">They were sewer workers, that they, y-you know, k-k-keep control of the <span class="DLF">sewers</span> if everything is normal -- 1-in order working, you know, in order. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">They keep the -- the maintenance of the sew -- maintenance worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And my father said to him, you -- you know, I’m looking for <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide my family from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Now he started to laugh, and th-th-they were starting to talk, and then he -- he sa -- he said he wants to do what he did and he look and he said, it is not so bad, but y -- w-we can help you, but if -- for a pay -- payment. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And he mentioned some amount of money, it was a big amount of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And my father said to him, okay, I will bring you tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And when w -- they came to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , you know, th-th- they -- few people were involved in this, it was Berestitsky, it was Weiss, and some his friends, and Weiss s-said to my father that he is stupid that he agreed to pay him so much money. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And my father said, what else can I lose? </span><span class="sentence" id="629">I-I have to try. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And next day he came back and he gave to -- to -- to Socha money, and Socha wanted -- then Socha came up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , and this is when I saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And then later on he said when we were 1-in -- in the <span class="DLF">sewer</span> sitting, he said that he decided to save us when he saw my mother sitting with those two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And he said, I saw this picture, it looked like a chicken with the hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And this is when I decided that I will sa -- try to save you. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Was your -- would you characterize your father then as an optimist? </span><span class="sentence" id="635">You know, y-y -- all these terrible things are happening and then this idea that he would give a lot of money to someone he barely knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Do you think you would think of your father then as just -- I mean, obviously very determined, but do you think he was generally very optimistic?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">QUESTION:  He -- he -- he was optimistic per-person, but he was too, very determined, and he didn’t, you know, lose the -- the believing that he can save us. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">He -- he -- he grab everything what can d -- he -- he grabbed, only to -- to save us. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And he was person who -- who t -- took risks. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Because I -- if my father wouldn’t take risk, we wouldn’t be alive, because it was during the -- you know, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> time, it was so many times that he t-took risk, and I-I-I -- and he stay alive, that I-I-I-I -- I- | don’t -- sometimes you know, I’m thinking and I don’t know what is -- is it, 1t was a luck? </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Most of the t -- of the time I think it was luck that -- that we are alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I-I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">My mother believe in something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">She believed it -- it was a f -- the omen from -- from a high power that We S -- we -- we were chosen to -- to stay av -- stay alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Maybe she is ri -- she was right, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">But my father was ve -- he was optimistic I can say, because I cannot say that somebody who will be, you know, very pessimist and depress, h-he would give up mu -- much early.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">QUESTION:  Do you have any idea how much money your father wound up paying Socha?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="648">ANSWER:  I don’t know how much money he gave him from the bi -- when he went down, but it must be biv -- a -- a lot of money because wi -- Weiss was screaming a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">That’s why I think it was a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And they -- and they -- we -- he agreed to pay him every day, 500 zlotys. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">500 zlotys at that time, it was probably even 200 dollars each time. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">You know, each day when he came, he -- he was buying food for this, and then wa -- what’s stay, it was for -- for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">QUESTION:  And your father was able to save a lot of money somewhere without, obviously the Nazis -- the Germans finding his resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">ANSWER:  I -- I think so because otherwise how -- how he would have? </span><span class="sentence" id="655">I think that one of the <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> that my father built, tha-tha -- I think he kept th-the money and he kept the jewelry. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Because later we -- we paid with jewelry, too.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="660">QUESTION:  Tell me what’s going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">ANSWER:  This -- this was, I think end of May, May 30 or beginning o-of June, that 1t was a liquidation and this is why the people started to run and be run t-to -- to th -- to the <span class="DLF">sewer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And this was in 1943, the beginning of June 1943, and I was at that time, I was like seven and half, yeah, and my brother was f-four years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And a-at that time, and d-during this panic, lot of people came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I don’t know if lot of people came down through our <span class="DLF">entrance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I think that -- more that they thought because people find out that this is an <span class="DLF">entrance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">But lot of people came from the -- from the <span class="DLF">manholes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And th-th-th-then 1-it was s-s-such a y-y-you know, screaming and yelling and th-th-th-th-the falling water, and th-the echo. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">It-It-It sounded so terribly, and you -- you know, the <span class="DLF">ledge</span> that we were walking, it was maybe one foot wide, and we had to walk, we had to -- with our back to the <span class="DLF">walls</span> , and slide, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="669">But from the beginning when we went down, I remember that my father -- I was -- h-he was holding me on his back and my mother was holding my brother, and this is how we walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Then I ask him constantly where are were going, where are we going, and he -- he co-constantly wa-was you know, telling me, don’t worry, don’t worry, you will be okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Wa -- and we pa -- we had to pass on the other side o-of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and I was so scared, there was such a -- a narrow <span class="DLF">passage</span> I-like a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , small narrow <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , and I was so scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">We passed to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Somehow we wind out 1-1n the one of the branches of th-th-this <span class="DLF">sewer</span> , looked like a <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">A-And so many rats, a-a-and, you know, the stench, 1-1-1-it was t -- a-a-and the w-w-w -- webs of the -- the spider webs. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Wherever we -- we went we had to push the spiderwe-webs aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And we stayed there, 1-it was lot of people, I think maybe some 70 or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Lot of people there, a-and then after Socha came and sh -- he ju -- he took a group only of people because he couldn’t, you know, support -- he took like I think 21 people, and we went to different <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> , and we were sitting there for -- for long time, I -- I think maybe two or three weeks, or maybe longer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">QUESTION:  And where is this -- you know, most of us haven’t obviously been in a <span class="DLF">sewer system</span> , so where is the sewage? </span><span class="sentence" id="680">You’re sitting in this <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  And o-on the -- on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , the sewage, it -- you -- you -- and the waste is coming on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="688">QUESTION:  Were you complaining as a -- as a young child in your first encounters with the actual sewage flowing by, were you complaining at all? </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Or were you aware that this was your, you know, possible escape for freedom?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">ANSWER:  I wasn’t complaining. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I -- I -- I was s-scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I was very scared but I didn’t complain because I -- you know, I believe in my father, and I thought that he said I have to go there, that I have to go there, no complaints. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And we were sitting in this one -- space 21 of [indecipherable] we got very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">We got dysentery, we were very weak, we didn’t have water to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">My father used to go miles on his knees and elbows and he was keeping a teakettle in his teeth and he was walking like this, he f-found this <span class="NPIP">place</span> when the -- drinking water from a <span class="DLF">fountain</span> , in the main -- main <span class="BUILDING">market</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Was dripping from the statue, the statue of Neptune. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And he found this water and he was bringing, and he wa -- the water for us, and we have like a -- and he divided th- this, we divide like th-three quar-quarter of a -- a -- of a cup, you know, for th -- each person for the whole day. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And my parents didn’t drank -- didn’t drink, they gave us this water because we were s-so sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And then from this <span class="NPIP">place</span> after -- some people left because they couldn’t take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">They said they -- they -- they can’t take it, they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">But the moment, you know, they -- they left out sight the -- the <span class="DLF">sewer</span> , they were killed, and from the whole group, I think we -- we -- it was like 11 people that we stayed there, and then we were -- discovered where another sewer maintenance worker, he came from the <span class="DLF">manhole</span> because the <span class="DLF">manhole</span> was leading to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that we were sitting and we had to run from this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">We run from this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and we -- we met- Socha was coming to -- with the food and he saw us running and he took us to a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And we changed the <span class="NPIP">places</span> few times because it was -- some of them were so cold and so terrible that we couldn’t s-stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And finally we -- we-we wind up in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that when w- we crawl in, Socha ask my mother, “What do you think Mrs. Heger, what do you think about this <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And my mother said, “Oh, Mr. Socha, this is a <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And this is -- there in this <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> , we stay to the end, to the el-el-el-el-liberation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">QUESTION:  Can you describe then what that looked like a little bit more?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">ANSWER:  I-I-I-It -- it -- it was a branch o-of -- one of the branches o-of the <span class="DLF">sewer</span> , but relatively 1-1t was high because -- we could stand, we children would stand up, but my parents couldn’t stand up, they have to bend. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">That’s meaning it was probably like five feet high and the width was maybe five or six feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And it -- it was a main one and it had -- from this main <span class="ENV_FEATURES">branch</span> it was a -- like L sha -- it was like a L shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">It was <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to another <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> that was more or less the same s-size, and th-this is ho-how it -- it looked like, but comparing to the other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , it really looked like a <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="713">ANSWER:  This -- this was a side one. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">It didn’t have a sewage flowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">It has only <span class="DLF">manhole</span> that came -- that the raining water was coming, but not the -- the sewage wa-wasn’t there. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">It was mud -- muddy -- lot of [indecipherable] and a lot of -- lot of -- no -- rats. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="831">ANSWER:  Yeah, it was a-after I think that we stayed there almost a year, only be -- a little bit less. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">We -- we runned out -- ou-out of money, we -- we-we had some jewelry with us that my father was giving him, but we run out of this too. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And then my father re-remembered that his aunt, o-or -- told -- told him-- a aunt -- I think aunt, that she hid some money in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> of her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that she used to live, and th -- sh-she tol-told this to my father, and my father m-made the plan, he wrote on piece of paper, he designed the plan of the -- the -- he remembered th-the -- the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> and he told Socha to go there and ma-maybe he can dig and he can find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And Socha went there together with ro -- Wrobleski and they said that they are from sewer working, that is some kind of gas leak or something, and they we-were digging and they found th-the jewelry. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And he -- he -- and the next da-day, we ha -- I remember Socha came, and he -- he -- he -- he had the jewelry and he give this to -- to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And he said, Mr. Heger, you will give me yi -- like usually, every day little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And this is how it happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Every day my father used to give him, like before, certain amount of jewelry or money, and he was taking this in, probably, or selling or -- and then buying a food for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="839">QUESTION:  And -- and so, right, a lot of money was used not for Socha to get rich necessarily, but to -- to buy the food and the items that you needed, right?</span></p>
