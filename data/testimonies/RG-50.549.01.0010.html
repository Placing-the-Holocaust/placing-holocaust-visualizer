QUESTION:  Okay, this interview is to cover really events after the war, so it's, do you remember when the war ended, do you remember hearing about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  Oh, I do remember, yes I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">People were returning from, the survivors, the underground people and whoever survived was returning and the villagers were happily greeting them, the band was playing and everybody was expecting somebody, so did I. So I do remember that day, I waited that my parents might return. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I knew they were dead, but somehow, somehow I thought that it was possible, so that was the day of liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Of course they never returned, they were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">That's how I remember the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  Did somebody say to you today is the end?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  Nobody really talked much to me, I mean that's not how the villagers behave and most of the people didn't treat me like I was their equal, I was the, I was the rotten and the people who adopted me, I mean, they were hard-working people and they were not affectionate or into psychology or explaining, you know, no one explained anything to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  Where was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  That was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  Nameâ€™?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  Alshanka(ph), it's not on the map, it was very small <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  If we were to look on the map, where, that is a larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> would <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alshanka(ph</span> ) be near?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Oh, the larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> 's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin(ph</span> ), that's the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">My father chose this <span class="REGION">area</span> for hiding because it was extremely remote, had no <span class="DLF">roads</span> , no lights, no <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , no Edwarda Rorat 3 February 25, 1996 Page 3 <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> , no civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  How old were you when you started to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alshanka(ph</span> )?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  When my parents were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I'm really not very clear about my age, we had no documents, we had nothing, but when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alshanka(ph</span> ), I was a few years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I don't exactly know, a few years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I know when they were killed I was seven.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  But still you waited for them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  Yes, it's very strange what, I don't understand psychologically, yes I waited for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I mean, strange things remind us. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">First I waited for them, knowing when they were dead and I also knew the circumstances of their death, but then for the rest of my adult life, not for the rest, until twenty something, I completely eliminated the thought of them ever being there, like I eliminated the fact that I had parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I don't understand it, maybe that was the way of surviving the trauma.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  I need you to help clarify some chronology for me, because I'm a little confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">You were born Kleinfeldt(ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  Then when your parents put you into hiding, was it that time that you were adopted by another family ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  Oh no, no, no, after my parents were killed, I was not immediately taken by those people who eventually adopted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I was with the first, probably two years, with some people who were very cruel and very mean to me, so I don't even like talking about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Rorat are the Edwarda Rorat 4 February 25, 1996 Page 4 people who later took me, when I was almost dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So the first family, I did not mention, the second family is Rorat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Okay, so the war ended, people are in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , there's a band playing, you're waiting for your parents, did you consciously know at that time, did you have information that they were dead?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Because you saw it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Well, like I could hear the sound of the guns and I, on some subconscious level, knew that they were my parents because I had reactions, I suddenly couldn't walk, so that was unusual for a child a few years old, so that was immediate reaction to this, yeah, I knew they were not there any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  So we're at that day, you're standing and waiting for them to come, do you remember what you were wearing, do you remember what it looked like that day, what it smelled like that day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  This 1s after the war, you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, do you remember that day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  No, I only remember that the band was playing and everybody was happy, greeting whoever returned and I waited until the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> already left and I was still waiting and I was very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I actually forgot that moment, it just came to me recently, during some activities, that also the band was playing and suddenly the moment came to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Usually Edwarda Rorat ) February 25, 1996 Page 5 when I talk about those things I feel like my larynx 1s opposing me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  Do you remember what the band was playing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Something like marches, something of the sort.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  Were people singing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  Oh, I am sure, yes, it was sort of a happy moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Were you by yourself or were you with other people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  By myself, the usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">The other people did not really associate with me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  You were alone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  Yes, I was usually alone after my parents death.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  So you were a 10 year old, standing there alone, with all these people celebrating?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  Let's see, 10? </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Probably not 10 yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">But I don't know if you understand what being Jewish was, I mean, that was something like being a cockroach or something, I don't know what to compare it to. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">These people are very anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So no, I was usually alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">That was nothing different.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  How long did you wait there with everybody?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  Probably a few hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  Then what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  And then I went back to my usual, being in the <span class="DLF">farm</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  So tell me what, the war is over, you're no longer. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  In hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Yes, no more in hiding and I was this family, old, sick, uneducated people who Edwarda Rorat 6 February 25, 1996 Page 6 saved my life and who are poor, who work hard, and I also work hard with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I know that to, I mean it was clear that to win her approval was to work, efficiently and I was needed, they were poor people, so I was always working and no playing, really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  What kind of work did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  Oh, in the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , taking care of their cow and finding a <span class="DLF">pasture</span> for the cow, because they did not have <span class="REGION">land</span> of their own, so I spent lots of time with the cow alone in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And being eight and later nine or so, preparing food for them when the worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I had to stand on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stool</span> to reach the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , I was very small and I stopped growing. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So I cooked for them, I cleaned, took care of the little tiny <span class="BUILDING">store</span> they had, the <span class="BUILDING">grocery</span> , so thats type of work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  At that time, were you aware of what it meant, that the war was over? </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Did you know that you were no longer in hiding from that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I didn't see any Germans any more and I didn't hide any more, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  What did that feel like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  It felt much safer, but I pretty much, I was pretty much used to danger already. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I mean each time I saw Germans, I knew this meant a possible death for me, or possible for the people who are saving me, but my life was always in danger, a peasant could kill me, I understood that being Jewish was the worst thing on earth, so I was pretty much used to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  So when you no longer had to feel that way and had to feel like you had to hide who you were, did that open something in you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  I really don't know, because I don't think I knew how to be happy, how to celebrate Edwarda Rorat 7 February 25, 1996 Page 7 something. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I still was pretty, on the same level, serious-looking kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I didn't cry, but I didn't laugh either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  So you didn't go out to the cow and say to the cow, look we're free, let's run off together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Probably not. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I really didn't, I don't remember being really a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">As far as being a child I only know that I cuddled the cow. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">That was like feeling she was my mother, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">But otherwise being pretty serious.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  Even when you had the chance to lighten up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  I don't really remember moments like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">That's why I don't exactly know how to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I was in some retreat, can I digress now? </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I was in some retreat, people obviously with psychological problem go there and the game was to play like little children. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">The instruction was go on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and play like little children and for a moment I said, I wanted to leave the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and they said, where are you going, and I said, I don't know how to play, I really mean it, so I don't want to spoil it to other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So there, I know it is the grown up on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> on their fours and they were hilarious, how they start playing with pillows, with pulling each other, pushing, falling and all sorts of funny things, it didn't occur to me, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">No, I don't remember being a child like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Did I express it? </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I also never had toys. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So that was on the same retreat, that there was some sharing and questions were asked, a little similar, like you asking those details and they ask, the idea was to get back to your childhood, so everybody was sharing how their <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> looked like when they were children, what kind of toys they had, the color of their clothes, lamp, whatever was there and Edwarda Rorat 8 February 25, 1996 Page 8 I was just listening, and I didn't want to share but they really ask me to, so then I say, sorry, but I never had toys, I slept in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> or somewhere else outdoor, I had no toys. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And I was that a few months later, my birthday, big teddy bear arrived, it's over there, you didn't see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Somebody from the group, I don't know how she found my birthday and my address and said, this is fun, you can still have toys. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So that's about toys.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Do you play with the teddy bear?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Not really, because I'm not accustomed to playing with any, I never had toys, so there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  A lot of adults have toys.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  I know, I know, but that's something that one got used to at a certain time and it continues, I never got used to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I could still pick the teddy bears, but somehow I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We're talking about playing right, yeah, so that's about playing, not really much into playing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  You said you didn't have friends then either, after liberation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  There was a neighbor girl I remember, about my age, but I didn't have time to play, because they needed me and I never wanted to disappoint the people who took care of me and they were the poorest really, practically, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , so no, so I really didn't play, I was needed, I needed to help her around the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  At the time of liberation, after the war then, was there any effort on your behalf or on someone else's behalf for you to leave that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> or that family and identify yourself as a Jew again, different  â€”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  Yes, such opportunity did come. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">There were people, Jews with organizations that were Edwarda Rorat 9 February 25, 1996 Page 9 taking children and they wanted to take me, but I was so much attached already to these people and I already was becoming anti-Semitic myself, that I did not have desire to leave them, actually I didn't want to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  What were these people's names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Rorat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  Oh, these were the Rorats?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  Yes, the first family, we didn't talk about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Did they formerly adopt you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Rorat, that's how my name became.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  When that happened, did you decide at that point you were no longer a Kleinfeldt(ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  Actually I was no longer Kleinfeldt(ph) during the war, they changed my name to disguise the Jewishness, so I had some other name, Alshevska(ph), it was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , so they gave it to me, so I was no longer Kleinfeldt(ph) any way, I was Alshevska(ph), just any name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  So when you were a kid and at that point when you didn't have to hide any more, what was your identity, who did you think you were, who were you for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  This was difficult, but I don't think I had time, or thought much about it, I mean, with the first family, my only occupation was to keep alive and somehow withstand the abuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">With this family I wanted to be helpful, so I was either working, doing something with them, and then I started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , so my life was pretty busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I don't think I thought much about Edwarda Rorat 10 February 25, 1996 Page 10 my identity or anything and most likely I tried to block my past, most likely because I did realize sometime later on, that I eliminated my parents entirely, so most likely I also try not to think of anything much. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I don't know what a child does. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Maybe this is survival methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  Did you identify with being Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  Well the people reminded me of this every moment of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Not only that I'm Jewish, but that I'm scabby Jewish, it doesn't translate exactly into English, does it? </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Scabby, lousy, rotten, dirty Jew, all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So yes, I did know I was different, I was Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  So at the point that you didn't have to hide this any more, was that at least a feeling for you of, like the equivalent of coming out, of saying okay, yes I'm a Jew and yes that's fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  No, I never thought was fine, because nobody else thought it was fine and I did not think it was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I actually felt very inferior, very ugly, very inferior.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  You were saying that there were efforts made after the war, on different Jewish organizations, what was going on that you were aware of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Well, I had my sister, not with me, but she was already with Jewish people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , which is the bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and she wrote me that we have an opportunity to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and possibly go to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but I was separated with my sister, we were not close and now her asking me to join her wasn't, 1t wasn't, I don't know, it didn't mean as much to me as being with this woman who was taking care of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I didn't want to hurt her feelings and somehow I was not very much concerned with my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I knew that she will do all night, she was older than I, stronger and everything and maybe their methods were not the best, the Edwarda Rorat 11 February 25, 1996 Page 11 people who came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to talk me into leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , leaving my adoptive parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">They didn't talk to me, I mean, they tried to kidnap me because they knew I don't want to leave, so they either tried to kidnap, or if they contacted me they were saying the worst things about the villagers, so that didn't play with me, so no, so that's why I didn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I didn't leave them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  How long did you stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  I mean, in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> 13, 14, but later there were no more <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , even to that age, I have to walk several miles to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , there was no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in that little <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but at 14 there was not even enough <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the next, I don't know how you call it, next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and so I had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> and then I them very early, so that I was with them until the age of 14 and later only occasionally for the next number of years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  Okay, so essentially you came to adolescence after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  You matured after the war, you were a kid before that?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  You said that you went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , can you just tell me what kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> it was, what you would do every day? </span><span class="sentence" id="172">You'd get up, you'd say hello to the cow, you'd
ANSWER:  I usually, I mean I started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where we lived, that was during the war and that was pretty traumatic to me because the teacher was Ukrainian and he was, I Edwarda Rorat 12 February 25, 1996 Page 12 was the only Jewish kid in the class and he hated my guts. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">He absolutely couldn't stand me. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">He was a cruel person altogether, he used to beat up the other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">But I was so good in learning, in behaving, in everything, that he'd no excuse to hit me, there was no excuse and he absolutely couldn't stand a Jewess, so he continuously used to just call me something, it was Sarcastic, it was unpleasant and eventually he did hit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And that was the time I could not be hit any more, that was sort of a saturation point in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I said I will not go to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> again, that's why I had to march several miles to another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , rather than going to this one. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So it was pretty difficult for a few years old child to go through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , not a single person there. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I had to leave early, before sunrise, I mean it was dark and go by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">There were wild animals around and walk, so I wasn't easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And then after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the same thing, walking several miles by myself, but the good thought was that studying always came very easy to me compared to the other children that it did feel good to be a good student and my adoptive parents were very proud of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">But that again, it really, nothing was ever simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">When I was too good there, the children were jealous and they also could call me, oh she's so good because she's Jewish and almost being the best student was almost like an insult that that's because Jews, you know, they are so manipulative and so shrewd and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">They turn itin __. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">The teachers like me, but the children were not on my side when I was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  Did their parents ever try and get you out of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  Oh no, no, they were very, very conscious of education, even though they were illiterate, Edwarda Rorat 13 February 25, 1996 Page 13 they felt I have to be educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">They believe in that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">QUESTION:  What about the parents of the other children, was there any resentment by them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">ANSWER:  I really don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">The other children had hard time learning. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I suppose because of my background I had it easier, my parents were educated and that probably was in my genes. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So I had it real easy, I was delayed with my schooling because of the war and the way I was catching up, I was practically flying through those classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So that's why I could finish really on time, otherwise it wouldn't have been possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  I want you to help me get a picture, and actual, so I can make a little movie and describe, what kinds of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , did you walk through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , was it dense, was it dark, were they <span class="ENV_FEATURES">poplar trees</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Take me there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">ANSWER:  Okay, I'm leaving the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> when it's still dark and walking through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> of wheat and potatoes and probably mostly wheats and you know, the wheats the bread is made of and nothing else, no <span class="DLF">roads</span> , just tiny separation between the, tiny <span class="DLF">roads</span> like only for walking, the <span class="DLF">roads</span> that people made walking to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , so it's not really a <span class="DLF">road</span> , is a <span class="DLF">passage</span> , that's what you call it, it's a <span class="DLF">passage</span> , most of the people in summer were bare feet, so did I, so in summer bare feet actually, I had no shoes and in winter I wore some shoes but the tiny walk, I mean you couldn't even see from distance, tiny <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Not even enough for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , just for walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">So part of this are wheats, <span class="DLF">potato fields</span> and part of this just <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , dark <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Often was the wild pigs, whatever you call and wild dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I was pretty scared of all those animals, sometimes I was so scared, I climbed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> and waited until they disappear, or Edwarda Rorat 14 February 25, 1996 Page 14 when I carry some food with me, I gave it to dogs and they ate it and then I felt safe with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And in the winter it was deep snow, sometimes up to my shoulders or more, I have to part the snow with my arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">In summer it was not too bad, I walked bare feet and I loved the blue sky and lots of poppies, you know the red flowers? </span><span class="sentence" id="205">They grow there in abundance in <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And the birds were singing so I think this is my love of nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Did I describe my walks?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  Sounds like a really nice part of your day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  That was after the war of course, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">QUESTION:  And then you would get to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , what did the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> look like, was it a wooden <span class="BUILDING">building</span> or what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">ANSWER:  Yeah, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , when I walked several miles to this other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , this was already better <span class="NPIP">place</span> than my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">It was a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , nothing really special. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I particularly like classes of religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">The priest was giving them and he was teaching of all those miracles that happen in Catholic religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Of course I was educated and brought up actually in Catholic experience, so I was learning this. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Of all the miracles that happen in Catholicism and I suppose this was pleasant to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Maybe I thought that miracles will happen to me too, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And I was reading all the books on the subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">So actually this is my most pleasant thought, the priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">He was not anti-Semitic, at least didn't let me feel it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  Did you feel any conflict between, being brought up as a Jew that you were not to Edwarda Rorat 15 February 25, 1996 Page 15 worship idols in Catholicism with it's love of idols?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  A conflict within myself? </span><span class="sentence" id="223">No, I was very curious to learn this Catholic religion, it was very soothing to me, I like the miracles and as I told to you, I eliminated the thought of my parents from my mind and I did not remember if my parents were religious or not, I don't remember any of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So I was trying to learn what I was taught.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">QUESTION:  Did you pray for a miracle?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  I sort of did, yes, I remember at one time I was such a good girl that it was my way to be loved by these people and I was so much in a hurry to prepare for them the meal when they were returning from working hard in the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I wanted to cook for them and I lost the key and I thought, if I don't find that key, how will I cook for them, that thought was unbearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I just didn't know what to do, that I behaved in such a way that I win them. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I don't know if I prayed for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I really don't remember praying, don't forget that I was brought up Catholic and then I was educated in my very sensitive years as a Communist, so when I think of it now, it all get little blurred and confused and then I came to this Capitalistic country and became a doctor, so altogether nothing goes together really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">QUESTION:  Okay, you're in this <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> , you're praying for a miracle of the finding of the key. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">The key gets found, you know there's some validity to this thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">But I really don't, I must tell you I don't dwell much on my past life. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Actually I pretty much avoided talking about myself altogether, so by not talking about it I guess I don't remember how I, did I pray? </span><span class="sentence" id="236">No, all I wanted, not to be called a dirty, lousy Edwarda Rorat 16 February 25, 1996 Page 16 Jewess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">QUESTION:  Did that happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Did people stop calling you that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">ANSWER:  Well, I was moving on to better <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , then eventually went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , so no, yeah, they did stop calling me openly that, that changed, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  How many people lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> that you were 1n?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">ANSWER:  Even that hard for me to tell now, maybe 50? </span><span class="sentence" id="242">It was a very small <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they had their children and so on, but it was very tiny <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">QUESTION:  So were they individual <span class="DLF">farms</span> that were spread out or?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  And these were <span class="DLF">dairy farms</span> , primarily?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  It was individual farming no <span class="DLF">farms</span> , like my family had only one cow and that was actually just for their survival, not for selling. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">They were very poor people, the only one richer man was the one that initially took me. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">The one who was killing Jews and I was, really a nightmare to think about. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So he was the richer one yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  And then a nicer family took you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">ANSWER:  The Rorats, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  How did that come to be?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  You want me to talk about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  It seems that this 1s very important for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">ANSWER:  The first family who took me right after my parents were killed, they were forced to take Edwarda Rorat 17 February 25, 1996 Page 17 me, this was the order from superior, from another, that's a different story still. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">But he and his daughter who mostly, whom I mostly remember as the worst person on earth, hated me with passion, and all my complexes really I think, date from that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Her name was Wanda. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">She was very unattractive and they called her spinster those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And most of the time I spent with her, they asked me to do the work of adult person, like bringing water from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> uphill, carrying it, I was this skinny, undernourished, seven year old kid carrying water, I spilled it most often, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Washed dishes, and taking care of cows, cleaning and they didn't even give me food, I remember eating the water where you wash the dishes, I found out this â€”_, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">So the water that the dishes and pots were washed, that's what I was eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I had no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to sleep, I slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and very soon I was infested with the lice and fleas and any possible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Mostly lice, they were crawling all over me, so yeah, I was covered with scabs and I was ugly and skinny and everything and she was very cruel. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">She always threatened me with the knife and I do have many knife scars from her, that was the way to talk to the Jewess was the knife poking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">QUESTION:  You have scars now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  Mm-hm, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">QUESTION:  That are visible?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">ANSWER:  Yeah, they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">QUESTION:  May I see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Let's see, you want more light? </span><span class="sentence" id="272">mangled this finger once, Edwarda Rorat 18 February 25, 1996 Page 18 almost came off, by the knife, you can see the scar go around. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">It healed, it healed beautifully, I remember holding it together, otherwise the tip of the finger would have come off. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Practically , It did heal nicely, though. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">the knife you can see, there, protecting myself, practically each one. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Let' see, where is it, it's my, part of the hand practically came off. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And also the way she talks, I think most of those complexes are from there, this was one _. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">She also told me that my lies will drown me in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , and I believed is I had such a big lies, so she thought they will just pull me and drown me and then I was so scared, became so scared of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> that I don't swim to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And altogether she was telling me that I should go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> like all those ugly Jews who are walking, we saw them going through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and she said I should be going with them and I should die. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I mean all this, this was the worst period of my life and so you ask how the other people took me. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">After, I don't know if it was year or year and half or two, I'm not clear, that I became very sick and couldn't even walk so she just kicked me out and I was outside of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I couldn't walk, couldn't get up and the other family find out that the Jewess, that's how they referred to me, 1s dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And she decided to take me, I don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">The Germans killed her son, maybe that's the reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So that's when these people, Rorat, took me and helped me to recover. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">That's shortly speaking, what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">QUESTION:  When I watched the video tape before, they rescued you from being attacked by geese, 1s that right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">ANSWER:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Yes, yeah I'm still afraid of geese. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Yeah, you know I stopped growing after. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I Edwarda Rorat 19 February 25, 1996 Page 19 actually was not growing until the age of 18 so this was a time I was very small and skinny, almost retarded in growth, fortunately only in physical growth, so even geese attacked me when I was walking through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and they were, I mean, so loud and so aggressive with their wings hitting me and they make noises. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So I don't think that's so unusual, but the unusual thing is that he, I recall later Mr. Rorat was telling to Mrs. Rorat, you know, there were about 20 geese on top of her, hitting her and biting, and that noise and after I scared them all her face was dry, not even one tear. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">So they find it very strange and I find it strange too, but I knew, I mean I do remember I never cry, there was no, why to cry, there was no one to dry my tears, so I didn't cry and I didn't laugh either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">QUESTION:  When did you start crying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  I remember crying, yes, I remember crying, I think I was already in and I must have been 17 or 18 year old and I saw a Russian movie and I do distinctly remember the movie was about a boy who lost his parents and all his life, he didn't really lose it, somehow he was separated or whatever and the whole movie was about how much he wanted to meet his wife, not wife, his mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">He dreamed about her, he was obsessed how he would like to see his mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I don't remember circumstances that he was separated and at the end of the movie he finds his mother and this is so rejoiceful for him, he's so happy and the reason I am telling about it, this is the first time I cry, I remember that I was trying to stop myself from crying, it was in the movie and I tried so hard that I had laryngeal swelling after I came from the movie, I could not speak at all for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">It was so powerful to me Edwarda Rorat 20 February 25, 1996 Page 20 that he did find his mother, I obviously identify with it, how much I would like to have mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">So I think this was the first time I cry, probably 18 years of age. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And then later I learned that, I learned crying yeah, it's pretty nice to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I only cry when I talk about my past, these days and since I rarely talk about myself, about the past, I rarely cry, unless situation like speaking with you on the subject or on some psychologically oriented retreats that I started frequenting, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">QUESTION:  When did you start doing that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">ANSWER:  Like probably like 10 years ago or so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">QUESTION:  What caused you to, at that point, do this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">ANSWER:  Excuse me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">QUESTION:  Why 10 years ago, what prompted you 10 years ago to start?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">ANSWER:  I don't know, I mean maybe I was going through some sort of, I wouldn't call it crisis, but maybe aging, so I became interested in Eastern philosophy. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I said that's the only one missing, let's see, I was born Jewish, I was brought up Catholic, educated Communist, then came to this <span class="REGION">Capitalistic country</span> , so somehow eastern philosophy was needed to bring me back to some sort of tranquillity I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So that's the retreat I found, which was run by the guru.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">QUESTION:  ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">ANSWER:  His name was Guru , that's in <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> and I have been going there for several years, I don't any more, I don't get attached to anything in my life, that's Edwarda Rorat 21 February 25, 1996 Page 21 another, do you know about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Did I talk about this or not? </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Yeah, I cannot have relationships, I cannot get attached to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I just keep moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Going on somewhere, or always running away from, so I don't go to that retreat any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">QUESTION:  But it let you cry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">ANSWER:  Yeah, oh in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> I cried, yes, they encourage that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">QUESTION:  So now you don't cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Then you were crying.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  I do with you, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">QUESTION:  You don't want any other reasons for crying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">ANSWER:  One could cry when one is happy, I suppose.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">QUESTION:  Do you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">ANSWER:  Probably not, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">The tears only go when I talk about my past.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">QUESTION:  What about in the movies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">ANSWER:  No, because I'm very well controlled and since there are other people in the movies, I wouldn't allow myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I am very good at controlling myself, I'm very good at denying myself anything that I feel I should. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Let's see what else I'm good at. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Not getting attached to anyone, whom I like 1n particular.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">QUESTION:  Why is that good?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">ANSWER:  I don't know if it's good, but I do not get attached, so I don't get hurt that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Maybe that's the explanation. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">So I do not stay in relationship, I don't stay in anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">That's what I just mentioned about the retreat, it was wonderful to me and it had to end, like Edwarda Rorat 22 February 25, 1996 Page 22 everything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">QUESTION:  How long have you lived in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">ANSWER:  Well that's the stable place, I live here since I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in 1960. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I always thought that I will move somewhere that somehow, I don't know, I don't really plan my life, I just go with the flow, so nothing happens, I'm here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">QUESTION:  Well, let's go backwards then again, we'll go to rewind, because we, you said you were, you know you were born Jewish, raised Catholic, then became a Communist, we haven't gotten there yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">ANSWER:  Educated Communist, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">QUESTION:  So we haven't gotten there yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  Sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">My life is very long and very complicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">QUESTION:  Come on, you're not so old, so. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Okay, so we're still back, it's after liberation, you're going to the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> , you like the priest because you can pray and there are miracles and you find a key and this validates that there are miracles. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Until when did you stay in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> going to the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="348">QUESTION:  And then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">ANSWER:  Then I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , which is big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and again my, Rorat put me in <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">They were Catholics and I was the only Jewish person in this <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> and that was a Edwarda Rorat 23 February 25, 1996 Page 23 <span class="BUILDING">private Catholic school</span> , we had no penny to pay for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  How did you pay for it then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">ANSWER:  This 1s, this is, really, this moment I also recall by being in this retreat, they had those different eastern tricks, I shouldn't call it that way, that you meditate and sort of empty your mind and that's why the memories might come and that's how it happened, that this moment came to me, that I did know I have to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because I would not disappoint my foster parents and I don't know how she was planning to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">We did need the money, so here I'm in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I don't know how it came to me that I had this courage, determination or what, I went to the, I went to see the, how do you call the person who's really in charge of the whole <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the principal, principal. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And I do remember entering his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , since I was very tiny, as I told you I wasn't growing. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I remember his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> seemed so huge that when I think of his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> it almost seems like a <span class="BUILDING">skyscraper</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to me now, it was so huge and since I was so small I only could see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> , I couldn't even see his face, he was sitting behind it and he must have a hard time seeing me also, because I remember he stood up from his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and looked down at me and ask what I want, I mean probably children never go to see principal, I somehow made my way to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and there I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">So he ask what I want and I told him I need to be in this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I have to get the education, but my foster parents have no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">He said, but this is <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> and I said I really don't know what I can do but I don't have money and I suppose he must have been touched somehow that he allowed me to stay in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , not only stay in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but also in the Edwarda Rorat 24 February 25, 1996 Page 24 <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> , which was also private and need to be paid and that was also without money. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">So that, that's just that. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I have moments in my life that are difficult to explain, he is one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Also the way, why I wasn't killed, that's another difficult moment to explain. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So there. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">So I went for two years without paying a penny, to this <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> , yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">QUESTION:  Were you also good in that, a good student there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">ANSWER:  Yes, excellent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">QUESTION:  What subjects were you really good at?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">ANSWER:  In everything, in everything, you know, this was my way to, I know this was my way to win the approval, the same, anything I do, I work very hard to win approval and I knew that teachers like you very much if you learn what they were teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I study hard and I was always best in class so the teachers love me, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">That was my <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I have some sad thoughts from this, however. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I could see my difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">This was <span class="BUILDING">private Catholic school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">The children were sort of well off, nicely dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">They were receiving visitors, their families and I never had visitors, it was too expensive and too long trip for my foster parents to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">So I had no visitors, I had no nice clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">So I guess I was, started understanding a little more so this was rather sad for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">That's my Lublin Catholic years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">QUESTION:  You still seem sad to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  Because we talking about my past.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  But even when you talk about the present and not having attachments that sounds sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Edwarda Rorat 25 February 25, 1996 Page 25

<p><span class="sentence" id="385">ANSWER:  Oh, I don't wonder about the Communists are we ready for the Communist period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">QUESTION:  We're ready for the Communists, we're ready for any period you're ready for.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">ANSWER:  Well, so the next, when I was probably 16, I suddenly was in the <span class="BUILDING">Communist school</span> in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="388">QUESTION:  Hold it, hold it, we haven't gotten there, we're still, you haven't graduated from this. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="389">ANSWER:  Two years, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I didn't graduate but the opportunity arrived to go to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">QUESTION:  Okay, while you were in the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> . . .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="393">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> and living in the <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> and this whole thing, who did you tell other kids you were, I'm sure, kids always ask each other about themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, they knew, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where I was, nobody asked the question, they look and you knew, they immediately knew I was Jewish, I looked different. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I have brown eyes, brown, curly hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">All the Catholics over there have blue eyes and blonde, straight hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">There was no question, they all knew I was Jewish and orphaned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">QUESTION:  How did they treat you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">ANSWER:  By this time I think sort of better, but I was so much poorer, I didn't dress the way they Edwarda Rorat 26 February 25, 1996 Page 26 were. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I think they had their own cliques.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">QUESTION:  Did you have friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  I don't really remember, because this was such a different environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">No, I don't, yeah actually I did, now that I recall, yes I was friendly with one girl, she was crippled, she walked with the, what do you call it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">QUESTION:  Crutches?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">ANSWER:  Crutches, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So yes I was friends with her, she had a very nice family. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I don't remember why she was crippled. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I think something congenital. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Yes, so I was friends with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">So you ready for the Communist?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  I'm interested what it was like to have a friend, friendly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  Honestly it was much nicer, but I wasn't really like everybody else, I learned to be secretive, I had to be secretive during the war, not to talk about myself, be extremely careful, that I am now one of the farmer's children, had to pretend to strangers and of course if German would come to <span class="BUILDING">class</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">That I became, I just was secretive. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">You cannot be that friendly when you're closed in and I suppose that's where my custom is, from those years that I ask other people to talk about themselves and I do not talk about me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">QUESTION:  But it was a time, it was after the end of the war, you didn't have to be secretive any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">ANSWER:  Yes, but this became a custom, this became me, not to trust, not to say something that I shouldn't have say. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And this perpetuates.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">QUESTION:  Okay, the Communists came along. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Well tell me how you went from the one <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to Edwarda Rorat 27 February 25, 1996 Page 27 the next, what happened there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">ANSWER:  I mean the way it happened 1s that, in this part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , this is closer to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , I suppose there was not much iodine and my thyroid started growing. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">That's all what I needed, having these things growing in front of me and the doctor in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> said, I have to be near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , that's the <span class="REGION">Baltic Sea</span> , Polish, that's the north and there was no way I could afford to go anywhere, any <span class="NPIP">place</span> and strangely enough, this was the time I received letter from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettin</span> , which is near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Baltic Sea</span> , the north, from some very distant cousin from my real parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Distant cousin, though. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">She survived the war and found out that I was alive and that's what they did, she wrote me a letter, would I like to visit her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettin</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="424">So, to make long story short, I did take a long trip by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> across <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettin</span> , with a little trepidation because I knew she was Jewish and I had very strange feelings about the Jewish people by now. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I acquire anti-Semitism by osmosis or by whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I have never seen nice looking Jews during the war, I only saw then in hiding, with beards, smelling and wearing awful clothes and of course being reminded that being Jewish is the worst thing that can happen to anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">So I had this strange feeling so I am going to feel about meeting her. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And then I did meet her, it was nice in some way and difficult in others and her husband was a true Communist, they put me in the <span class="BUILDING">Communist school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">So from now on I was in the <span class="BUILDING">Communist school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  You said you had trepidation about meeting these people, you didn't feel good about Jews, you were anti-Semitic and so forth, so when you did meet them, what was your feeling Edwarda Rorat 28 February 25, 1996 Page 28 then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  Well they spoke Yiddish and somehow that language I find very difficult to tolerate, especially that I start having friends who are visiting me at times, and I was actually ashamed that there was Yiddish spoken around, that this is openly <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> and I saw him reading Jewish newspaper and somehow I felt aversion toward this. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I have seen during the war that the Jews that were killed had these papers with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">So this was the difficult part.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">QUESTION:  Did you feel any recognition of part of yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Also my upbringing was different, I grew up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in poverty that you can not imagine and they were older, I was by then probably 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I don't know their age, they sort of look old. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">They survived in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">So now the Communist indoctrination started in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">QUESTION:  Where was your sister during all this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">ANSWER:  My sister was in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">QUESTION:  And what happened with all the Jewish relief agencies that had been trying to get a hold of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">ANSWER:  Oh, that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> was already over with.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">QUESTION:  They gave up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">ANSWER:  Yeah, now I was with my distant cousin.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">QUESTION:  How did she find you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">ANSWER:  I don't know how she found me but she was trying to tell me that my parents were highly Edwarda Rorat 29 February 25, 1996 Page 29 educated, that I come from such a grand tradition and she, I never had enough listening about my parents, I mean, she was very distant cousin, but she did know my mother, or remember her and knew of my father and she had such wonderful manners, she was well brought up. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I was brought up by cow, I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">The way she spoke, this was someone with education and mannerism and so on, so that part I admire, she spoke beautifully and knew literature and art and times before the was, so from that is was different for me, yes, but I did miss my adopted peasants and eventually I brought them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettin</span> and I just moved, living with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">QUESTION:  You lived with the Rorats, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettin</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">ANSWER:  Yeah, I brought them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettin</span> , like all across the <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> they came and this was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that was rather overwhelming for them at first, but we lived together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">QUESTION:  What was your life like there, did you work or go to, or only go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , or...
ANSWER:  Initially I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> yes, when I lived with Barbara, that's my Jewish cousin, I had to take care of her children and there was difficult to study, you know, it's all very long, I don't want to bore you with that, but it sort of, now I was <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and there was some Jewish children too. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Jews and non-Jewish and Communist as you know, so now it should have been all right, but again I mean I was different with my background, I was still clinging to my Catholicism. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I was brought up in this poverty in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , I must have been like a wild child, so again I didn't exactly fit. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">This was the time that the girls really were noticing boys and being, playing, I didn't know how to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I didn't really have time because now again I had to win approval of Barbara, my Jewish cousin, she expected me to Edwarda Rorat 30 February 25, 1996 Page 30 return <span class="BUILDING">home</span> early to take care of her children, so with the boys, I didn't know they exist until I was about 18 I guess, so this is still before the boy... End of Tape 1 Edwarda Rorat 31 February 25, 1996 Page 31 Tape 2
ANSWER:  You see, with Communism it becomes again difficult because now I had to hide my true identity of my parents because Communist well, let me start from the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I had to be on scholarship since I had no money, I had to have some money for staying alive, so I needed scholarship and scholarship they would only give if I come from either working class or peasant class. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Farmers, if they knew where I truly come from I would get nothing, I might even be persecuted for those, these were the Stalin days, you know , yes Stalin days, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So now I have to really try to hide my true origin and this was a little difficult because now I was with my Jewish cousins, so the whole thing was so complicated I always have to pretend that I am the peasant's daughter and I didn't quite look like peasant, even though I was brought up, I mean I didn't exactly look and behave, when it's something that one inherits I suppose, the manners of a certain class I guess, so this was very, this was at times very difficult to such an extent that the members of the, you see the children are a member of the youthful Communist organization, the older of course are the true Communists, so they call me eventually and ask, well I had to explain the truth, I have to tell the truth, yes I was adopted, true I lied, I was adopted, my parents did exist, aha, but you survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">So this is suspicious, how you survived, right, the Germans had the order of killing Jews whenever they found them and children too, so here I tell the real story, I must tell you, I never learn how to lie, I'm very bad at it, so how did it happen and I had to tell them the truth, that the German came into the <span class="INT_SPACE">hiding</span> , dragged the parents, killed Edwarda Rorat 32 February 25, 1996 Page 32 them and looked at me, thought I was pretty and they didn't kill me, so that sounds too naive and too ridiculous, they didn't believe it, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="461">They didn't and something didn't work and the whole thing was so ridiculous, how could it possibly be something suspicious when I was six or seven at the time of that, how could I? </span><span class="sentence" id="462">So then I became angry because I do have my temper when I let it and I said, all night, I collaborated, and that really finish it, but they were upset with me that this was the arrogant way of me to answer and it really aggravated me so that's what I remember, that for a long time I had to hide that I am actually Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">As a peasant it was much better for me, but eventually this come out, I mean they find out my Jewish cousins, oh blah, blah, so I had to tell the truth, that I am Jewish and I was not killed, I don't know why, but it really was at times very difficult with the Communism, I had a very bad influence at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because my cousin was not Communist, her husband was, she was not and neither were my peasants, Rorat, so I had that influence at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and hear the propaganda at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , so I really, I had problems with that and then since I was the best student, I of course had to be in the forefront of the organization and everything and they ask me to report on other kids from the class, to report if they have family in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> or maybe or so, oh I have to also hide that I had sister in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> so that â€”__. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">~They were so strict that, the Communists that is, that no one should have contact with the Imperialistic, rotten, Capitalistic <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , so of course I had to keep it secret that I had sister there. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">It wasn't easy to keep all those secrets. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">So they called me once and asked me to bring the information from the class and I never learned how to lie and I did not learn how to be diplomatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">The Edwarda Rorat 33 February 25, 1996 Page 33 people who brought me up were not diplomatic, the villagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So I said no, I will not be spy. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">That was not the way to answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">If it was now I would and then I wouldn't of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Since I was so direct and so straight, I said I will not be spy, so he slapped me and I have hard time with being slapped. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I had enough of that in my past. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So there, that's the Communist years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">QUESTION:  How long were you in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">ANSWER:  For two years, until I finish, this is different system, in there it's when you finish 18, you finish the, what do you call it here, , and then after that you're ready to go to the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">So that was until the age 18 and then I went to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> and I was Communist of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">QUESTION:  Why did you go to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  It was not my decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I really did, I was not used to decide anything in my life, I mean I didn't have opportunity to decide, it was decided for me, right, when did I have a voice for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So when I finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at 18 I had no idea what I want to do, I never knew how to make any decisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">But since I was so good again in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> the teachers were saying I should go to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> because this is needed in after war <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , they had no doctors, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was, as you know, nonexistent practically, all destroyed, damaged, bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And they needed doctors, so that's what the teachers said, I should go into medicine and it's competitive, it's difficult to get in and I probably have a chance, I should. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Yeah, I do remember now, I wanted to be a teacher for some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">If I need to study I mean, then I would become a teacher, I think, or maybe veterinarian, I did love animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">But they say no Edwarda Rorat 34 February 25, 1996 Page 34 they don't need veterinarians, they have enough teachers and I should go to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">So I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I always follow what I was told and I was actually hoping that I will not pass the competitive exam. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">But I did pass competitive exam. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And then I was hoping, maybe they will not accept me because then the Communists have to approve you, if you're good or not, after I pass the competitive exam, then I have to face the board of Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And I was hoping maybe then I flunk and I almost did, almost did. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Because they ask some questions about the political system and something, it was give and take. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And I did answer truthfully, almost every, not almost, practically everybody was disappointed with Communism and so was I, but you don't say it to them, right, if you want to be admitted to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> or to anywhere, but I told the truth and they were absolutely shocked because no one who has any brain would do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I remember they were sort of bored with interviewing and here I come and they all lifted their head and I do remember they ask if it is the Communist organization that taught me that honesty. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">You see, they were, and they were sure I would say yes, that I learned this in Communist organization, but no I didn't give them the satisfaction. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I said no, I learn it from my foster parents, that I always have to be truthful and that was the end of interview and there were several other students sent in there and after we left they say, okay good-bye Edwarda, they will never take you to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , how can you answer in such a truthful way, that's not the way to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">But they were impressed with my frankness and this actually they need, they always wanted to have good students in the Communist organization and they did try to recruit somebody like me, so yeah, they did take me, in spite Edwarda Rorat 35 February 25, 1996 Page 35 of my not really wanting to. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">So I end up in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , that was next.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">QUESTION:  What was that experience like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">ANSWER:  It was very difficult for me at the beginning because the first year or so in <span class="BUILDING">Polish medical school</span> is a lot of the basic sciences and also seeing the cadavers and doing autopsy on them and I could not tolerate this. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I have seen enough cadavers in my childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">You know, the German killing, I have seen so many dead people and I had a very hard time with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">QUESTION:  What happened the first ttme you were confronted with a cadaver?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">ANSWER:  Oh for me this wasn't the first time, I had seen many before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">QUESTION:  I meant in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">ANSWER:  Yeah, I did not like that memory to come alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I didn't like it and I was hoping that I will flunk and be thrown out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION:  Well let's get to that moment, the first time you walked into a <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> , <span class="BUILDING">operating theater</span> , whatever, in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> and there's a cadaver.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">ANSWER:  Well I probably gasp. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Remember I told you, I learned to hide my emotions too well and I just had to get over this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">QUESTION:  You didn't throw up, you didn't go screaming and run out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="511">ANSWER:  Oh no, I don't do such things, no never in my life did I allow myself to scream or behave out of expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  How about when you're alone, do you allow yourself to do those things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">No, became like a robot. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Edwarda Rorat 36 February 25, 1996 Page 36
QUESTION:  You mean if I left this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> right now, you wouldn't say okay, I'm going to start screaming?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">QUESTION:  Get rid of her, I'm glad she's out of here, but ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">ANSWER:  No, no, it's such a part of me, it's so ingrained in me that I have to be accepted that I couldn't scream because the neighbors wouldn't accept it, remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I have neighbors, very acoustic <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> , no, so I couldn't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">That's from my childhood, I have to be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">QUESTION:  Okay, so we're in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Communist medical school</span> , whatever that may mean, I have no idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">ANSWER:  Yeah, well like it was very difficult to study, it's a very demanding, very demanding and I of course had to be on scholarship, otherwise I had no means of supporting myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">There were no jobs like here students can get jobs, there were no such thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">So I had to behave in the Communist organization and always have to be best student, so that's very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I had to really study, otherwise I would lose scholarship.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">QUESTION:  Is this the first time you had to actually study in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">ANSWER:  Well I actually did study before, but here yes, it was hard for me also. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And by then my sister started sending me little from here and once they saw me wearing nylon stockings and I lost scholarship and I really, well I got it back later because I had to go to the dean of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and told him, if I don't have the scholarship, then I cannot study, so Edwarda Rorat 37 February 25, 1996 Page 37 then they gave me back, but I had to still be secretive about my contact with <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And what else. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I mean they did ask me to give something back for the scholarship, I have to do something for the system. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And what I choose was to teach in lower classes, being a teacher, or teach illiterates, I was very good at that because I did teach my foster mother how to read and write, she was illiterate. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I taught her that in her old age, so I was already good at that, so I now I was teaching illiterates to give back something to the Communist system. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">So I was either teaching in <span class="BUILDING">classes</span> or teaching illiterates or going to help with the removing the bricks and ruins wherever it needs, area of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> needs to be cleaned, they didn't have enough workers, they wanted students to help and of course they want who got scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">So I would go to try to remove the bricks and all the debris that was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Or at the time of, how do you call, when the wheat is grown, when the peasants harvest, the time of harvest I would go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Also at the time when potatoes are ready, I don't know how that is called, that the farmers needed help. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">So that's what I would do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">QUESTION:  Were you politically active at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  I did what I need to do, but I was very resistant. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">So it was mostly like a social world that I did, not speeches or anything like that, I couldn't possibly do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">QUESTION:  Meetings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">ANSWER:  Meetings, yes, but I was not active in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">They always recruited me and liked to show that I am in the organization because I'm a good student, but I was not active, I could not make speeches, I didn't believe in it, so just marching in the very important holiday May Ist. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Edwarda Rorat 38 February 25, 1996 Page 38 Marching with the red flag and wearing green shirt and red tie and of course doing the social work, that was the part of my organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">QUESTION:  During this time you said your sister had been writing you and sending you, well I don't think that was, the nylon stockings _, but...
ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah not much, a little bit, but I had to be careful with it because I had to pretend of course I had no contact with <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and my cousin's husband, Barbara in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettin</span> , he was a true Communist, not the one just did it because to survive, he was one of the very few who truly believed in it and he was really a wonderful man in a way that I mean giving, honest, ethical and not opportunist, so I really like him, but when he told me that I have to return my sister letters, that was a little hard to swallow, but then I stopped living with them, so that was under control.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION:  How did your sister get in touch with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">ANSWER:  She was writing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">QUESTION:  Yeah, but how did that come to be, how did she know how to find you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="549">ANSWER:  Oh, I didn't tell you that. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">My sister came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with the help of Jewish organizations, and that's how Barbara found her, through Jewish organizations, so actually my sister told her that I'm in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and gave her my address, that's how Barbara wrote me letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And later I suppose they did communicate with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Two of the letters were probably not just to me, maybe to Barbara also. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">So that's the Communist time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">QUESTION:  Okay, so your distant cousin's husband said you have to return the letters and then you Edwarda Rorat 39 February 25, 1996 Page 39 moved from their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to the Rorat's?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  I brought the Rorat to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettin</span> and then I lived with them, of course very modestly, we find them some little job that he was a, how do you call, he lived in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">office building</span> which closes at night and they needed a man to close the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and take care of it, it was like a superintendent of the <span class="BUILDING">office building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">That's where we lived, in a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement apartment</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> was pretty nice, so I lived with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">They had the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and some little salary.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">QUESTION:  This was in the, in what years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettin</span> , I finished <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> in '59, so this was in the fifties.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">QUESTION:  You stayed with them until you finished <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="561">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">QUESTION:  Were you happy then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">ANSWER:  Well by then we started having problems because by then obviously I was a woman and I had, we are not going into this, but toward the end of my regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I met a man who loved me to death and I did love him, but the problem was she probably would never accept anybody for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">She had a terrible marriage and she didn't believe in marriages and nobody was good enough for me and he was 10 years older and divorced and she hated his guts, so we started having problems, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">QUESTION:  This is Mrs. Rorat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  Yes, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Edwarda Rorat 40 February 25, 1996 Page 40
QUESTION:  Why did you say we're not going into this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">ANSWER:  I mean because you wouldn't want to hear beginning, how it was, what happens when I grew up, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="569">When I developed and this would be another chapter, another book maybe, so I skipped that and just told you, this is the circumstances that I did, met that man who was probably for me or maybe not. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I married him, but I never stay in relationships so I didn't stay in this one either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">QUESTION:  But I'm interested in that process of, becoming a woman is becoming aware in a very definite way, you become aware of your body, you become aware of other people's reaction to you, it changes everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">QUESTION:  And because you were older when this happened, I would think you would be more intellectually able to look at what was happening and reflect on that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">ANSWER:  I had very difficult time to become mature and all that, I wasn't prepared for this, I mean my foster parents she never talked to me about what it is to be a woman, what it is about men and I wasn't prepared for any of this, how you relate to men and don't forget, in my important years I was a Catholic, so that's against sex, sex is dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">So that was pretty tough for me, that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And it didn't much help that I was raped first time when I was a virgin, so that didn't really help in my development.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">QUESTION:  When was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">ANSWER:  I was probably, I told you I didn't develop until I was 18, and that happened, yes when I Edwarda Rorat 41 February 25, 1996 Page 41 was I think 18 or 19, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">QUESTION:  You were raped?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">ANSWER:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So that didn't help much about my concept of men and relationship and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">QUESTION:  This was in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">ANSWER:  No, it was before <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , I was on vacation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="584">QUESTION:  Did you have anyone to talk to about this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="585">ANSWER:  Not when it happened, because it happened in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="586">It was very painful, 1t was awful, unexpected, I did not feel any other actions to men yet, I was scared of them and he just jumped me, overpowered me and did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">It was painful, it was awful, it was just I think that the physical pain I always could get over, I mean pain was nothing for me, but the psychologically, psychological rape, that I do have hard time with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I wanted to kill him. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I grabbed a stone and I missed his head but it was very close to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">That was tough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">QUESTION:  Was it someone you knew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">ANSWER:  I didn't know him, he was, this was on vacation for students and he didn't belong there, he was not a student, he was older so he knew how to lure me into conversation and a walk and so on, so I really didn't know him, but I had a conversation with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">That person, I was completely unaware, men, woman, I was really, I told you, like a wild kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Anyway, that's a long time ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">QUESTION:  Yeah, but it's affected you still.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">ANSWER:  It probably did, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Edwarda Rorat 42 February 25, 1996 Page 42
QUESTION:  So we were up to this, the boyfriend.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="598">ANSWER:  Oh, what happens after this rape, no I, so that sort of again stopped me from relating to men.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="599">QUESTION:  Could you talk to your foster mother about this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">ANSWER:  No, not to her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">QUESTION:  To anyone, to your cousin?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">ANSWER:  I did to my cousin and she was very upset by this, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">I was living with Barbara at the time, this was vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Yeah, but it was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Yeah, I did talk to her and I drop out from <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , I couldn't deal with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">But I did return and made up for the lost time, so there was no delay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">QUESTION:  How long did you drop out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="608">ANSWER:  It wasn't long, I think was for maybe a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">That's a lot in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , but I did return and made up. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">So where are we?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="611">QUESTION:  The 10 years older boyfriend.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="612">ANSWER:  Oh, I see, yes, this was in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> and he was a professor already and that was the biggest love of my life, but also it was very difficult for us, I mean I come from such a screwed up life, I was not prepared for relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">He was, he had a hot temper and I don't think he was best in psychology and also he really didn't know much about me because remember, I don't talk about myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">He didn't even know that I had real parents before. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">He didn't know that and here we are intimate with, this is the person I was most intimate in my Edwarda Rorat 43 February 25, 1996 Page 43 life and eventually married to, he didn't know my past, he didn't know about me and I just didn't know anything about men, I mean it takes something to keep a relationship going. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I had no concept of it and especially that suddenly I was recognized as attractive. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I was the only one, or very few who was dark hair and dark eyes and now that I developed, oh well they start noticing me and he couldn't deal with it, he was extremely jealous over me and continuously would fight about it and I couldn't deal with him accusing me of something. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I mean I have no interest with other men and I felt he was accusing me continuously, we were having fights, we were breaking up, it was so difficult for me, because here, for the first time here, I love somebody, it's a wonderful feeling and especially the way he was loving, only Slavs know how, I mean showering with these words, with affection, with being there all the time, I can't describe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And of course I was drawn into this and then we would have terrible fights. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Somebody would look at me and he thought I looked at them too, and we just had fights so 1t was very difficult for me, it was hard to be with him and it was impossible to be without him, so there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="622">ANSWER:  Not really, or maybe, well I had to speed up with <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> because now we're coming to going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">QUESTION:  You don't have to speed up anything, but we're just trying to figure out, you were...

<p><span class="sentence" id="640">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">QUESTION:  Was it a big ceremony?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">ANSWER:  No, I never wanted to marry, so one day, you know, we did not have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , it was all very, Edwarda Rorat 45 February 25, 1996 Page 45 I mean we're still poor and here he's, I think he was associate professor, or what I am now and he was writing a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> , that was the way of moving around. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So he, one day he said let's go for a ride as we sometimes did and he took me to <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> , arrived there and he said let's get married and I said okay and I called my best woman friend from <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> to be a witness and my foster father, so there we were, we're not even specially dressed and we went to a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> for dinner after that, that was it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">QUESTION:  And your foster mother who didn't really like him, what happened then with her? </span><span class="sentence" id="645">You said your father came, but not your foster mother.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="647">QUESTION:  Did you then move in with him, did you have an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> together or something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="648">ANSWER:  This was just, I was already going, I was ready to go to <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">He did have an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and I used to spend nights there, but that was in between his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and my foster parents here and there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">QUESTION:  So you said, but you were going to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="652">QUESTION:  So how did that come to be, that you were going to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">ANSWER:  As you know, my sister was in <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> already for a long time and the new law came that, I don't know if you remember there was so called Iron Curtain that no one could leave from Communist country and come to this, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="654">It was just not, it was illegal, so suddenly the law changed that 1f somebody in the Communist country could prove that his immediate Edwarda Rorat 46 February 25, 1996 Page 46 family was in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , then they were allowed to emigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">So that changed and I received letter from my sister saying, you know law is changed now and we are the only two sisters and I would like to invite you to come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and that took many years, so that was before I met my future husband and although I had a little hard time with it, don't forget I was brainwashed against <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , this was the rotten Imperialism, the worst system in the world, corrupted. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">That's from every point of view and the way they were, just brainwashed us, showing this funny Americans, all they like to do it chew gums and what else was it, and drink Coke. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Later on Polish people are drinking Coke too, but at that time it was funny and ridiculous, chewing gum and drinking Coke, no culture or nothing and I had no interest in going to <span class="NPIP">place</span> like that you know, so my sister was a stranger. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">So I really did not have interest but my cousin Barbara and other people who were really not so devoted Communists, said don't listen to all this, you have only one sister, you should play along, you go there and if you don't like it, you come back, so that's what I started doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">QUESTION:  Okay, go back to the, starting with the visa, the passport.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">ANSWER:  Oh, I applied for this, this was very complicated, the visa, the passport, the papers, the documents and I had to travel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , that's where the officials were and I live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettin</span> , so that was, it took some time and I was just playing along, but actually was not ready to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And eventually they said they would, oh I see, Barbara said I have to finish <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , that I should not go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> before I finish and she probably was smart, Edwarda Rorat 47 February 25, 1996 Page 47 so that then it pleases me too, because I really didn't want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , so okay I'm studying, prolonging the passport, the visa, prolonging. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Apparently you can prolong it for some time, but not forever, so when I married, around the time I was going to marry my husband, my passport and my visa was not going to be prolonged any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I was prolonging so long, that I think my passport expire when I was on the trip, you know, during the trip to <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="664">So obviously couldn't prolong any more, so there, that's how the trip to <span class="COUNTRY">United State</span> came along. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">My sister paid for a trip, I thought that it was round trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">That's how I parted with my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">It was very hard for me to leave him behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I thought my heart will break, how I missed him when I came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I couldn't stand the separation. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Only later I understood that I cannot stand any separation with any person that I care for and for him this was such a deep love I felt that that separation almost killed me, I couldn't stand it, I wanted immediately to return to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but my sister would not pay the trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">She didn't have any money, neither did I. So I could not return.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="672">QUESTION:  What year was this that you left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="673">ANSWER:  December, '59.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="674">QUESTION:  '59. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Physically how did you travel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">ANSWER:  Well she paid for, was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , I was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> for I don't know how many days and I vomited full time, so I couldn't eat, it was Queen Elizabeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">It wasn't expensive, but it was Queen Elizabeth and I was every day vomiting, it was obviously emotional, I couldn't stand leaving my husband behind and going to this disgusting, rotten, Edwarda Rorat 48 February 25, 1996 Page 48 Imperialistic country where I didn't know the language, I didn't know anything about it and I was taught that these people have no hearts, no soul, no . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">That's where I was going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">QUESTION:  Did you ever think about just not getting on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">ANSWER:  I did, but you see I'm a responsible person, she paid for the trip and actually my husband was a good man, he did not want to stop me from it, he said this is maybe the only opportunity that you're going to see your sister, your only sister and everybody would like to see <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , so he said he did not want to be the one to stop me from it, he trusted that we will be united in one way or the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">QUESTION:  So you came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , you landed here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">ANSWER:  Yes, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">QUESTION:  As the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was approaching, what was going through your mind?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">ANSWER:  I was just missing my background, my culture, my husband first of all and I was curious what it would be to meet my sister, she was not waiting for me, it was her husband and he didn't speak one word of Polish and I didn't speak any English, so we could not communicate. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And then he brought me into leafy <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , long drive. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">My sister had the little baby, was busy with that, she did not want to speak Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">She had her, you see she left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> not so long after the war and she always remembered this as the anti-Semitic country where she has the memory of tragic childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">My memories of that probably healed a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there, I had my friends there, I had Rorat to love me and Edwarda Rorat 49 February 25, 1996 Page 49 this was my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and my language, but not for her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">QUESTION:  When the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was coming in, do you remember what you saw first of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">ANSWER:  Oh, those <span class="BUILDING">skyscrapers</span> and the cement and <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , I didn't like it, you remember I'm a country girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I like the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and animals and the blue sky and birds and I didn't like what I saw.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="693">QUESTION:  What time of day was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="694">ANSWER:  I think, yeah, it was a day, during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And also I vomited through the entire passage, day and night, so I must have been pretty exhausted from this. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">It was emotional for sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">QUESTION:  So you arrived expecting to see the sister you hadn't seen in how many years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">ANSWER:  Oh gosh, I think by now, let me count off the years, I'm not good at counting those. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Parted when we were eight. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">15 years or so? </span><span class="sentence" id="701">But we were never that close so I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">QUESTION:  So you meet the husband, with whom you can't communicate and you have this drive to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">ANSWER: <span class="REGION"> New Jersey</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="704">QUESTION:  Where in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">ANSWER:  I think it was called red something. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Red, I don't know, red something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">QUESTION:  You're exhausted, you're emotionally exhausted and you see her, who you haven't seen in 15 years, what was that meeting like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">ANSWER:  You see, even though I grew up without parents, without love, without emotion, still you know, we would hug or something in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , here we come, she comes and gives me this kiss in the <span class="DLF">air</span> , like, not even hug, I think I romanticized the whole thing, but she is a little Edwarda Rorat 50 February 25, 1996 Page 50 baby there. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">So it was just like I came for a weekend or something, like nothing ever happened and then she doesn't want to speak Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">She didn't have easy life here also, when she arrived and so she has her own story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">QUESTION:  Are you in touch with her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="713">QUESTION:  How about with her children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">ANSWER:  Yes, we keep, I keep in touch with them, one now lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and we are okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">QUESTION:  So there you are in a strange <span class="NPIP">place</span> , with a language you don't speak .. .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">ANSWER:  Red Bank. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">That was the name, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">QUESTION:  What happened then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">ANSWER:  We live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Red Bank</span> , it's a very small place in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , winter, she's busy with her kid, a tiny baby and I can't sleep at night, I'm missing <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , I'm missing my husband, I think my heart's going to break. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Oh, I think I cried for, we talked before that I didn't cry during these years of growing up? </span><span class="sentence" id="721">During this time I cried enough for all the years that I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I kept writing letters to him and he couldn't help me and I just decided no, I cannot be here, I really had nothing in common with my sister, nothing interested me here, I was just extremely homesick and miserable and so I decided I must go back and the only way to go back was to earn some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Where, how, all I knew, that I have a profession, although I don't speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">So the next thing is my brother-in-law is going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> because his old mother lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> and I said to him, I don't know how we Edwarda Rorat 31 February 25, 1996 Page 51 communicated but by then I was walking with dictionary and trying to learn something. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">By the way, I was not allowed to learn English, it was the Capitalistic language when I was studying, it was not allowed to study English and I wouldn't jeopardize my scholarship, so I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I learned some German, some French I knew from my parents, but no English. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">So by now I communicated a little bit with him and he agreed that I would go with him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="728">While he went to visit his mother up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> , I walk around and I see it says <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> That I knew means <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="729">In my language it's , that's similar. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">So I went to that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and walked to the superintendent and made some little conversation that I am a physician and I don't speak English, but I would like to work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And he immediately liked me, he said most of the physicians don't speak English, but none of them tells me that they don't speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">So you see my honesty sometimes win people over. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Not always, but sometimes it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">So he said, okay, I do need intern. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I didn't know what it means to be intern in the <span class="BUILDING">city hospital</span> that that was, so that's the next situation, I work in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> as an intern without speaking English, hardly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">QUESTION:  This is here in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">ANSWER: <span class="BUILDING"> City hospital</span> , working day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I was not prepared, because our <span class="BUILDING">medical schools</span> didn't function that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">After you finish <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , then you assisted to somebody, we didn't have such huge <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Here they just, you know what <span class="BUILDING">city hospitals</span> are, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="741">So that was really a shock to my system that they didn't care if the patient lives or dies. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">There was one intern for hundreds of patients and no one told me anything, practically. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I was Edwarda Rorat 52 February 25, 1996 Page 52 totally and completely lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And then I was, as you remember I went there because I want to earn money and return to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and then I found out how little they pay because I get <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">The salary was so little that it would take long time to earn that money. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Anyway I was saving everything and eventually I had enough to return to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> so I went to the superintendent and I say I want to leave and he said oh, you signed the contract, you cannot leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">At that time I didn't know I could sue, I could do, I didn't even know about lawyers existed, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> nobody sue anybody that I know of. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">I didn't have money for such things, so I had to stay longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And so on, so the time went by and I did not return.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">QUESTION:  How long were you there at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">ANSWER:  Oh, internship was one year and it was very eventful. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Can I be excused for a moment? (</span><span class="sentence" id="753">pause) .. . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , maybe I shouldn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">QUESTION:  Now I want to ask about, before I forget, when you came here, from being in an environment where you were a communist, it was, that was Joe McCarthy with the House on American Activities committee, it was an intensely Reds under the Bed time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="756">ANSWER:  '59 yes, mm-hm, but I did not have contact with any of that, somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">You mean in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="758">No, none whatsoever, on the contrary, when I was leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> I remember speaking to American Consul, it was necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And with my honesty, I mean it was already clear, I have my passport, 1t will expire soon, I'm leaving and I'm turning to him and telling him, do you realize that I belong to a youthful Communist party and he said, did I ask you any question? </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I said no, but I thought I should tell you and he said, no I didn't ask you and Edwarda Rorat 53 February 25, 1996 Page 53 I'm not interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">That was strange to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">That was American Consul, obviously they knew what it meant belonging to youthful Communist party or to any party. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Most people didn't believe in, so he didn't take it seriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And no one ever questioned me about anything here. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">In the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> all they needed was the working body, that's all they were interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">QUESTION:  So that never became an issue while you were here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="767">ANSWER:  Never.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="768">QUESTION:  And clearly your sister and her husband didn't feel that they were 1n any sort of...
ANSWER:  Yes, actually they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">He apparently had problem with his clearance because of the situation you're saying and he did work for Lockheed, which you know is, you know what that means. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">So actually I remember she or he said, soon after I arrive, at least his clearance won't be a problem any more, that I'm here, not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">But otherwise no, I never experience anything else about my background here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="772">QUESTION:  Okay, you said it was an eventful year, that first year in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="773">ANSWER:  Extremely, I mean because it was such hard work, day and night and what I learned in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> was, I mean while we stay in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> was clearly helping patients and it was almost, I mean we were indoctrinated by the patient 1s everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">It wasn't for money, there wasn't any money in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , medicine or no medicine there was no money, so it wasn't for money, it was not prestigious, anybody, everybody in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> work and since medicine didn't have any money, then somehow nobody thought much of being physician or Edwarda Rorat 54 February 25, 1996 Page 54 teacher or anything, so all those things didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">So here I am in the <span class="BUILDING">city hospital</span> and if I tell you one example you will understand my awakening to reality and different reality than I was prepared to, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Here I am working at night as I told you, unable to cope with all those patients and I'm only one, but anyway I quickly develop system that I will tend to the one who is dying and somehow the rest will take care of itself, so here it is, one patient dying, I have to give him intravenous infusion and while he's already in shock, his veins are collapse, it's difficult to find it, eventually I found the vein, the infusion is going, I'm very happy, I did what I need to do, but now I have to go to see other patients, so I told one nurse, don't do anything on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , just keep around him in case infusion is not going or when it is over, since I didn't know when I would be back, just stay by him, watch this infusion going and when it's finished, change the bottle or call me, don't do anything else, anything that I write any orders, I do myself, stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">She said all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">She was a minority nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And I went to take care of other patients and I return, I don't know after how long, maybe half an hour, maybe longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">The bottle is empty by now, the infusion is finished long time ago, by now the <span class="DLF">air</span> 1s in it, she's nowhere to be found until I open the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , she's sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and reading newspaper and smoking cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And the patient is dead of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">The infusion stopped, he was in shock, he's dead, she never changes and this infuriated me so much that I grabbed this empty bottle and I threw it at her, but I missed, I missed her head and I told her she's dismissed, she must leave the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , so she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Of course I said it with anger. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">So next day superintendent calls me, that's not the one who hire me, this was different Edwarda Rorat 95 February 25, 1996 Page 55 superintendent and he tells me I understand you insulted the nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And he said, you have to apologize to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And I said, I'm not going to. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So he said, if you don't apologize, then you are going to be fired because I have enough interns, but we don't have enough nurses. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">So that was the awakening, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="790">That was a rude awakening, he said he doesn't care that the patient died. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">It was clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Well he didn't fire me because there was opposition by other doctors that I'm such a good intern and so on, but that among other things was awakening what medicine is like and what life is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="793">QUESTION:  But if you'd been fired it would have broken your contract, you could have gotten back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ...
ANSWER:  Yes, I didn't know it would be then, I didn't think of it, 1t was just shocking, he didn't fire me, they told me I cannot leave and he didn't fire me, all right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="794">QUESTION:  It would have been a solution.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="795">ANSWER:  Yeah, it would have been but it didn't happen that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="796">QUESTION:  You said that you went into medicine without any great desire to be in medicine, to be a doctor, did that change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="797">ANSWER:  It did change, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">I didn't like the initial encounter, I told you, the cadavers and the basic sciences, but that was only the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Later we start dealing with patients and I got very much involved in it and yes, it did interest me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="800">QUESTION:  Did you see any transference, that where you had been saved, you were saving?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="801">ANSWER:  I didn't think of that, but it did give me wonderful feeling to do something for patients and Edwarda Rorat 56 February 25, 1996 Page 56 yeah, it is a wonderful feeling, no question about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="802">QUESTION:  But it wasn't that you were in some way paying back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="803">ANSWER:  No, I didn't think of it this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="804">QUESTION:  Have you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="805">ANSWER:  I tell you, I don't really reflect much on those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">It seems I was just going with the flow. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">You see, I didn't make many decisions, somebody always make them for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">That's why I feel lost sometimes now, no one makes them for me any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">So I don't make them either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="810">QUESTION:  So the year of internship 1s over?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="811">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="812">QUESTION:  You're still living with your...
ANSWER:  In the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="813">QUESTION:  Okay, in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , then what happens?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="814">ANSWER:  I mean, toward the end of this I found out somebody was helping me, a doctor, a sort of, anonymously he was helping me. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">At night he would take my night calls without me knowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Was helping me a lot instead of helping me also openly and so on, he was a Yugoslav man, a doctor there, ahead of me or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And before you know he told me he loves me. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Of course, let's see, oh I was hiding that I was married because I was brought up that every man likes to fool around with married woman, that's how it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , that was the time of virginity, so of course the virgin woman would not fool around, but married Edwarda Rorat 37 February 25, 1996 Page 57 one would, so I was hiding the fact that I was married. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And he was helping me around, this is from <span class="REGION">Slavic country</span> , familiar, we could communicate a little more in our language, which was easier for me than English and he was pretty unhappy here himself, was hard for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">So we became closer and closer, he told me he loves me and one day, before much thinking about it, we did become intimate and that was really very shocking to me, that it wasn't really that much different than with my husband, because he always told me that what we do and this is so special, it's only between us, with no other men you would ever feel that and it's only, I mean I can't say it in English, I was really, don't forget, I was a Catholic and I didn't know anything about these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">He told me this is between us and forever and here it is, it's not so much different with this man and this man is like an angel to me, helping me, he doesn't fight with me, he seems so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">So I start doubting, suddenly start doubting, I had no one to discuss these things with. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I start doubting if my relationship, which is so difficult, if it is so special. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And being really stupid, I wrote my husband that I betrayed him, that was the word, if you have sex with somebody else, that's betrayal. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">As you know, I was always straightforward and I remained that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">I didn't know I don't supposed to tell him. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">So I wrote him that and then I didn't think there was a way he could forgive me and probably he couldn't so he has really, he had the nervous breakdown at that. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I mean Polish people are different than what you know here and the time changed now, who gets a nervous breakdown over a woman now, a woman doesn't mean much, does it? </span><span class="sentence" id="829">So, he did get the nervous breakdown and then they let every postpone, he ended up in the <span class="BUILDING">institution</span> for a Edwarda Rorat 58 February 25, 1996 Page 58 short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And I thought there was no way back after what I told him, so I didn't return. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And of course, quite soon after I find out, I don't love this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">But then I never stayed in any relationship in my life and after I find out, I don't love this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">But then I never stayed in any relationship in my life, so sooner I was in with this one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="834">QUESTION:  Were you in contact with your husband after that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">ANSWER:  I was writing to him later that he absolutely should divorce me, he deserves better and I beg him to marry somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I really meant it, I feel very guilty, I feel very bad and eventually he did marry someone who looks just like me. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">So I don't know, that's that part.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="838">QUESTION:  But you didn't marry again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="839">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="840">QUESTION:  Okay, so this guy you weren't in love with, the Yugoslavian guy, you're out of the internship, what are you doing for work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="841">ANSWER:  Then you become resident and since I don't like making many, I mean I still didn't know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , I was working the day and night so I thought this was the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , the only <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and I apply for residency and they didn't take me because that was that super that I insulted the nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">As I understand now, she went to the union, you know, they had problems on, so he didn't want me as a resident and that's just wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">This was one of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> that later became the worst, the absolute worst, 1t wasn't then yet, then, so I had to look for another one and that man friend, the Yugoslav helped me to find another, which was much nicer and I had to take exams, I need time to study, so I couldn't select any Edwarda Rorat 59 February 25, 1996 Page 59 specialty, I need to select specialty that I could study at night, not work at night and that's how I end up in pathology, which I am now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="844">QUESTION:  Just by accident?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="845">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="846">QUESTION:  That's like most things for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="847">ANSWER:  Yes, because I don't decide.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="848">QUESTION:  So you did your residency in pathology?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="849">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="850">QUESTION:  Where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="851">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Queens</span> , which the was nice and light for me, there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , there was a <span class="DLF">park</span> around, with green, not like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> , I hated this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="852">You know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettin</span> is a beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , beautiful and finding myself in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> was a shocking to my system, so suddenly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Queens</span> now, it was green, the <span class="DLF">park</span> around and the director of pathology was the most beautiful woman in the world as a person, as a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And I got so attached to her, obvious, she didn't have children, I think she sort of, maybe she had some maternal feelings towards me, everybody felt she loved me, I really didn't see it that way, but I love her so that was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">I think that was the main reason I stay in pathology and I wanted so much to please her that I went into my usual, standing on my head, to work, do everything that could be done, so needless to say I was the best worker, the best teacher, learned the <span class="DLF">field</span> perfectly. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And she treated me so well, so I really didn't have the anxiety that I have now and tension. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I Edwarda Rorat 60 February 25, 1996 Page 60 felt like this was my best mother, so I also start socializing. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">This was a nice time for me in my life, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">But I find out that I do not stay in relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">That took me years later to find out what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">I always thought I don't find the right man, but find out later that that's not, everybody finds the right man if one looks for one. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">So that's the pathology.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="862">QUESTION:  But you started, but your life changed, so you had friends, you were socializing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="863">ANSWER:  Yes, oh yes, men.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="864">QUESTION:  Was that difficult for you to start having that kind of life or did it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="865">ANSWER:  No, because they find me attractive. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I find men easily, without looking for them and the work was very satisfying for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">I find out that I am very good in diagnosis and doing, quite I start doing with only experienced doctor do, making diagnosis on the spot during surgery, very responsible and I was very good at it, that gave me good feeling as a physician and also I had the nice, nice atmosphere at work, which really helped.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="868">QUESTION:  Did you have woman friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="869">ANSWER:  Yes, but I had started, started discovering men, so that was the, yeah I had woman friends too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="870">QUESTION:  So you kind of had a delayed adolescence?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="871">ANSWER:  Yes, I really did. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And this woman who I adored so much was already old and she had to retire, so she retired and another man became director and was also a gentleman, wonderful man, I also had very good working relationship with him so it continued for me good, but then the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> start gettting pushed, as you know, the medicine is already being in a Edwarda Rorat 61 February 25, 1996 Page 61 difficult financial situation for years and this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was one of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> on the list to be closed possibly, so that second director left to another <span class="BUILDING">institution</span> and asked me if I liked to go with him to work with him, but I didn't, he was going to <span class="BUILDING">Catholic institution</span> and I thought no, I don't need that. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">That was one of the reasons, so I didn't go with him, but I didn't like to stay, he left and this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was on the list to be closed, so I thought I should do something and then I received telephone call from <span class="BUILDING">Beth Israel Hospital</span> , because my reputation already spread, how good I was, so I received call from <span class="BUILDING">Beth Israel</span> , without me looking for it, would I like to come for interview because they would like to hire me. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">So I went for interview, didn't check anything about director, about the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , about the salary, about my title, just jumped into because I needed a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so that's how I moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beth Israel</span> and that's how I moved to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="875">That was a different world. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">That was very difficult for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">The director there was, I have not enough word for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">It was just, 1t cannot compare to what I had before, it was...

QUESTION:  So you were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beth Israel</span> there, it's difficult. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="879">ANSWER:  Yes, it's difficult because as I said I was straightforward, I did not know the politic, how, I mean it's just the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">I am not a person who knows how to play the games, is the word. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">I am emotional, easily hurt, take things personally and all this didn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">I even found out that when I was the most popular with clinicians, make brilliant diagnosis, the doctor loved my lectures the most, I was doing perfect and I found out, this was an absolute shock for me, that the better I did, the less director cared for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">I don't even want to get on the subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">So this was extremely frustrating and I mean this is life, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">If you have parents they teach you all those things, I see how people are teaching the little children when they're growing up what life is about. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">My life was trying to survive, no one taught me this. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Some people picked it from the <span class="DLF">air</span> , I obviously didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">So here I found this extremely difficult and continue having this difficulty, it's not the medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">I'm the most popular teacher because I'm straightforward and I teach so well, I speak clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">I don't know, somehow the doctors always say I'm the best teacher and it always was through my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">So, my diagnosis are excellent, my teaching is perfect, my work is like I was a robot. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I never get sick, I'm never late, I'm reliable and you know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="893">This doesn't do me much. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">So that's as far as success in the, because it's almost like a corporation the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , you have to get along with so many people and I do get along, but I don't know how to be a politician. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Edwarda Rorat 63 February 25, 1996 Page 63
QUESTION:  Are you happy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="896">ANSWER:  I don't know what this word is, you know what, I am okay if [am content. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Ifno one hurts me, this is plenty for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="898">QUESTION:  You're still afraid of being hurt?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="899">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">I don't know why it means so much to me but I think if somebody's attacking me or I think it's going to attack me or something, I think it's immediately I feel those things, that I am not good, those complexes come back, that I am the worst, yeah, that image, that bad image of myself come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">I think that's what it is, why would I otherwise be so afraid of being hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">I'm very independent, that's the positive part, I can count on myself, I can be alone anywhere, I can travel alone, I can go to <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> alone, I don't mind being alone, that 1s independence. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">I went as far in my <span class="DLF">field</span> as one could. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">I could go higher, like trying to become director, but I never wanted that last stop, either being afraid of so-called success or I don't really like being 1n position of such politics and power ands so on, I don't need it. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">But also something prevents me from that, I think knowing that I'm not politician enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">I actually like diagnosing, I don't like politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Happy, I know that my personal life leaves much to be wished for or desired, but I did find out that relationship doesn't work for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">It brings me as much happiness as there is, but also as much suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">So it almost like comes to neutral, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="910">That I stop thinking about it, I stop looking for it, so it's like a fact that I cannot have relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">It's just something that I didn't learn to be and I had no relationship in my childhood and later. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">I don't know how to be in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">I get so easily hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">The better a Edwarda Rorat 64 February 25, 1996 Page 64 relationship is, the more difficult 1t is for me because I suspect they leave me, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">I become clinging, I become possessive, even if I don't show, the partner feels it. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And I did hear it on more than one occasion that I smother him. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">I think my clinging, my insecurity in that is so obvious that the partner can't take it, or there are no such people who would understand, get along with this, so it, I'm always afraid they leave me and if they don't leave me I leave them, I don't know, it's just the relationship I find difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">It's the happiest moment for me and it's also the toughest and so without a relationship, life 1s not full. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">When I work it seems it's completely full, my work is so demanding and I give so much out of myself that during the day I never know, once I get there nothing exists, no private life, no nothing, I'm so involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">I'm I don't know if this is an escape for me that I don't think of anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">Maybe it is an escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">So that's what I become absorbed in and life goes on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="923">QUESTION:  Have you tried to reconnect with your Jewish, to your Jewish. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="924">ANSWER:  Oh yes, I told you after my American period, I wanted to be American.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="925">QUESTION:  What do you mean your American period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="926">ANSWER:  The time that I wanted to be like Americans and associated with American, American American, not Jewish even. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And then eventually...
QUESTION:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, you're passing over something important. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">You had a certain, you wanted to be something else, you wanted to be American?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="929">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">Like a WASP, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">Edwarda Rorat 65 February 25, 1996 Page 65
QUESTION:  How did you go about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="932">ANSWER:  Well you know, I had the selection of choosing, right, the people who found me attractive, I could select. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">No, about my being Jewish, still had mixed feelings about that, I did not find Jewish men attractive. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">So that made it easy not to socialize with them, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">Then I did, eventually I did and then sort of like coming around again I socialize more with European background. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">I find that I know more what I'm dealing with. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">If they tell me something I can see if they mean it, if they don't, I had very hard time with American hypocrisy, I come from different culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">There, if people like you they tell you, if they didn't like you they didn't say they do. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">They never say I like to see you if they didn't mean it. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">So here I come to the socializing and the people say oh it was great meeting you and I like to see you again, I was taking this exactly as that, I waited for them to call, they never did and all these disappointments, I couldn't understand the hypocrisy, I found it very difficult, so that's what I call my American period. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">I would say it was super, I found it superficial, the link with the American people. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">So I think now, if I think of my closest friends, they are European and some are Jews with similar background as I have, I find that wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Actually my last relationship was with a Jewish man, who also had the, well, had some background during the war but his both parents lived and he really didn't have much hardship except he understood what it means to be a Jew and confronted with anti-Semitism and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">I find that this was so great for me, something in common. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">But that ended, as all my other relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">Actually he ended it, I was very surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">Edwarda Rorat 66 February 25, 1996 Page 66
QUESTION:  You talk mostly about your relationships with men, as opposed to men and women, people in general.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="950">ANSWER:  Yeah, with women, yeah I had some women friends, don't forget that I left my friends in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , the friends that, I mean I think the most serious friends are the one who date from your young years, from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , growing up, right, when you have time to prove yourself? </span><span class="sentence" id="951">My old friends were left behind, I have to have new friends in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="952">So some women, some women I think are jealous of me or something, I was afraid of them maybe, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">I'm okay now with friends with women, but it's the same like with men. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">IfI like women very much, if this is close relationship, I start being possessive also the way I am for men. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">I think it's again the fear that they leave me. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">Is thats a ridiculous thing, I cannot change it. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">So at this point, I don't want to be that close to anybody, because then I cling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="958">QUESTION:  Do you think of yourself now as Jewish or as Catholic or as what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="959">ANSWER:  Jewish because I, you know, I had to take sides, political situation here and also taking holiday in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , I mean somebody has to cover Catholic days and somebody has to cover Jewish, so I took the Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">I take Jewish holidays, even it doesn't feel to me like a holiday at all, but at least I present it to the world that I'm Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">So the holidays don't touch me, but I take it just to show the front that I'm Jewish and I don't work on Jewish holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And also I think politically I am pro-Israel, is something in me that I have no question about it, I am pro-Israel and I was very proud when they win the war in '67. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">I find it so amazing that suddenly they were best soldier, best army and this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is so strong and Edwarda Rorat 67 February 25, 1996 Page 67 the whole world admires them. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">I find it's just like I woke up from the <span class="NPIP">dream</span> , since I was indoctrinated that Jews are cowards, as you know, there's no way they could fight, so many jokes about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">That they're cowards, they don't know anything and I mean, it's endless and suddenly this was, I felt so proud going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and seeing that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="966">QUESTION:  When you came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , did you at any point go into a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="967">ANSWER:  Yes, that again, you know, I don't plan anything, it was a Jewish holiday, some big Jewish holiday, I don't know which one and I didn't realize you have to apply, call before, make arrangement, buy ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Don't forget, I used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> whenever I felt like it, the <span class="DLF">door</span> was always open. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">So I go there and I say I would like to go and he says do you have a ticket, did you apply? </span><span class="sentence" id="970">I say no, but I can pay now. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">He said no, it's too late, you cannot come in, and just closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> in front of my nose. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">That's now how I imagined the, any how do you say, a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> or <span class="BUILDING">church</span> or any <span class="BUILDING">praying place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="973">I find that very disappointing. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">And I gave it another chance, I went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> again and I am very disciplined person, very organized, I am well behaved and I have certain concept of how the place of prayer looks like. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I was seeing the Catholics remember, when they play the music or the priest is having ceremony and people are quietly sitting and listening and praying, so here I'm in <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , everybody's talking around and laughing and I don't know, I find it very disorganized, I didn't like the way it looked, you see, I didn't grow up in that spirit. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And the prayer is in the language I don't understand, so all together I feel Jewish in some point. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">Feel Jewish, whatever that means, but the religion I don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And the holidays I didn't grow up with, but I Edwarda Rorat 68 February 25, 1996 Page 68 do, since I have Jewish friends now from Europe, I do celebrate Yom Kippur with them and Rosh Hashanah. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">So is that similar to your other interviews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="980">QUESTION:  Varies, it varies, but how about for Passover, do you have a seder or go to a seder?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="981">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="982">QUESTION:  Do you feel any kinship with the message of freedom from oppression?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1179">ANSWER:  It was very profound being one of the people, because I, you know, I mean, seeing that the other people in similar situation and this and I mean it was great, Edwarda Rorat 79 February 25, 1996 Page 79 great experience, but later on I tried to follow, they were meeting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> here and there, I did go and it just wasn't the same, I mean it was , the people just come and talk about themselves, about their mundane problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">I just didn't feel I have, nothing was there for me, I didn't go again, just once I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1181">QUESTION:  But that first gathering that you went to, was it freeing for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1182">ANSWER:  Yes, but I was already sort of freed, I told you I went through EST, that was very tough, that was actually my most freeing experience, the est. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">I found out how much rage I have in me and how much scarring is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">It was something I couldn't even comprehend, because they has this technique of blocking your conscious so only the subconscious, something that you buried deep down would come up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">This was when my recollection came about how the war ended for example, how I went to the principal asking him to keep me in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> without paying, all those small things that I thought I've completely forgot, but most of all how much rage is there, buried deep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">Well maybe rage is just one of the feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">How much pain is there after all those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">So in some way it was liberating, in some other ways it was disappointing to find out because I always thought I dealt with it very well, I blocked my childhood, I blocked my past. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">I was tough on the surface, not crying, going along with my work, with my studying, with my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">And actually I was pleased how I overcome the tragic past and there I find out I didn't overcome, all of this is in me, it's just buried there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">So that was the sad and disappointing part, knowing that the past is sabotaging me quite often and just cannot separate it, it's there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">So I have moments that I am more patient with myself Edwarda Rorat 80 February 25, 1996 Page 80 now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">And so there, and I really don't like much dwelling on the past because nothing I can do about that and I just hope that this interview help somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">I know how people who never lived through the war have no idea what's important and how they don't handle the real emergencies well and I must say I feel very proud of myself how well I handle emergencies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">It seems I handle emergencies better than I handle peaceful times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">I'm not maybe used to much of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">The people who never had to really, they didn't live through poverty, they didn't live through the war, they didn't live through tragedy, they're so attached to their little things, their chocolate they didn't have or it starts snowing, they don't have right clothes, I mean the smallest thing, they actually fall apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">So when I look at this I say, my gosh, I am so equipped to life in some ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">In some ways, not in others.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1200">QUESTION:  Do you ever find yourself helping other people through difficulty because you've had that experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1201">ANSWER:  I find that most of my life, I only listen to other people, I don't talk about myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">I only find them important and never me, that's how I live and then I start rebelling against this, actually through this retreat of mine I found out what true loving is, it means truly accepting the other human beings and I start rebelling, these friends who really don't give a damn about me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1203">QUESTION:  So when you meet people now you say, look we won't be friends for long, don't get too close?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1204">ANSWER:  No, that's not the issue, the issue is I'm afraid to be too close because I know that this will Edwarda Rorat 81 February 25, 1996 Page 81 end and then I would be heartbroken so that's I'm not getting close, but I became more realistic about friends who are really not friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">That now I would like something in return. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">Through my life I was always giver, giver, giver, giver, I must say that that changed lately, I would like this to be at least both ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">Where were we? </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">Oh yes, helping. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">It's just work and giving, giving, giving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">Do you know that I will never know how to ask about my salary, or increase or my needs of vacation or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">I don't know how to do this and if it's not given to me, I'm very disappointed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">I think one should be recognize and this should be part of it and I find life is not like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">So if I'm not given increase, I will not ask for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">I will never ask for vacation when I want it, I only take it when nobody else wants it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">I will say this is a giver. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">That's how it is at work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">But I also do count my blessings, I'm in perfect health. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">I never had to take any drugs or alcohol or any other addictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">I manage without, the way I manage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">So those are the blessings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">I suppose my profession is too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">It is a very interesting and gratifying profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">And I being in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> counts too, I certainly don't like what's happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , I mean the way of this persecution during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">Now it's after the war and nothing much changed, sometimes but not all along and I don't like the politics, I don't care what's happening there so this is a blessing, being here, but I am transplanted at the old age, I do miss my language, I miss the culture in which I grew, my poetry, my jokes, which never could be translated, the customs and so on and so on and this one cannot replace.</span></p>

QUESTION:  So in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettin</span> there were no people who were like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1229">ANSWER:  No, I would have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and somehow I didn't think of doing that and also I do not keep revenge, I don't have this in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">I did have chance to punish them after the war, the father of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wanda</span> was tried, he was in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , he was found that he killed some Jewish people and she probably didn't kill, she was the woman, but she certainly was cruel to me and I could have hurt them if I testify that I remember something of them killing Jews and you know I could not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">I went to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and I saw him old and lost weight and looked so miserable and I just, I don't know, I just could not bring myself to say anything against him, so I didn't and the years, so that helped him that I did not testify against him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And years later when my sister find out that I didn't testify against him, she absolutely couldn't stand me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">How could I? </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">How could I do nothing? </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">I just couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">Time passed and I did not feel anything toward him, I had no feelings good or bad and maybe, I mean this is how I am, if I felt that hate to him or to others it probably would destroy me.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1238">ANSWER:  Few years ago, I don't know how long, it was on the wedding of her daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">We really were separated, we're different people and maybe we have similar problems, she has Edwarda Rorat 83 February 25, 1996 Page 83 problems with relationships, with feelings, with things and I don't know what it 1s, maybe both are too proud, too afraid to show our feelings, so hurt or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">We don't relate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">But she knows all about me through her daughters and I know about her through her daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">So there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1243">QUESTION:  Have you talked to your nieces about your experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1244">ANSWER:  Actually very little, but I did tell them little more than my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">My sister did not want them to know about the war, about our experiences, she wanted them to be normal American children and this really didn't always work, because it wasn't easy to be her child, as I found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">And they were in troubles, coming to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">So in my small ways I was telling them that they have to be more understanding toward their mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">No one could change my sister, so I wouldn't tell her that she does something wrong, but I told them many things that I'm sure make their life easier together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">I told them at one time, what would you do if you suddenly didn't have your mommy and your daddy and they say, Edie are you crazy, that's impossible, so I said just imagine that she was without parents, was younger than you and not only that there was no food and clothes and no shelter, but she could be killed any time, any minute, that's how she was growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">So they were looking at me completely shocked, that's not possible, so I told them, that leaves something, that does leave people like this do have problems later on and if she has, if she doesn't communicate with you the way you imagine, just think of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">So I think that that helped them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">And I do not dwell on other experienced, I don't think that they are that curious or that it's needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">But sometimes they see my values, Edwarda Rorat 84 February 25, 1996 Page 84 that I don't have that in me, that I have to prove something, that I have to show off, that at any time I needed the greatest jewelry or the fashion clothes or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">They don't understand it that I don't have these aspirations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">So I think that also helped them because they were always desiring to have something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">So I think yeah, I think that that helped them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">I talk to them sometimes about the, my values, maybe our discussions a little more profound that they have them at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">They say, sometimes we talk, what do you talk with your mother about, it's usually about shopping, about whom will you marry, I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">So it's a little different topic that I would have with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">I would tell them that the money's not going to make you happy or a different person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">It makes life easier, but doesn't solve the problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">This is our topics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">I think we talked about everything, didn't we? </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">Or I talked, you ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">Maybe we change the rolls now.</span></p>
