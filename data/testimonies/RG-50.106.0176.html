<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  We lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and in fact my mother said that we even had a German officer who was one of the nice ones at that time, quartered in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , because what they used to do 1s to put the officers into people’s <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And she said he was quite sympathetic to the Jews, but was removed at some -- at some point. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">My father and my Uncle Ruvin, when -- when rumors started to come up that bad things -- that there was a threat -- rumors of threat were in the <span class="DLF">air</span> , and my father and his -- and -- and my Uncle Ruvin actually started to moo -- to try to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and then maybe bring the families with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">But a lot of Jews were going east to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , even though they knew it was no picnic and they’d wind up in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">But for some reason they couldn’t get in and they were turned back and they came back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and then eventually, when the Germans began to round up all able-bodied men and take them away for labor, and we never heard from them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And -- and my mother variously said -- I still don’t know and I still want to do some research in the newly opened ar-archives in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that he -- they were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chelmno</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> , or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">But meanwhile we were left behind in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and when -- one day -- and I don’t remember, I wish my mother were around now to fill in the <span class="DLF">gaps</span> , we -- she got wind that there was going to be some action against the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So my mother alerted her brothers and sisters -- and sister and -- and my grandmother, and we left and ran away to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> surrounding that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And we remained -- that was the beginning of our period in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> of the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , which lasted for a bit over two years, living- if you’ve seen the movie “Defiance’’, living in <span class="DLF">holes</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> or in <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> made out of branches, but also moving around. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">People think it was a stationary, you s -- you settled down in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , no, you didn’t settle down in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you moved to -- from dangerous <span class="NPIP">places</span> to safer <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And you’re constantly -- were on the lookout. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So going through that kind of, you know, typical stuff, looking for food from surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> or peasants.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  Did your mother ever tell you who was in the group? </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Were there other children? </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Were you the only child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  Well initially we -- when we left it was just our family unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">It was my mother’s two brothers and their families, my aunt, who was a single woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">My Aunt Rachel was single, and my --
QUESTION:  So you were not part of a partisan group or anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Not initially.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  Not initially.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  But eventually what happened was we were in --
QUESTION:  Let’s talk about initially first.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  Well initially -- the first night I can tell you my mother claims th -- because she -- they ran away, She said she didn’t even have time to take wa -- it was already tow -- it’s towards fall, I believe, getting close to winter and she didn’t take any clothing for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So come nighttime, you know, I was crying and you know, and she was ready to go back and she started to go back and she met a peasant along the way who said, where you going? </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And she said, we’re going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nisregin</span> , he said, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ’s been burnt down.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  Are we talking about fall of °41? </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Is that what you --
ANSWER:  Probably, 1s my hunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">But I -- you know, I -- I --
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  I’m not keen on the dates. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">In any case, when we -- when we ran -- so she turned back and we stayed in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> , you know, and we continued in our wanderings, so we’d meet up with other groups, and what happened was that people find each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">So there was other stragglers, other civilians, Jews, but in our peregrinations we also wound up meeting with partisan groups eventually, sometimes hostile and sometimes friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Sometimes -- we didn’t have Jewish partisan groups like you -- you had sometimes further north in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , per se, but we met up with a number of different non-Jewish partisan groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And they weren't all friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And -- but I do begin to remember -- you know, it’s hard to distinguish sometimes what you’ve dreamed and what stories you’ve integrated from other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I do begin to remember the lib -- the liberation, when the Russians came in and -- and -- and thereafter. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I was very sick in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , and this I was told by my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I developed -- because I was an infant, I was what, less than two years old when the war -- and I developed diphtheria and I was close to death, I mean, I -- s - you know, so my mother took me to a <span class="BUILDING">field hospital</span> , miles away, where the Russians treated -- th-the partisans and the military had a <span class="BUILDING">field hospital</span> and she wanted them to treat me and -- and the officer in charge says look at all the people, we have soldiers in there and I don’t have time for -- for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So she took me back and -- to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">encampment</span> and through some -- I forget what she told me, they -- in e -- in essence they gave me what would today be considered a vaporizer treatment and it seemed to work, some remedy that they found, and I survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  Are there any other -- I hate to used the word anecdotes, but stories that your mother told you about that time, before you remembered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  Y-Yeah, I mean, she would tell me about what it was like to go and search for food, for example, and how dangerous that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And some of the people, because you would -- you would have to leave -- you were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> was both safety, but it was also deprivation. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Safety in the sense that organized armies don’t go into <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Not out of fear, but you know, it’s- you -- you just don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I mean, you don’t bring in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and armor and what have you into <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So you -- you -- so people can hide in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">On the other hand, you’re deprived of food and y-you know, we weren’t hunters, you know what I mean, it’s not like -- yeah, I mean people ate -- you know, they ate berries or they ate mushrooms of they f -- whatever they found. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But they would also go out, leave the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and go to some peasants that they knew or some farmer, because the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> were still in the <span class="REGION">area</span> and we wa -- we had not yet wandered far enough into it, so you were able to leave and go and get some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">But of course that presupposed that the -- th-the peasant you were going to was not going to sell you out and was not going to inform the Germans that you were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So it was fraught with danger and of course some of the people that they knew, other Jews, were killed on these missions. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So she would tell me about these things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  How would you describe your mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">She sounds like a very strong woman to have gone through this, and kept you alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  She was -- I do [indecipherable] describe her, an-and the way I have described her is she was great in a crisis, but she was not so great in dealing with normal day to day life. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And I really mean that. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And there are certain people who, when they face a crisis can galvanize and mobilize all their -- you know, their -- their resources, psychological, physical etcetera and move into gear. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And there are others who are paralyzed by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And she was able to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Well, here she was a young woman in her 20’s --
ANSWER:  She was a young --
QUESTION:  -- with a baby.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  That’s right, a young woman with a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And it’s something that -- 1t wasn’t until I was much older that I was able to appreciate what it took.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  All right, now let’s move up to your [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  -- and what -- what you said your first memory in [indecipherable] before --
ANSWER:  My first memory was actually being liberated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Well, describe that, what your memory --
ANSWER:  Oh, there’s another anecdote, you asked for anecdotal information. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I actually had my first taste of alcohol when I was a child in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , because one of the groups, the -- this again my mother told me, not that I remember it, one of the partisan groups we met up with -- and -- and the relation with the partisan group, even if they were unfriendly, they were like protectors, you know, so you wanted -- civilians wanted to be near partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">On the other hand, you were also -- sometimes feared them. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">This group was not well disposed to Jews apparently, but they took a liking to me because I was a cute -- according to my mother, a cute child. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So they took me -- they would take me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">They would ad -- literally take me away from her and take me to their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military camp</span> and there taught me how to drink booze. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So -- but my own memory that I can, you know, say this, I remember this, was actually riding out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> on an ox drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> heaped with whatever belongings people had. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So when you see those films of refugees, you know, and in that’s -- you know, I remember sitting on top of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> and being afraid I'd fall down.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  Did you have any idea, being a toddler at the time, what was happening? </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Was it something good, was it something scary? </span><span class="sentence" id="155">You know, do you remember being scared or do you remember being excited?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  No, probably scared.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  Yeah, because you were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> --
ANSWER:  I -- I would say that the -- the -- at that time, you know, there were, a little bit later -- because the war was still going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  And we were, in our part of <span class="REGION">western Ukraine</span> , because don’t forget, the -- the geography is -- I mean, not -- [interruption] Excuse me, does anybody want tea or anything? </span><span class="sentence" id="160">No?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  Anyway, when we were liberated, this was only the beginning of the westward march in a sense, not -- not quite the beginning, but it -- I would say the -- the war still had a long ways to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">But our <span class="REGION">area</span> was clear, but it doesn’t mean the war stopped, we still experienced air -- air raids, for example, constantly the Germans would come over and bomb, and I remember those.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  What were they like?</span></p>
