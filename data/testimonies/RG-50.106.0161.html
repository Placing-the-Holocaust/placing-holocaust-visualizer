ANSWER:  Sorry, I didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">We had a slight glitch, I think we’re okay now. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Where did you grow up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  Well, I grew up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bochum</span> and we lived there until we left for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  What was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> like? </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Was it a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , or a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  It was a medium sized <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , which has since grown to a population of over 400,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">It was a grimy industrial coal mining and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">manufacturing city</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  Did your family have a long history in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Yes, quite. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">There are several generations and -- in <span class="REGION">western Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Were there many Jews in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  There were ha -- accounted for in the general congregation, something over 1100, of whom about four came back after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  Before the war, before Hitler came to power, what were the relationships like between the Jews and the non-Jews in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Apparently peaceful enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My father represented the miner’s union.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  Was your family religiously observant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  Not extremely so. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">The major holidays, yes, but among the Jews in <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> , things were sort of loose, but we were members of the congregation and I attended the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  Did you have a favorite holiday, and if you did, why? </span><span class="sentence" id="34">August 14, 2003
ANSWER:  I guess the two favorite ones were Passover and Hanukkah. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">For Passover we often went to grandparents who kept their matzos in a big barrel, and Hanukkah for obvious reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Well, not so obvious. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">What were your favorite reasons?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  Mostly -- oh, gifts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  When you were a child, did you personally ever see Hitler?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  Never saw him, but when we were at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the Nazis would come by and make sure that we were sitting at our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desks</span> in our best clothes, listening to the speeches.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  When you think back to your childhood, can you remember any personal experiences that you had with anti-Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  Well, things began to boil up very quickly after Hitler took power. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">The people who owned the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which we rented an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , their o -- late teens to early 20’s sons were among the first je -- to join the party. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">They paraded around in their brown shirts. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Some of the children in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> joined the Hitlerjugend, the Hitler Youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And of course there was always the spectacle of the marches up and down. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We lived on the corner of a main <span class="DLF">street</span> , and the spectacle of the parades up and down with the flags, the music, the torches, and get away from that <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">The atmosphere of fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  Do you have any memories of your childhood before the Nazis began to gain power? </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Do you have any fond memories of your early childhood in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ”? </span><span class="sentence" id="51">August 14, 2003
ANSWER:  I guess just a normal childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Playing in the <span class="DLF">park</span> and learning to ice skate, playing with other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">It didn’t take long though, before this atmosphere of fear set it. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Very early, probably in 1933, we’d began to have what in retrospect I find very surprising, blackout drills. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Had to put curtain -- not curtains, but blankets on the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , don’t turn on any lights. </span><span class="sentence" id="56"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Cars</span> down below had to paint their head -- headlights blue. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And in retrospect, in the early 30’s, I find this very surprising.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  Was there any explanation for this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  That was the way it was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I was young enough not to know any real reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">The other thing was the so-called Winterhilfe. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Once a week people were required to have a meal that was prepared in one pot, and the amount of money that was saved, presumably, by having a thick soup or something of that sort, was to be given to the poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">During the winter the Nazis would come knocking on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , peek in the pots, and collect what you presumably saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">To this day I do not like to eat pea soup or lentil soup, for that reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  Did your parents try to explain any of the Nazi related events to you when they began? </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I-I realize you were young, but did they try in any way to explain the situation to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  They tried to shield me as much as possible, but my father, who is a -- really a -- a person who saw things that were coming, and he tried to persuade others that 1t wasn’t August 14, 2003 just a passing fad, and when he was fired and no longer allowed to practice, he said it’s time to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Why was he fired?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  For being Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  When you think back to the events when Hitler came to power, do you remember some of the first signs that things were changing? </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Do you remember it <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in any way, or all of a sudden is it just in your mind as all around you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  It didn’t take long, but the young people who lived in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , showing up in their Nazi uniforms, other people and pushing people around. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">My father was arrested for no good reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">His law partner was beaten up in an <span class="DLF">alley</span> and left for dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Fortunately he wasn’t and managed to emigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in later years. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">But when things began to happen that way, he said it was time to get out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Once he decided it was time to go, what efforts did he make to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  Well, we were more fortunate than most. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">My mother had a sister who came to live in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> with her family following World War I. And they invited my father to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , look around for a few weeks and see if it was possible to come and possibly make a living and then decide to apply for a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And they then signed an affidavit for us that permitted us to come into this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  How long did the process take from when he first decided to come until you got the paperwork all in order? </span><span class="sentence" id="82">August 14, 2003
ANSWER:  Probably something over a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  During this time did anyone try to stop you or make it difficult for you to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  I don’t really know about that, there are family members who said, oh don’t just run off, it’s going to stop, it will all be over. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And my father said, I don’t think it will stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And he made up his mind and he is fortunate, some members of his family were fortunate to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Others were not so fortunate, were lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Both my father’s family and mother’s family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  During that time between when he made up his mind that he was going to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and you were waiting for the paperwork, you said it was about a year, how were things changing in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> during that year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  I would say it was just more of the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">More of the marches up and down the <span class="DLF">street</span> , more of your child laughed at that -- a-a-at our man in uniform, you’re gonna get in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Or just watch very carefully where you walk, how you walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Stay out of trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Just don’t call attention to yourself in any way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  What was happening in your life during this time, before you left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in that year, or a little more than a year from when Hitler came to power, until you left. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">What were you doing in your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  I was a school kid, and some of the families there were also hoping to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">But o-others were still ready to tough it out and see what would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">August 14, 2003
QUESTION:  You mentioned before that you went to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , did I hear you correctly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">The <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> were both burned down later on Kristallnacht.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  But while you were still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , was there any problem with attending a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  No, it was not shut down until after I had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And at that time my teacher made it her business to teach those children that were still there even after the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">She taught them in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">Juden house</span> and then she began smuggling them, at great risk to herself, across the <span class="DLF">border</span> into the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bochum</span> is not far from the <span class="DLF">Dutch border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And she managed to get out quite a number of -- of children, although she herself was later deported and died.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  It -- do you have any other memory that sticks out in your mind from that time, before you left, in that year or so before you left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ”
ANSWER:  It was mostly sort of apprehension. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">As a matter of fact, where would we go? </span><span class="sentence" id="110">My parents were beginning to study conversational Hebrew in case we couldn’t get into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I had a little bit of Hebrew in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> of course, but that was prayer book Hebrew, and no English whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  Did your parents speak any English?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">In their professions, they were multilingual. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">No-Not very good conversationally, but most educated people in those days knew some French, some August 14, 2003 English. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">My mother being a singer, had to a-at least know how to pronounce Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">My father, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, in addition to English, French, German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  Did you have any doubts or reservations about leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Di-Did you want to stay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  I was young enough to just do what my parents wanted me to do, and there was enough fear there that it couldn’t be any worse in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  Do you remember when your parents told you that now is the time to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  Well, the preparations were ongoing. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So then I began to read a little bit about <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . [ </span><span class="sentence" id="124">thought I would find Indians, and my father had visited the relatives who lived, at the time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chevy Chase</span> , D.C., and he said it’s next to <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I pictured a little <span class="DLF">gate</span> going from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">District of Columbia</span> into <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So I didn’t really know what to expect.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  What did you take with you and what did your parents take with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Well they were allowed to take a few things which a lot of people later -- in later years were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So, a few items of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , they were allowed to take books, my mother’s music and some of my favorite books, a doll. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And tha -- that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I wanted to get rid of the German looking clothes as fast as I could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Do you remember saying good-bye to people? </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Were you allowed to do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  Yes, I -- as a matter of fact I have a page in my autograph book, written by the schoolteacher that I mentioned before. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And yes, of course, we took our leave of August 14, 2003 friends, that was still permitted in those days, and the grandparents in a nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , the grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">The grandfather had died many years before. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And a-an uncle -- those people -- Grandmother died of natural causes, the uncle died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gross-Rosen</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  When?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  I’m not sure of the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I tried to find that out in the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">museum library</span> , but they didn’t have the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">One of my father’s brothers was listed as fashon, which means assumed dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">He was deported, but they don’t know the actual date. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">One of my mother’s brothers, a younger brother, we managed to bring to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> with his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">An older brother lived through most of the war, but managed to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">My father’s oldest brother was deported and killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Another brother escaped to <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And another brother was incarcerated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> for a number of months, but was released and managed to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> with his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">My father also worked on bringing over as many people as he could of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">With some he was successful, in others he was not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  For those that he was not successful in bringing over, do you know why he was unsuccessful on those attempts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  Probably just bureaucracy, paperwork. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">By that time these people had been deported and you couldn’t even find most of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  Would you, for the record, give me the name of the teacher that you told us about? </span><span class="sentence" id="154">August 14, 2003
ANSWER:  Oh yeah, her name was IIse Hirsch, H-i-r-s-c-h. When we read names on Yom HaShoah in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , she is always on my list to read.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="305">QUESTION:  What was his job when he finally got the papers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">ANSWER:  He -- well, basically, economist. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">People who studied law in Europe, it’s a different system and they could not practice here and he felt he was too old to go back to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> and learn American law. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And besides, it cost too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So he -- but he had a very broad, general education, so that permitted him to work as an economist, and since the war was approaching, he was able to fill in a lot of information about industrial production, coal mining and the like from -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because that had been his background, even when he was a lawyer for the coalminer’s union.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="327">QUESTION:  Oh, so she was blaming the victims, is that what you --
ANSWER:  Yes, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">That was the -- at least partially, the nature of that congregation. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">They were mostly well-to-do business people or professionals. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">They had no problems in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , so the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> must have done it themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">But the August 14, 2003 rabbi was a mensch, said we want to educate this child, let her in. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And I wanted very much to go.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="334">ANSWER:  No, except that my mother always had the fear that I’m going to do something to turn people against me and against Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Whenever I left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , now don’t go out and make anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Don’t dress in flamboyant clothes, don’t dress in too bright colors. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Don’t be loud. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Just stay in the background and you’ll stay out of trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">This - even in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  Well there’s a difference between anti-German and anti-Semitic by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And of course people were making anti-German remarks. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">They had names for Germans, Krauts and th -- you name it, but at that point I was old enough to know that that didn’t apply to me.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="592">QUESTION:  How were you treated by the Germans, the average person, when you came back to visit?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="598">QUESTION:  How was it for you to be back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="599">What was the feeling you had?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">ANSWER:  It’s really indescribable. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I didn’t want to be there and yet I did, and I said th -- the Shehecheyanu to myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Never thought I’d be there ever again, but they -- they made it so easy for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And I had been totally afraid all those years and they -- they made it easy for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">QUESTION:  Have you ever been to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="605">August 14, 2003
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I’ve been back twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">My husband worked there for three months shortly after we came to <span class="REGION">northern Virginia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="608">At the time we couldn’t afford to all go. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And then, several years later, he gave a paper at a U.N. conference, dealing with the work that he had done before, and at that time we took all our children. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And then one other time we went to an <span class="BUILDING">elder hostel</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And at that time we met up with some of our old friends as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="612">QUESTION:  Is there anything that we haven’t mentioned that you would like to talk about before we conclude the interview today?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">ANSWER:  Only that I’m still finding out and learning things, both by keeping in touch with old friends and by working at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">One person leads to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I was just sent a clipping from the German newspaper that dealt with the experiences of my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friend of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who now lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cape Town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cape Town</span> they have just opened a <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">She escorted me through it the day before Nelson Mandela was to appear for the opening. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">We couldn’t stay for that, but their focus is a little different, but wherever there is a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> -- and there are now many of them throughout the world, we have gone to see what they’ve got to teach the world.</span></p>
