<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  What language or languages were spoken in your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> when you were growing up? </span><span class="sentence" id="12">August 18, 2003
ANSWER:  ’'m of Romanian ancestry and consequently both my parents had emigrated from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and as a result spoke Romanian in th -- in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , I used to answer the teacher sometimes in Romanian when I didn’t know how to speak it in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">But nevertheless, mostly Romanian as a youngster, and then -- excuse me -- as I grew up it just completely changed to English and didn’t use it again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Can you tell me please about your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> from your childhood? </span><span class="sentence" id="15">What kinds of childhood memories do you have of your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Well, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Youngstown</span> at that time was a very thriving me-metropolis because it was on the theater circuit. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">My father was a very avid theater-goer, so I recall going to the <span class="BUILDING">Hippodrome</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">Palace theaters</span> and seeing the old magician shows with Thurston and Blackstone and those, and seeing Al Jolson u-up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stage</span> in person while in my father’s lap, and then later on as his a-accompanying [indecipherable].</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  What else do you remember about your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  Well, I -- I -- of course I remember going to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , perhaps more so than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I was a pretty good student actually, I was val-valedictorian of my class. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And it was during the early wartime, in -- in 1943 when I graduated, and --
QUESTION:  I-I’m going to not get the war years just yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">August 18, 2003
QUESTION:  Were there many Jews in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> when you were growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  Certainly in the <span class="REGION">area</span> that I grew up in because it was a -- what we call a mixed area. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">There were Jews, there were French, there were Italians, and -- in fact, it was almost a -- a conglomeration of just every -- every language there was spoken. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And as a result, actually when I was younger, I spoke some of the other languages, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I learned how to speak a little Hungarian and a little bit of Italian, which makes it easier because Romanian and Italian are pretty much aligned. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And under those circumstances even as a youngster, we went to each other’s <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and so forth and heard it spoken because that’s what most people spoke at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And, oh, we were at that time, foreigners. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">My father had ra -- come here, as I said, working in the <span class="BUILDING">steel mills</span> and when the war broke out and -- first World War, he volunteered to go and he was in the American expeditionary force, and when the war was over he automatically became a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And he was still a young man, he was only in his 20’s and decided to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and find somebody to marry. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And he met my mother and they had a -- a courtship that lasted a short period of time, and he got married there in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and came here, and brought her with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And s -- at the time that she came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , she was pregnant and I was born -- she got here in February and I was born in March, in 1925. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I can always say I was conceived there and dedicated here. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">August 18, 2003
QUESTION:  You said you came from a community with a lot of different people [indecipherable] different --
ANSWER:  Ethnic groups, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  -- ethnic groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">How did they all get along, and how -- specifically how did people get along?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  How did the Jewish community get along with the Christian community?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  We had a ver -- marvelously -- that’s -- we had friends that were Romanian Jews that spoke Romanian and actually they didn’t call themselves Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I don’t think there was any distinction back in those days a-about being a Hebrew or a Jew or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And you were Greek or you were Italian, that’s fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And we all played together and we all commiserated with each other when things went wrong, and it was -- the relationship was exceptional, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  You told me about your father’s livelihood, but you didn’t tell me his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">What was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  His -- his name was John also. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So I’m really, to all intents and purposes, junior, but he never used his middle name, so I -- but I have, so I -- that distinguishes me from him, cause I’m a Charles.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  And what was your mother’s name? </span><span class="sentence" id="49">August 18, 2003
ANSWER:  My mother’s name was Victoria, and she was -- her maiden name was Morjiniana, which just means marginal in nature, coming from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain area</span> , and her father’s and -- and her -- her parents were from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , the munchan, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> , that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> that is western part of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Carpathian mountains</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  What work did your mother do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  My mother had finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and -- at mo -- moment that my father brought her here. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">She went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> here to speak English, and she was a seamstress for a period of time and during the war working in a -- a -- as a supervisor in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> making uniforms and raincoats and so forth for the military.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Do you have any siblings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  No, I’m an only child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  You mentioned <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , do you remember anything about <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , and do you know the name of your <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Oh, I have some nice, fond thoughts of my <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> because in the fourth grade I had the teacher named McLaughlin who was very fond of me and I was a good student and she challenged me in more ways than one, in the work that I was doing because I got special work over and above what she taught the general class, because it was such a mixed group. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And it was at that time that my mother and I went to visit Europe and this teacher encouraged it, even though I was going to be August 18, 2003 absent for a period of time, and encouraged it very strongly and wa -- I wrote to her and we communicated during the time I was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">As a result though, I was gone about a year and a half and went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there, 1-in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , so going back to the - my parent’s <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And -- but decided at that time -- the decision, that is, was left to me by my parents as to whether I wanted to stay there or whether I wanted to come back here and I chose to come back here, wanting to be back in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and from then on it was just here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  When you were a child, what were your plans for your future, or your ambitions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  As -- as a child my own ambitions were always -- they were led by my parents because the thing that they wanted most of all was for me to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And whatever it was that I did, it didn’t make any big difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I always leaned toward being a doctor, and my father said, if that’s what you want to be, that’s fine, go ahead, let’s -- but you’ve got to excel in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and -- and this was the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And of course the depression held things back considerably during that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And we always fared very well, though, because my father had a good -- good job and worked se- several days a week and so that we always didn’t have to worry about whether we had enough food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> or anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  What did you do for fun when you were a kid?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  Well, abs -- I was pretty athletic so I wa -- we played baseball and football. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I played a little baseball. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We had baseball group that collected in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and August 18, 2003 we played other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> , so we had -- th-that was a real big, going thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And football, I tried football in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> for a short period of time, but I was wiser than most kids and I quit it. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">They didn’t pay very much in those days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Did you come from a religiously observant family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">My father came from a minister’s family. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Actually, a second family. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">His father was married and had five children and th-the diphtheria epidemic hit them and all of them died, including his wife, and he was left single and still a young man and a minister. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And he remarried and then he had the five other children and my father was the youngest of those five. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">A-Actually a favorite of my -- of my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">But they -- he was a minister there and my father kept all the -- the [indecipherable] and all holidays and -- and -- and I -- I grew up that way cause we were Orthodox and un -- under those circumstances, we went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">When he came here as a young man, he built the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> that was the <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">They dug it with their own hands and shovels and so forth to put the foundations in and so on, it was just something. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">The <span class="BUILDING">church</span> still stands, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  The name of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  It’s Saint Mary’s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Youngstown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And then <span class="BUILDING">Holy Cross</span> is what it’s called now cause they moved into a big section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> now, near the Butler’s Art Museum and the -- and the <span class="BUILDING">Youngstown colleges</span> in a very, very special section in <span class="DLF">Wick Avenue</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  Did you have any favorite traditions or holidays when you were a child? </span><span class="sentence" id="88">August 18, 2003
ANSWER:  Yes, Easter is our biggest tradition and most favorite. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Not only my parents, but I guess it’s because I was a youngster it always 1s, and it was always a -- one of our biggest holidays.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  Why’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Oh, I guess it was because of the -- the -- the birth of Christ and all and the story that goes along with it and -- and how it all happened and what it meant to begin with.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Did you ever witness any anti-Semitism in your childhood before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  There -- there was no such thing in no -- not in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , no. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">This was a mixed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> as I mentioned before. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">None. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  What do you remember hearing about Hitler before the war started? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Did you hear anything at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  Yes, from my father particularly because he was in World War I and the stories that he told about that war were easily translated into what was going on there now. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And he was quite happy that I had decided not to stay there because that’s when Hitler was rising in his power and he said, this man is evil. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And some of the things that he was perpetrating against his own -- own people there, even though he wasn’t a real German, were pretty atrocious. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">August 18, 2003
QUESTION:  It sounds like your father was quite aware of what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but we-were you also aware of things like, let’s say the Berlin Olympics, do you remember that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  Yes, I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And Kristallnacht, yes, yes, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">The reason for that is because my father was a very avid follower of what was going on and s -- and not only by paper but radio had just come in during this particular time and we had a good radio that we kept up with what was going on, and as a result it rubbed off on me because when we talked about it and -- even at <span class="BUILDING">church</span> or anyplace else, and the men spoke, the children were there and we listened and we heard an-and participated actually, in -- in many of the discussions that were had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  Do you remember any of the things that were said in <span class="BUILDING">church</span> about Hitler and what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  Oh yes, that -- that he was an evil man that had deposed the -- most of the hierarchy that was there in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and was taking control at that particular time, and that he had started blo -- marking the Jews and putting a-armbands on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And he was taking the books that were written by them at that time and everybody was saying that this was an evil action.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  Do you remember your friends from your multi-ethnic <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> ever talking about events in Europe before the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="110">August 18, 2003
ANSWER:  Yes, I had one that was pretty close. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">He was Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">He had his family and his sister, So -- were older than I was -- or he wasn’t, but th-thi -- he had older sisters, and they taught us how to dance, and -- and they were the -- the hoi polloi of the <span class="REGION">area</span> , actually, for that matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">The girls were, they were just beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And they were very, very strongly against anything th -- and they were strong Catholics. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">There they were, strong Catholics with an Orthodox boy in their midst, and that was me, and -- but we loved each other an-and got along quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And they -- they also were aware of what was going on, very, very, very much so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Did you ever see any newsreels or anything before the war that showed what was happening over there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  Yes, I remember the eye and ears of the world that we used to see at -- as -- as a youngster. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">In between features at the movies there would always be some news thing and we would see what was happening and see the crowds and the way that people were responding and all the Germans were responding to Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">They were -- it seemed now that I look back over it, as 1f they were mesmerized by this man and that he was a hypnotist that had them under control, because it was all seeming so put on, but it wasn’t just put on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  Do you have any other memories that stand out in your mind from the time before the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="122">August 18, 2003
ANSWER:  I guess there -- there -- there would be good times and bad times. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I remember that during the depression my -- I wanted to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> and just to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> was an expensive thing at that time, 1t was maybe 50 or 75 dollars, well my goodness. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And my father said, well, we will get you the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> , but you got to teach yourself how to type. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And I says okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So he bought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> for me and I got the books with it and taught myself how to type. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And then went to take it in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and the teacher said, after I sat down there, she said, you already know how. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I’ll give you credit for the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">In the meantime, go do something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So I was -- that was something that really stood me in good stead. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I recall that specifically because of -- of how it came about. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And most of the things that I -- that I wanted as a youngster, being an only child, I got on the basis that I could earn them and -- and use them. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">They were not something that was not utilitarian, they were always something that could add to my benefit, or our benefit, or our total benefit, or everybody’s benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  Do you have any recollections of when Hitler moved into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Do you have [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Mm-hm, the Sudetenland, yes, very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">My father was just upset, I mean upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I remember him personally being upset, saying how could this -- how could this happen, and what is Chamberlain doing over there in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , mollifying these people, you know, and -- and saying that this is not right. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And the people that we, in August 18, 2003 our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> were concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And th-they were worried about our being -- go- going to war. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">My father didn’t want me to go in the service either, and he says, you know, I already did, I spent all my time in the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Why should you have to go, again? </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So --
QUESTION:  Do you remember any of your Jewish friends saying anything about all these events at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">The Jewish friends that I had, in fact one of -- one of mine was very close, taught me how to play chess. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">He was a very intelligent youngster, he was a couple of years older than I, lived up the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And he said -- I was playing checkers with one of the other neighbors, and he said, did you ever play chess? </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And I s -- never even paid any attention to it, I knew what it was, but we didn’t have it in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> back in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And he says, well Ill bring my chessboard down and I’ Il teach you how, but you’re never going to beat me. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And I says, oh, come on. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Four or five years went by and I finally did beat him. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">But then that was about the last time I’d seen him of -- really, because I left when I was 17, I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and I was in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> when I went into the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So I never really came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Youngstown</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">All my memories are from 17 down instead of up. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Just going back to visit my folks is about the only thing that --
QUESTION:  What did this fr -- you didn’t tell me the name of this friend who taught you chess, but wha-what did he say about what was happening in Europe? </span><span class="sentence" id="155">August 18, 2003
ANSWER:  Oh, they -- they -- they said that this -- this was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Why are they picking on the Jewish people and why are wa -- bu-but it wasn’t only that, my father was pointing out to them that they -- th-that they were incarcerating people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and things like that that weren’t Jewish, they were just politically against what he was for, and that -- and that was what they were saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And -- and so many of them, of course, had relatives that were there, and they had relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , but most of the ones that we knew were of Romanian ancestry, and so that the ones that were Romanian would eat Romanian food and the ethnic mixture, and they spoke Romanian. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">They didn’t -- the ones that I knew did not speak the Jewish -- the Hebraic language at all, they spoke Romanian. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And many of them, when somebody would say, well what are you, said I’m a Romanian. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Well, so I’m a Romanian Jew, what difference does it make?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  How did you learn that Hitler had invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the war started? </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Do you remember the moment that you first heard about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  Yes, it was in a newspaper, headlines in a newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Was Hitler invades <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and if I remember the Sudetenland, that -- going into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , the same way again, newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And of course the radio subsequently, but 1t was newspaper.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  You mentioned Chamberlain, let me ask you, what was the reaction in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> when Hitler made his deal with Stalin?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  At that time they thought that Stalin was a great guy, because they felt that maybe August 18, 2003 <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> would be our stalwart person and that would be against Hitler and -- and the German Reich, except that they had signed the pact themselves at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And my father had said, was very wary, he said it-1t’s not worth the paper it’s written on. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And he said, it’s just not going to be of any consequence. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And that’s as far as I think I could go on that at this particular time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  What was happening in your life in 1939 and 1940, where were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  I was in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">1939, four years of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> to 1943 1s when I graduated. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Now, I graduated in January of ’43 because of the -- the war, they accelerated certain [indecipherable] so we had two graduations, one in January and one in June. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I graduated in January and I think two weeks after graduation I was down [indecipherable] off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> going to Ohio University. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I had picked that as the <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Let’s stay in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> for just a little while.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  Yes, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I was a debater to begin with and we had considerable discussion of the political situation at that particular time, a-aside from the ra -- who shall own the <span class="DLF">railroads</span> , or other topics that we used in debating. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">But there were other groups, like August 18, 2003 the Greek groups that were -- to put that in context, like the Greek groups that are in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , these were small little splinters like the National Honor Society and other groups like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="185"><span class="BUILDING">YMCA</span> and the [indecipherable] and so forth, and that were very much concerned as to what was going on because we were approaching the age of which we would probably be serving in -- in the army or navy or otherwise if we went to war. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And some of my -- my confreres, including myself, were leery about the fact that we would be going to war. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And we were young, but I suppose that we got that from our parents, mostly and I don’t think that was an individualistic thing that -- I don’t think that I was that -- that intelligent to be able to fear that at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Youngsters at -- in those ages are -- you can’t beat them. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">They’re -- they can’t -- nothing is ever going to happen to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">It always happens to somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">So as a result, we didn’t fear much other than the fact that we might have to be going to war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  One last question -- I hope it’s a last question about your <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and -- and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">You mentioned that your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> was very multi-ethnic. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Was there a -- a group of students who were, you know, more -- no -- traditionally American in the sense that their parents were born in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , perhaps even their grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And my question is, did they see things differently than you, in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Your friends who were, you know, first generation Americans in some cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Did the people whose ancestry -- no, th-the people who were more American in terms of generations, did they see things differently than you and your friends did? </span><span class="sentence" id="198">August 18, 2003
QUESTION:  No, I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I think they were all pretty -- pretty much -- that’s why I mentioned the [indecipherable] and the YMCA groups and things like th-there -- they were comprised of the very same ethnic groups that I came from so that we all went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together and we all learned things together and we were all exposed to the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Perhaps differently intellectually as to the levels, but nevertheless, it was pretty much the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">We’ve had a 50 year reunion a number of years ago, and many of them showed up and -- that had survived and we lost -- lost some of them in the war, but it was interesting to see that -- the changes that had occurred in these individuals only physically, but mentally they’re still in the same <span class="REGION">area</span> they were in then, at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  So you’re saying that --
ANSWER:  In other words, they didn’t really move out of their milieu as far a-as that was concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Many of them improved upon what they were, but many of them did not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">QUESTION:  In retrospect, would you say that you and your friends were pretty politically savvy for your age, considering the situation --
ANSWER:  I think my friends, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">QUESTION:  Pearl Harbor, how did you hear about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">ANSWER:  December seventh. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Actually I heard about it by my father telling me that when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that we had been attacked by the Japanese [indecipherable] August 18, 2003 in the newspapers and the radio and the else -- everybody was talking about it, you know, but that’s the only way I heard about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  What was your reaction?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  Well, my -- ab-absolute horror, because it was unexpected, as far as we knew at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And the horror of the matter was that there was no retaliation. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I mean, we -- we were sitting ducks, and they just came and -- just tried to destroy us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">QUESTION:  How old were you on that day?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="215">ANSWER:  [laughs]. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Oh, not quite at that time, I -- I was too inculcated by my father to sa -- want to go to war right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">It was only after I got into <span class="BUILDING">college</span> that that happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  In 1941, in -- before Pearl Harbor and immediately right after Pearl Harbor, did you have any idea what was happening to the Jews in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">We just knew that Hitler was being very strongly opposed to their function and he was selecting them out, as I mentioned earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And that’s about all that we knew about tt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">QUESTION:  Had you been carefully following the -- the war news?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  Well, as I mentioned to you earlier, in January I graduated in 43, cause it was early graduation and I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">I had applied to a number of <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> and we felt that going within the state would be a ma -- more [indecipherable] you save a little more, but th -- and state tuition would be less. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">However, I didn’t have to have tuition, I was val-valedictorian of my class and as a result I had a scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So I had a scholarship for actually four years, but wa -- during the first year at <span class="BUILDING">Ohio University</span> , a number of us decided that may-maybe we ought to go in the service and- instead of just sitting around and waiting, that as it so happened, I-I was called up for the draft anyway, so it didn’t make any -- much difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">The thing that’s sur- August 18, 2003 surprising is -- 1s that when I was called, we had volunteered, and I was called to go to a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and -- and from there to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbus</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> where there [indecipherable] four days, and where they were gonna decide what to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">The thing that really troubled us a lot was the fact that when d -- I was -- went to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , my father and mother came with me and we went to the same <span class="BUILDING">station</span> that my father went to in the first World War and I si -- was leaning against a poster and he just broke down and cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">He says, I was right there, right there, I saw myself, he said, just going. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And I was an only son, I wasn’t supposed to go in the service, an only son. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Also had a perforated eardrum, which kept just about everybody out, but it didn’t make any difference, they needed to fill their quotas back in the old days, and I wouldn’t have told -- told them anyhow, so I want -- wanted to go in the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And the -- the thing that I remember so clearly was saying goodbye at the -- at that time, and -- and hope -- hoping that I would be back again at some time later. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And fortunately I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  Can you give me some historical context? </span><span class="sentence" id="246">What was happening in the war at the time that you went into the service? </span><span class="sentence" id="247">It -- you know, give me some background in Europe and -- and also the war of <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  Well, a-at that time <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was having a tough time because they were being bombarded and the -- <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had just developed the -- the -- the V1 rocket and they were shooting these rockets over and I remember that very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I was a physics August 18, 2003 major in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and I was quite interested in the -- that type of development. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">So I followed that pretty closely from that standpoint and then they developed a V2 rocket as well later, while I was still in the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">But the -- the context of the war at that time was that, you know, we -- we have to get into that European war because the ja -- the Japanese have already attacked us and we’re already at war, and that we have to go ahead and then do something just as my father did before. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And I think that was the attitude that many of us had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  How far had Hitler expanded in Europe when you went in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  Oh, he had taken the Sudetenland and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and -- and there was -- at that -- well, he was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> had fallen and -- and was in control of most of- most of -- actually, most of Europe because he o-obviously, yo-you know, he was- he had taken <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> -- I mean, not <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">That was a Scandinavian country and yes, that’s about it and yeah, he was in control of just about everything and he was now starting his <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  Now you’re in the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Tell me about the -- the training. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Where were you assigned, and -- and walk me through the t --
ANSWER:  Well, we went to -- we were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Hayes</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbus</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> and we left th -- th -- in -- in the evening, and naturally nobody is going to be sleeping and all night we were up singing and playing cards and just about everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And we got there and they fed us breakfast and then they put us in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and examined us. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">August 18, 2003 Th -- I mean, you had a -- an examination of -- of written tests, that were -- one part of it was written and another part was oral and then they had a test for sound, code, Morse code, the dot dashes and so forth, whether you’re capable. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And we were all examined and all that and then you were sent to the <span class="NPIP">places</span> that they thought that you would do well in. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I had a pretty high score, they sent me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Sill</span> , <span class="REGION">Oklahoma</span> to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there was an observation sound and <span class="BUILDING">flash school</span> , and we had it quite nice as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And some of my confreres that went with me went to the cavalry and some of them went to the tank outfit and to the -- the mule teams and- and also, depending upon what their capabilities were, or what they felt their capabilities were and whether they were intelligent enough to handle it. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And actually while I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Sill</span> and th -- learned that that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there, I actually got a minor in engineering because it was in engineering that we had to learn how to use a -- a -- surveying equipment, Theodolites and -- and the various other methods of -- of marking out <span class="REGION">areas</span> o-of importance against the enemy, that is. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I’ll describe that a little later, if you want.</span></p>

ANSWER:  I was a private. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">We were all privates, nobody had any rank in our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , of any kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And we went -- well, actually we were -- in part we were one of the largest <span class="BUILDING">convoys</span> that every crossed the -- th-the <span class="REGION">Atlantic Ocean</span> , it was thousands of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and our equipment that was given us, was as if we were going to be going to <span class="REGION">Africa</span> because the <span class="BUILDING">African theater</span> was still in full force at that time, and we had some equipment that was all -- and we -- we -- we knew that’s where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">We ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reykjavik</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Iceland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And from there we watched the skyline and then dropped down into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> we got new equipment and new things at a new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Actually, we went -- we were stationed at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cardiff</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Wales</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cardiff</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Wales</span> , then we were sent to the unit that would need you. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And our unit was sent to an <span class="REGION">area</span> called [indecipherable] in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Devonshire</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And it was a -- we commandeered a big <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> that was there and had nice <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> and -- and so -- and trained and trained our people there on the wartime basis instead of the Fort Sill basis, where I had the initial training. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">War 1s a little different than the books tell you all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So we trained there and then from there we moved on a number of occasions, as if we were going to go on invasion, but we didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And then they moved the whole unit to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bournemouth</span> , which is a <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> on the <span class="DLF">channel</span> , a beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And about every other day we would go out as if we were going to invade and we didn’t, and months went by and -- until June sixth, and June sixth the invasion occurred and we were still on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And we only landed D plus two, but August 18, 2003 we Started out on the -- the fifth and went out and -- and went in and pulled back, went in and pulled back. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">We were artillery people, actually, and the work that we did, there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work, as yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So as a result, until they had taken <span class="REGION">land</span> , there was nothing much that we could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So they held us back a-as much as they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Plus the fact that the bombardments of the Germans was pushing our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">QUESTION:  Tell me about those two days between --

<p><span class="sentence" id="331">ANSWER:  Well, we, actually we got stymied at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Lo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">We had gone inland that far and the action that we saw was getting our units in t -- into function. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Now, an observation battalion is a flash and sound unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And by flash meaning that there are outposts that are put out into no man’s land and you can have two of those outposts, generally and they look at the <span class="REGION">enemy territory</span> and they see the flash of a gun, and they have an [indecipherable] to take they can adjust on their instrument where that flash occurred and then they triangulate on the flash and they send it back to a central point behind, and then that’s pinpointed and those coordinates then are s-sent to our artillery and our artillery fires on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">That’s flash. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Now, the s -- the sound unit is a little more complicated is because they -- we sunk microphones down a -- a distance of about a foot and a half or two, in a semi-circular fashion in no man’s land so that the sound that traveled from the gun that fired there in the <span class="REGION">enemy territory</span> would hit microphone number one, before it hit number two or three, and in succession you would draw a <span class="DLF">line</span> to the microphone that was hit and then pinpoint where it came from, within about a foot and a half, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">So we’d call those coordinates and of course the artillery loved us. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">They said, they’re -- they’re our boys because they’re the ones that tell us where to fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">We can’t see a thing, yet -- un-un-until we have a August 18, 2003 coordinate that’s set on. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And th-those microphone, sound travels 1100 feet per second. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">As a result, as that hit the microphone, it triangulated in on that [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">We’d call it back and they would fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  How long were you at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Lo</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">ANSWER:  Oh, we were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Lo</span> quite awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">We lost our captain, Captain Brown went out reconnoitering, he wanted to see whether one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> over there was taken or not, and there was a little pocket of Germans that th -- supposedly it was taken, but wasn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">But we were stymied at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Lo</span> for a long period of time, and nevertheless, as he traveled with his driver the Germans came up and they shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">The driver escaped and was captured, and we -- we captured him back later on, but nevertheless, we lost the captain. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">That didn’t -- we were battery B of the 17" observation battalion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">QUESTION:  Then what ha -- you were there for awhile, and then when you finally were able to move, what happened next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">ANSWER:  Oh, one -- once we were able to move, we moved rather rapidly. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">In fact, sometimes they moved so rapidly we didn't have a chance to set up and the -- our artillery would argue with them, hey, wait a minute, once you set up, what are we going to fire at, you know, until we get somebody out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And we were the only unit in -- in -- in the V-corps, th-that <span class="REGION">area</span> , so as a result it was a little difficult for them to really have a target, otherwise they’d have to just time fire everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Nevertheless, the thing about it was that our -- our -- our feeling was that they were August 18, 2003 moving too rapidly. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">But we moved ver -- very, very rapidly and once we got up to the <span class="REGION">Argentan Falaise area</span> , that -- that -- that was the -- that -- they called that the <span class="DLF">Argentan Falaise gap</span> in which we encircled about six or seven companies of Germans completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And un-under those -- while there, we were a -- stopped because we had -- had circled them and the continued to fight down to the last. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">So we- we went back into functioning again. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And right about this -- this particular time we had heard that there was a -- another sound and flash observation battalion being sent from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Sill</span> , th-the 285". </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And that’s the one that had the massacre occur at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malmedy</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And that’s at the time of the big push that the Germans -- the - the -- pushing us into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> is what they were trying to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">The Battle of the Bulge, as they’ve called it. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And we had conferred with the eight -- 285" when it came there that they can’t function the way they did at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Sill</span> , that this 1s war, and that -- that it’s a different thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">But they were young, with young officers and young -- young companies and they just went the wrong way. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Actually, what really happened was that the leader, one of their lieutenants was going down the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and there was - the road signs were made out of wood in those days and they pointed the direction of where they -- you were going and -- and he said, now this 1s the route we’re supposed to take, instead of looking at his map and being sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Well, the Germans had turned the -- turned the sign around, and they went directly into the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And they got caught by the SS troops and about a hundred and some -- 20 of them or August 18, 2003 so, were massacred right on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And several of them did survive that we finally got to, but it was a pretty bad situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">QUESTION:  You mentioned the term time fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I don’t know what that means.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Oh, time fire is when artillery fires a shell and the shell will hover, essentially, over an <span class="REGION">area</span> and -- and discharge. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">In other words, it doesn’t hit into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , it hits up above the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and it’s timed so that it’ll go off before it hits the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and that’s why they call it time fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">It’s rather frightening because it covers a greater area of destruction than -- than the one that hits the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">QUESTION:  Did you take any prisoners?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">ANSWER:  Yes, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">We -- well, we caught th-the numbers of them in -- in small pockets, maybe five and 10 at a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">But the -- we were quite good with our prisoners because most of the ones that we took were old -- old -- old German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">They were not the young SS troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">If it were the young SS troops, they would not survive, they would have been killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">QUESTION:  Why’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">ANSWER:  Because they were the ones, they were the killers, and we all knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And we -- I -- we could identify them. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">They had tattoos on them and usually what happened was somebody would come along and say that we just got so many prisoners, but we couldn’t afford to have men take them back and -- and take care of them, because we needed tha -- our own help and our own men with -- our units functions coordinately August 18, 2003 that you couldn’t spare the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And if they were SS men they would go back with them and -- and if they tried to -- to break away to -- to escape, they shot them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">QUESTION:  What did you know at the time about the difference between the general Wehrmacht and the SS as you [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Well the -- the old army, they -- they understood a lot better about what it was to be a soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">They were not the killer that we foresaw in the young people that we met there. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">The SS troops were just unbelievable, just as bad as Hitler was unbelievable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">QUESTION:  This judgment that you have of them, was this from firsthand experience or had you been told about the difference in the s --
ANSWER:  No, fir -- it was firsthand as well as told. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I mean, it was the -- it was handed down from soldier to soldier and from ev -- and we really di -- we spared the -- the old German army, the Wehrmacht, the old army, the Germans, th-they knew they were captured, they were a prisoner and that was it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="389">QUESTION:  Did you have much contact with the civilians as you went through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">ANSWER:  Not very much cause we were always pretty active, but we did meet some -- some here and there, particularly when we were moving through some <span class="REGION">area</span> that had been cleaned out completely a | -- a lot earlier, like when we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , for instance, and we -- we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and we were -- actually we were -- stayed at <span class="BUILDING">Le Bourget Airdrome</span> , th-the old name, and we had leave to go out into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , if you wanted to, August 18, 2003 but you -- you had to go in -- in pairs or threes or fours because there were German snipers in -- living 1n <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and living with the French that were killing off our soldiers when they were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">So you couldn’t -- couldn’t go unless you went in in twos or threes or more. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And so as a result you didn’t get to see much of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> because nobody wanted to go out into something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">QUESTION:  Can you give me an idea of the route that you took from D-Day plus two to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint- Lo</span> and then take me through some of the progression that --
ANSWER:  Wow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">QUESTION:  [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Well, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> is a -- the -- we started in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Then we had the <span class="DLF">Argentan Falaise gap</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">We had th-the Battle of the Bulge. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And then we -- that was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malmedy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And then from there we went up and -- and crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> and of course I remember crossing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> very well because we captured the -- the Piper Heidsieck champagne factory and put guards on it so that other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span> couldn’t come and -- and get the wine and the spirits. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">That -- that was -- that’s quite something. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">That was quite something to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">They left it intact, they did not destroy it, because they could have. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Why they did, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">They even left the caretakers there with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">They had wines and -- and -- and cognacs and so forth that were aging in -- in these subterranean <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Casks as big as a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , you know, th-the -- unfortunately sometimes our soldiers would go down there and -- and get a bottle and then forget to August 18, 2003 turn the tap off, you know, and the -- course the caretaker would blow his mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">He doesn’t mind if you’re going to drink the stuff, but for God’s sake don’t let it run on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So that’s why we se -- we sent guards there and we’d have our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> go back every week or so and -- and come back with a -- a couple of loads of -- of champagne and wines and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And then it was distributed to everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">But up until that time [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And then we crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rebagen</span> and from there on we moved into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and I remember being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liege</span> very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And I remember that -- hiding in the sewers of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liege</span> during the Battle of the -- of the Bulge, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And during Christmas of 1940 -- ’45. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Couldn’t have been, 44. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Christmas of 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">QUESTION:  While you were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and also when you crossed the <span class="DLF">channel</span> , did you hear any of the Nazi propaganda?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">ANSWER:  Yes, Axis Sally was very, very -- she was -- she was something. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">In fact [indecipherable] we liked to tune into her because we all knew what a doggone horrible person she actually was. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">She survived, I understand, the whole -- the whole bit, and anyway died as an old lady, from what I understand, in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">But anyway, yes, there was quite a bit of German propaganda, and they used to drop leaflets on us, and even out in the field the -- they would drop, you know, your -- your girlfriend is now doing around with somebody else, you’d better go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">The -- the why are you here because you’re not doing any good. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">August 18, 2003 You’re just killing people, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">But there was th -- there was a lot of Nazi propaganda from that standpoint. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Everything, of course, you know, from their side of the -- the <span class="DLF">pond</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="425">QUESTION:  Once you got into operations in Europe, how much did you know about what was happening to the Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Now, you’re already fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">How much did you know at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">ANSWER:  Quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Actually, we got most of that from our “Stars and Stripes” if we were ever able to get one and see th -- we knew what was happening and -- and what they were doing and that’s how I knew about Kristallnacht and that -- when they -- they burned th-the -- they burned all the books and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">That’s -- you know, all that was earlier but this is what all recapitulated and told to us a number of times, was in our -- our “Stars and Stripes”. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And we of course heard it from our own commanders and everybody else that were there who were well informed on what was going on, pretty much. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">We did know that there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> and we were -- my unit actually was one of the first ones to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , and --
QUESTION:  Be-Before we go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , I want -- I wanted to know just how much you really knew and how much of it did you believe before you actually got firsthand experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">ANSWER:  Well, we knew that there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">We did not know what was happening inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , because even the people around those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and I can tell you that August 18, 2003 now because I talked to many of them, claimed they did not know, but that’s not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I think they all knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I think all the Germans knew what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">They were bringing in -- oh, excuse me -- they were bringing in people into these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> at a certain number and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> could only hold a certain amount, and they had to go ahead and get rid of that amounts that’s going to be displaced. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">So even if they weren’t close to dying, they would go ahead and kill them in order to make room for the new groups that are coming up.</span></p>

And you had been telling me that you had crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> , and then tell me what happened after you crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">ANSWER:  Well, we -- actually were going in -- into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> itself at this particular point and we were approaching a -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> and -- and that particular <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And the third army had come in to the fight for about several weeks or almost a month or so before, and they were pushing out farther even ahead of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And we were moving quite rapidly, at a -- as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And we were just taking the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> as they came, and as we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> , that’s where we came close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> was very close to the -- to this large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and we were told that when we were on bivouac there that there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp here,</span> and that it -- it was a camp of -- of political as well as Jewish prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And we said -- not we said, they said they would take us through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And there was a select number of us that went through and I had a camera and took some of the pictures that we have here. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And I -- I have to tell you this, that there was probably one of the worst things that I’ve seen in my whole lifetime. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And I became a surgeon after all this, and I’ve seen some pretty awful things in the <span class="INT_SPACE">operating room</span> , and everything tha -- injuries from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and [indecipherable] but it was nothing like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">This -- this was a -- a horrible situation August 18, 2003 that should never have been allowed to occur. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And as I’ve mentioned earlier, I -- the people claimed that they didn’t know what was going on, but you could smell the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from miles away, because they had <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> and they would incinerate some of the people that they had, once they died, and some of them that hadn’t even died yet, for that matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I understand that they were functioning at full blast when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was captured, and that they were trying to clear their -- their <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , and there were some of -- of them that were still alive, and they were just pushing them into the -- into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnaces</span> while they were still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">So we knew a little bit about what was going on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Then when we walked in to see it, to see that there was a -- a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> underneath the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> in which they had big hooks, like sky hooks on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , and they had bodies that were hung on these sky hooks and they would hang them there until they either died or what happened to them, and then put them on an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> and send them up to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , and there dispose of them by burning them. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And the stench, as I said, was -- why these people didn’t know something was happening there was beyond me. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">But they had quotas that they a-apparently had that said that they had to have at least 80 people die per day because they had to replace them with 80 new ones that were coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">At least that’s the smallest number [indecipherable] there would be more than 80 that died during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">How some of these people survived as long as they did, we could not understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">When we came in, there were some of them that were still August 18, 2003 walking around, but we were warned not to try to feed them or try to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">They were under medical con -- surveillance and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">But it was just atrocious and that’s wa -- that’s how I got these pictures that I -- that I ha -- that I took. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Th-This was still there cause it was still fresh. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">This hadn’t been -- hadn’t been cleaned up or moved or anything, and that’s why they wanted us to see it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">QUESTION:  What was the passage of time between when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was first entered by the American soldiers and you got to go in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">ANSWER:  Oh, I think there was -- it must have been a week or so -- oh, perhaps -- it might have been two or three days, or a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I really don’t know, because th-there was talk about it earlier and we -- and -- and one of the visits was scrubbed and I do -- I don’t know what the reason was, but then we eventually did go. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So it had to be -- it had to be s-several days, but these bodies, they wouldn’t let them just sit there all the time, so it had to be pretty fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">It had to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION:  Why did they tell you not to feed the prisoners that were walking around?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  Oh, th-the stench, of course, was overpowering as you -- as you walked in, but there was a large <span class="DLF">gate</span> as we walked into that, and there was a compound where there were posts that were stuck in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , and I understand that those were whipping posts, and a [indecipherable] somebody was chastised and whipped and -- and so forth on these posts and tied to them, and left there sometimes overnight and otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And then there were a series of <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that were -- were approximately 15 or 20 feet apart and they were maybe 150 - 200 feet long, and maybe 25 or 30 feet wide. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And there was an <span class="DLF">aisle</span> in the middle of each <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and as -- as we entered on the first <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> that we entered, there were still people in th-their <span class="REGION">area</span> , these were some that had survived, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And they were in their niche, as they were -- as -- as they called them, this is my spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Surprisingly enough, we also saw some that -- some women that were kept as prostitutes for the camp people. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And they were, of course, favored by the Germans because they wanted them to still continue to function. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">But anybody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that had anything to do with them was immediately ostracized amongst the people, from the way I understand from -- I talked to several of them for that matter, I talked to some of them that spoke August 18, 2003 Romanian and -- and they were Romanian Jews, and not political prisoners and they op -- from what they told me, you know, these people that were ostracized that way were shunned completely and actually, eventually they would die out. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Th-The Germans would -- would have them killed or -- or something would happen to them, or something would happen to them amongst them, for that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">QUESTION:  When you spoke to some of the prisoners, can you remember exactly what they said to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">ANSWER:  They didn’t believe that they were re -- that they were free, that they could possibly be free. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">That this couldn’t possibly be happening to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Their -- that freedom was the next step that they were going to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">They all anticipated dying.</span></p>

ANSWER:  They sent me to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Pennsylvania</span> and while there I spent a year doing nothing but graduate surgery, and surgeons from all over the world who were gathered there and I was the baby, by the way, I was the youngest one in the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And while there is when Bailey did his first heart surgery, at <span class="BUILDING">Harmon Hospital</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And we as students there were allowed to go out and ob-observe all the types of surgeries that were done within the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> ’s per view, and at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Pennsylvania</span> , Dr. Grof, G-r-o-f was the neurosurgeon there and he asked if I would help him on one of his craniotomies, operating on the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I said, I’ll be glad to, because I had a lot of experience in surgery from where I had come from. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And I was so taken by him while we were operating that he challenged me to the point whereby he said, I will get you a residency, if not right here, I know where y -- I want you to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And I said, are you -- he said, you’d make a great neurosurgeon. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I said, well I -- I just wanted to be a surgeon at that time and he se -- I says, but that means another five or six years. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And up until that particular point, you know, I [indecipherable] I wondered whether that was a wise decision to make, but I’m -- I dil -- I was delighted with what we were doing, so I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Anyway, then he was one of my champions as far as referral was concerned and I applied to several <span class="NPIP">places</span> that he had w-wanted me to go, and ended up under Jack French in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Long Beach</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> , the V.A. hospital, and spent five years there. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And in that fifth year I was chief of neurosurgery at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> because Jack French got married, and he wa -- August 18, 2003 married the diva Dorothy Kirsten. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">In -- in her day -- she’s the one that was thrown out of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , by the way, because of her attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">They said -- of her American attitude, that is. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Persona non grata, they called her. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">This was back in Stalin’s days. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Anyway, the thing about it was that he -- and he wanted to take a year off as a sabbatical and he says, you’re going to be chief. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And I went from, I think it was 9,000 dollars a year to 30,000 dollars a year as chief. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Wow, talk about living it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I still remember that very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I was married at that time and we had our first child there in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Long Beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And things were pretty tough on 9,000 dollar a year and we lived just a -- where <span class="BUILDING">Disneyland</span> was built. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And the kids in my youngster’s age group were asked to come to try out <span class="BUILDING">Disneyland</span> before they even opened it. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And so he got to know pretty well what the rides were going to be and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">But we didn’t stay there, I wanted to come back east again. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">The <span class="REGION">California</span> type of life was not my type of life. [</span><span class="sentence" id="698">indecipherable] as I always say, the -- there was always somebody running around with somebody else’s wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And it was just different. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">A <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> on every corner, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> three sessions a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Some of them were four hours apiece and they’d have the three sessions, three different groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Th-They were crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">So anyhow, I-I wanted to come back here, and I came. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">When I finished I came back here. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And the reason I did come to this particular <span class="REGION">area</span> is because before I went overseas I was stationed at <span class="BUILDING">Fort Mead</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And when I had got leave while I was stationed at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Mead</span> , I came into this <span class="REGION">area</span> and came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arlington</span> , and I loved August 18, 2003 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arlington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arlington</span> was just gorgeous. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Still is, but it’s -- it’s -- 1t was just gorgeous. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I said, one of these days I’m going to live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And that’s what I did, I came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">There was one other neurosurgeon here and we went into partnership together and everybody in the District of Columbia kept saying, what are you -- what are you going over there, that’s on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Nothing is every going to happen there. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">So the thing that happened 1s we built all these <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> and I was the founder of <span class="BUILDING">Fairfax Hospital</span> , the founder of Northern Virginia Doctor’s Hospital. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">The founder of <span class="BUILDING">National Orthopedic Hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">So we built our own <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> and we -- w -- and it -- 1t -- 1t was quite nice and had a nice practice, and I practice in what -- what I refer to as the golden age of medicine, where there was no Medicare or Medicaid and not everybody was entitled to everything under God’s creation. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">They got treated free in most of my practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Back early on, 40 percent of it was gratis, it -- it was free patients, so -- but I made my first dollar when I was about 36 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And everybody says, boy, it takes a long time to be a neurosurgeon. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">It does. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And I think it’s going to be even longer, they’re going to make it longer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">QUESTION:  How many children do you have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">ANSWER:  Well, actually I have three and I’m -- I’m in my second marriage, we’ve been married 22 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And she had two, so we have five all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And all -- all of them are out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , graduated, they’re all in their 40’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">They’re attorneys, no doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Lot of attorneys. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">One’s a judge. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">So we’re -- we’re doing very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">August 18, 2003
QUESTION:  What did you tell them about your experiences during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">ANSWER:  Oh my, as -- as they were growing up, they -- they know most of these stories, cause they would ask me, and I -- I -- I -- we would sit sometimes after dinner and just -- just talk about things in general, and th-th -- these subjects would come up. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And they’d ask -- they ask particularly about the atrocities and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and so forth, knowing -- and they know, of course that I have th -- had these pictures and they all saw these, so they knew that this -- this was something that did really happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">QUESTION:  Do you ever speak publicly about your experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">QUESTION:  In what ways do you think that this experience has changed you in your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">ANSWER:  I can’t say maturity because once you got into the service you became mature no matter whether you wanted to or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">I wasn’t -- when I came back from the service - | -- I went into the service as a young college boy that probably had a beanie on his head. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I came back from the service as a mature man that never belonged to a -- a <span class="BUILDING">fraternity</span> or anything like that, because that was a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , as we felt coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">So we set up our own organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">But I think that my entire wartime experience gave me a sense of understanding of what man can do to man. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">What -- what had happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> should never happen again, and I understand that it’s been happening in some of these other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , in <span class="REGION">Africa</span> and otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And that just recently Idi Amin just died and he was one of these Hitlers. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">He was -- and August 18, 2003 he was responsible for millions of deaths as well, and he -- he doesn’t have the notoriety that Hitler had obviously, but I think he -- the -- the people [indecipherable] know that he’s done this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="743">QUESTION:  Is there anything else that you’d like to add before we conclude? </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Is there anything that we haven’t discussed that you want to talk about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">ANSWER:  No, but it’s just been wonderful to have you ask me the questions, because it woke up memories that I’m going to be talking about for the next couple of weeks, I think, a-again. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And I want the children to know and remember some of those things and I think that’s a good thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And so I want to thank you for asking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">QUESTION:  I want to thank you for doing the interview with us today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">ANSWER:  Oh, my pleasure.</span></p>
