<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Yes, in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> it was very nice to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">It was something like I live now, like the children growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brandford</span> , <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I had only not-Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I had a few Jewish friends; and, it was very assimilated. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">The way the Jews really lived was that we had — the Judaism was more in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I mean we lived in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , so it was more in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and, and not <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So, I don't know how to explain it, we, we didn't go with — nobody went with beards or with peyos’. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Something like that, we didn't see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">But life was very nice in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">was not antisemitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Was no antisemitism, and my parents had a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">They had a <span class="BUILDING">kosher hotel</span> , and they had the only <span class="BUILDING">kosher hotel</span> in the state where we lived in. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Like <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> 1s all divided in states, and it was the state of Overijssel; and so a lot of Jewish people came to our <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> because we had also — it was a small <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">It was on a <span class="BUILDING">cattle market</span> ; and we lived — a part of — most, most the business came from the <span class="BUILDING">cattle market</span> , as is typical in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">It's not so much here. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And so we had a lot of Jewish salesmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">They slept over in our <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So it was a lot of Judaismic, and Jewish people came always to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And also when there was a kosher, wedding party or something like that came, that was always catered in our <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So a lot of Jewish life went on in our <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">My mother was very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">My father was not that religious; but we had to be religious because we had a <span class="BUILDING">kosher hotel</span> and that goes together with it.

QUESTION:  , and you went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> ; and then I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And the war broke out when I was not even eighteen years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So I finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and then, was — that was the end because right away we were not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We were not allowed to go work. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">We were not allowed to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">That was, that was the first thing what the German did in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , to take us out from, from learning and anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I started working, in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , because I, I couldn't sit <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And I start working in the beginning in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and cooking for Jewish patients. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">But that was, after a short time that was also was not allowed anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Like in '41, that was not allowed anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So, then I started helping all the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I remember in that time we had already a star — we had to wear a star. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And, I went to another — I took the star off. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I always was a little bit against. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And I took the star off, and I went with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and helped an older family, an older couple, what they were not allowed to have any help anymore from not- Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And we were not allowed to do really anything at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So, that was a very short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Also my, my, my father died on a heart attack in 1941; and on May the 10th the war broke out in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">The Germans came into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> on May the 10th, and the war was only five days. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I had two brothers what were in the, in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And it was a very nervous atmosphere, because we had a lot of Jewish people in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> because a Friday — from Friday or Saturday the war started and they stayed—there were a lot of Jewish people would stay overnight—and they stayed 1n our <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , and everybody was tremendously — was panicky. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Very panicky right away, and because they know what was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">It was next to the, the <span class="DLF">border</span> was next to where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">You know, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> is very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And so, they, they, they run away and some—we have a lot of water in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> — the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ijssel</span> was a big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and they left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">They drove them in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , and they went farther together; because they thought that the German cannot take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So it was a big panic. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And after five days — well, there was a lot of traitors in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> so the war didn't took long in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">After five days the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And they didn't start right away, the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">They did it very slowly on; because they know that they cannot do it like it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , right away, and in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> perhaps. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But they did it very slowly on, and very often — very — they did it in a way that no — nobody felt really that there was something going on and it would happen something, serious things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  What happened, with the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , or what did you begin to notice?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  In 1941, there was a club in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and it was a men's club. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Very sophisticated, for lawyers; and, and the German right away took that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So one of the head of the police and the owner from that men's club came to my mother and say, you know, "Why don't you go out of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , so the Germans don't take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And we take your <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and that you will save." </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And my mother was very upset, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">They really— my father died, what I told you — they really built that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> by themselves, really built it. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And to leave everything, just to go out what you have in your hand, was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So I don't remember exactly what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I know after many talking with the police and with this man, the owner, my mother had to go out of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and could just take with her—they talked her into it, perhaps it was the best-they could just go out of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And there was another Jewish family in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> what, had a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , very poor little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in a very poor <span class="REGION">area</span> , and, we moved in that little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">But I have to tell — yeah — it was already — we moved into the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in and in that little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in, and, and it was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">There was no hot water and there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and it was a very poor <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and I really hated it, I remember; and it was a very difficult time because, you were not allowed to go out and you hear the German already walking through your <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And also one day the German took all the people what went over to another religion, like there were was a Jewish boy by the name Wynberg and he went over to the Catholic religion, and they picked up all the people what went over to the, the Jews what went over to the Catholic religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So they didn't know — they picked my mother and my two brothers and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">My oldest brother was married. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I, I come from a family from four children and I was the youngest. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I had three older brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And they took us already to the <span class="DLF">German border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">But in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was a Jewish Raad’, a Jewish group of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">What they say they help the Jews going to, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but they went after it and they know that they made a mistake and we were already one or two days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  Okay, fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Can you just go back and explain why were you taken?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Because that was a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">It was a mistake that they took us because, they didn't know that the, the Wynberg, that boy, that he was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">They thought that we were it. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">It was a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And it — because we had the same name. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And so they sent us already — and always we had a little backpack staying by the <span class="DLF">door</span> because everybody knows already that it would be perhaps something like that happened, that, that we would be called up, so we went to that — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Enschede</span> was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Enschede</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">It was on the <span class="DLF">German border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And when we were there the Dutch Jewish organization, the Jewish Raad was there — I don't know how it 1s in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">They, they went working very effective and they got us back to my, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zwolle</span> , where I lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And I remember when we came back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  And how did they get you back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  I don't know, exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">They talked with the Germans and they told them that they have the wrong people and that we were the wrong people and that they have to have this other boy what he went over to the Catholic religion and not we. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We were Jews, and, and that's the reason, they got us back. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">They went after that they said they had the wrong people. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">But that was just a postponing of a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And so we went — I remember we came back and all the * Council (Dutch) people were standing on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and, and everybody was cheering that we came back and, and everybody came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and congratulated us. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">That's the reason it's so in my memory, that thing, that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But, it didn't help much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  What happened when you did go back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">We just—
QUESTION:  What was your life like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Our life was — we were not allowed to do anything, so it was very, very upsetting. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">It was very strenuous and it was very nervous. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And, and the men had to go already to, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> but I'm talking now where it's already the end of 1941, beginning 1942 or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And, the men had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And I remember my brother was — one of my brothers was hidden and he just got married not long before, and her father had to go a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And they starting already talking; they say, "Oh, when somebody goes to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> , then my father will be sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So you better come out of the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So my brother came out of the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> and her father — they would have sent away anyway — my — you know, the rumors go around. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">You didn't know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And so my brother came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And the men went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camps</span> , but they were allowed to go weekends <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ; so nobody saw something difficult in it, not so serious 1n it. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">They thought, "Oh, they have to go there for helping, doing things," and they came weekends <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So in between, also, there were things going on in, in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">That a young group of men didn't have anything to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">They're all — everybody what had a business was taken away already for the Germans and they put Volk-, traitors what went with the Germans—they put in these <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So the men didn't have anything to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And we were not allowed to go out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> after five o'clock at night; we have to stay in. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So these men, eight young married men, came together and played card. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And one of the traitors, a Dutch man, went to the German and say, "You know, that bunch of Jews sitting there and playing card." </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And they took these eight men and sent them to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So that was going on a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">It was a, a lot of Dutch, not-Jewish people, what were traitors; and you had to be very, very careful, to not to talk and not to, say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I tried to, to, to do something, what, what I told you I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Apeldoorn</span> and helped—and that's a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> not far from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> —and helped an older family, an older couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">But it was after a very short time also very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And there was not much what you could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I remember one day I was walked in my <span class="DLF">street</span> , and in the <span class="DLF">street</span> where I was, was a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and there was a Catholic priest lived in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And the Catholic priest came to me and he say — he start talking to me, and he said, "How do you think that you can save your life?" </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And I say, "The only way that I, that the Jews can save their life, is when not-Jewish people take us in." </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And, the same evening he came to me and he say, "I have a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for you where you can go. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And be ready tomorrow morning at five o'clock, six o'clock," I don't remember exactly what time, but very early in the morning, "with your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , and a little bit what you can take with you on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , and I will bring you there." </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And that what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I remember I say goodbye to my mother and to my brothers, and I never saw them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">That was the last time, time that I ever saw my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utrecht</span> , and I went to, a family — no, a woman, what she was a nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">She came also from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I went to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and, I stayed with her a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And that was very, a very nice <span class="NPIP">place</span> with this woman to live; what she was the whole day gone and I was the whole day alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And, then she had another family what she want to take in, and I went to another <span class="BUILDING">family's house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">A very large <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with, a lot of <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and I was there the maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I had to clean the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I had to, was not allowed to talk to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I was not allowed to go open the <span class="DLF">door</span> ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I was not allowed to go out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ; and there was no food in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and it was very hard already, food in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157"><span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> — they suffered tremendous in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">They didn't have, much to eat and they had, didn't have much, it was very difficult;

that with all these people I came with, that they were dead and — you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="482">So, after that we talked together, we got very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">They, they were very hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">They, we didn't get anything to eat in, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">They didn't work with the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">They worked some <span class="NPIP">place</span> else. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I was lucky that I start working with assorting clothes; so I had a chance to steal food from the, from the backpacks what the Dutch people brought when there was transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">They didn't have a chance to, to get anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So after a very short time, there was a German, German Jew, and he was a traitor. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Chaim, my husband, always say, "He wants to be holier than the Pope," this guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And he told the Germans that the Dutch men- there were seventy-two Dutch men in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp-</span> that they want to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">We never know if it was truth or if it was just a lie. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">We really never know, but after a very short time that we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> — and I don't remember have long contact with the Dutch, young men — I remember they had to go on, on roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">They had to, Ap— on Appell® and they — I remember one of the boys — Zeehandelaar was the last name, Maurits Zeehandelaar — he had a little piece of butter and he brought it to me;

and he came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp One</span> , and he went, with the whip he went in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> in and everybody was sick, had to go out and had to stay on the middle and I remember so vividly, was also a boy that I know from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Assen</span> , from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , from the Zionist organization, and he was standing there and, and they all was standing on a long time in the middle on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they all got shot, right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">When I — then he screamed and, and I came out and he recognized me; and I don't remember if it was Wagner’” or Frenzel — now one of the two — I mixed it up — he say to me, "Go back to work!" </span><span class="sentence" id="544">So I could go back to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Just luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Frenzel picked me out, too; and Frenzel somehow always picked me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">When I had a very heavy work — I don't know why -— just luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">He picked me out and give me easier work. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">We had sometimes to go in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and picking mushrooms for the Germans, some of the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I remember I put everything, the mushrooms, I put them in my bra and in my underpants, and when we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we cooked them in a little something what, what the Polish girls had; and then we had to go out and picking blueberries sometimes, but we were not allowed to eat them. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">So when we came back then we had to show our tongue if we had one. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And we were very hungry in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">When there came no transports, we were very hungry, because you couldn't save the food because the mice and the and the rats, they, they took away under your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="554">So we were very hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Somehow Frenzel, when I had very heavy work — we has also to go in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and cutting <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and bringing from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other, or filling up these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolleys</span> , what the people came in, with sand. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And that we had to do on the — they were the Germans, ” Oberscharfiihrer Karl Frenzel '° Oberscharfiihrer Gustav Wagner also the, the Kapos' with the whip in back of us, and they — we had to put it somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">You know, when there didn't came transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So we were terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">We are like animals already, because we were happy when there came a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> ; because we know when it comes in a long time no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , we go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And when there come already transport, when they coming, then we were happy that they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">When there came transport from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , everything went very smoothly. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And there came also transports from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and when there came <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , was — we were locked up in our <span class="REGION">area</span> and there was always shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">There came also a transport from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> — my husband will tell that story from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> , that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I remember that we got locked up in our things and we thought, “that's the end of us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="565">There was shooting and there was screaming and there was — it, 1t was very scary; and that was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">They didn't want to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , so they shot them on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And many times when transports came from, from Poles — Polish Jews, they didn't want to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> because they know they went through the gas — that they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">So they just shot them on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">So, it was also many times we had to stay on roll call the whole night because an animal walked on one of the <span class="DLF">mines</span> ; because Sobibor was with, <span class="DLF">mines</span> three times or two times and sometimes an animal walked on there — I don't know what kind of an animal — and then we had to stay the whole night on roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And we always made so out that, Chaim and I, that we stayed together. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">You know, he always made sure that we always — when also once what 1s that there was, some Jews ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Two Jews ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">They made it, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And we had to go back and we stayed on roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And Chaim, Chaim had — the men had to stay separate and the women had to stay separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And we stayed in Lager One on roll call, and they cut, they picked out every tenth person. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">So okay, imagine how what a nervous wreck I was — they picked out every tenth person, so it could have been Chaim. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Chaim was number nine.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="585">QUESTION:  You were talking about standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> and how they selected every ten people, and your husband—
ANSWER:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And he was number one — nine. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">He was number nine, and, and they were all shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I remember so vividly, there was one woman, and one man was number ten and his girlfriend or his wife was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And she say, "When he goes, I go with him." </span><span class="sentence" id="591">So she went also with him and they got shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">You hear, you hear the shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Shooting was — killing was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">You know, you live with the minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">You live with the second. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I mean somebody died or somebody could — I mean you lived in such a fear, every minute of the day, that you don't know one day of the other, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And, and every time when I saw Chaim or if he saw me, we were happy that we were still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">We were always together. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">They called us bride and "bruidegom '”," because we were always together. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">We tried always be together. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">So —and you know, I, I was like a tomboy. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I was always the only girl from four, from four children; and I grew up and I was the youngest so I grew up with my four brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So I remember that Chaim always calmed me down. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And he was always sure that, that nobody really knows us, that we went and so, you know; he calmed me down. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I stole a lot of food always from the packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And what was very, very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">When they would caught us, they shoot me right away, straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And, and I remember, once the they, they killed some people in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">There were — a group of men had to work in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and cutting <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> ; and they had a plan to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And when they were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> they, they killed some from the Ukrainians, what were also what take care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And they, they were Polish Jews, not Dutch Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Dutch Jews, they didn't think about running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Because we know we didn't — where could we run? </span><span class="sentence" id="614">We don't know Polish, and where could we run? </span><span class="sentence" id="615">So they didn't — but they were the Polish Jews, and they killed and they ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And some got alive out. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">But most of the Dutch Jews, they shot a bunch and they caught them and they put them, they brought them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And we had to stay on roll call, and we — I had a lot of food in my coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I remember I put it in a coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I don't how, how come that I had a coat — something over my arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And one woman was crying when her husband — it was a Dutch woman — who got killed and I know they wouldn't do anything to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">So I say, "Will you take my coat?" </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And she took my coat; because I know for sure they wouldn't do, they wouldn't look over her ' bridegroom (Dutch) if she would have some food when she was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And they had sometimes, you know, some feeling for the Dutch people. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And they too — didn't take me to look over my clothes, but they took some of the other people look if they had food with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">After that we had to go on roll call on a big <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and we were standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And again Chaim and I were standing next to each other; and they took a bunch of people and we had to stand 10 or 20 people—I don't remember the amount—and they had to stand farther up, and they will shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">They were planned to shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">My system was always— and was perhaps because I do a lot now when we see a movie where we don't want to see, we take it away right away — I never looked, so they shoot these 10 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">We had to stay all on roll call together, the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ; and we had to look what will happen to you when you do things like and they all shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I didn't look. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I saw them later that the Germans went again and shoot them again, that I that I remember, but I didn't see them falling. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">I remember one person seeing falling of that, that what I think I saw; but I remember that they went back and they all shot them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And there were all because they want to show us what will happen to us if we will do a thing like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Also I remember vividly that one boy opened a can of sardines, and they, they almost killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">His, his arm was almost — he was almost dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">They put him on a piece of wood, and we had to also trade — and the whole— everybody what worked in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> had to go on a roll call and we had to watch this boy, and that was Wagner said, "That will happen to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">When you open a can of sardines, or you eat anything from the things what coming on. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">That will happen to you!" </span><span class="sentence" id="641">So, I remember this boy laying there and we know this boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">You know, some of the things stays in your mind what, what happened to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I remember also once a man was standing and he did something wrong, and Wagner took a shovel and cut his head in two pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">You know, and I see him also standing there, this man, and then he dropped dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Once was a Kappa. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">He was laying in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> — a young boy from 15, 16 years old, and he was a very nice kid and— Pim was his name, I think, Pim, and Frenzel — Wagner came in and say, "Out! </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Up! </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Up! </span><span class="sentence" id="649">You have to go up! </span><span class="sentence" id="650">You have to go on— there comes a transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">You have to go out and work!" </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And he put with his whip, like that— out, as a joke. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">He, he was asleep, and Wagner took him out and shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">You know, your life was, was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">You know, that I think what I remember, I remember that when we go from work and we had to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we had to sing, and we had to go down and up. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">There was a punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">You had lay down, "hinlegen und aufstehen'*" it was in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">You had to lay down and you had to go up, and you had to lay down on the order from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">All punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">We had to sing very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Many times we had to sing on the inside of the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> where were slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">We had to walk around, in — 10 people together— like in the Sing Sing when they — and it was — I think I saw movies from the Sing Sing, as a child, and I remember always like a Sing Sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And it was beautiful singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">When there were already Russian Jews came, the Russian transport came already and also the Polish Jews; and we had to walk around and sing, Russian and Polish songs, and German songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I was six months in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">When I 8 Lay down and get up! (</span><span class="sentence" id="667">German) look back, it I can't remember that it was six months; because I was a long time sick so there was a big part what I don't remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">QUESTION:  How long were you sick?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="669">ANSWER:  I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">I really don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">But I was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">a week, six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Chaim always covered up for me, a lot of times. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And also my girls, the girls — the—Ula, Ursula Stern—what I did from the beginning for them when they was sick, or we could help each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">You have to have somebody what covers up for you in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , if not you couldn't live. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">You lived — I slept together with Mimie Katz — she came from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haarlem</span> — and Ula, where I slept in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So when something, we, we could help each other, that's what we did, so, after the — I don't — I, I remember that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> got bigger and bigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">More people from, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> — was a ghetto in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> came over, and we made big <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> — big <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> and we all were very scared because there came no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="680">They didn't come <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> , and so we didn't know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And then, when the Minsk transport came these guy from Ger— from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , Sash, Sasha, Sash — he just died not long ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">he came with a group of Russian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And I didn't talk with these, all these people, because, we Dutch people were, were like — they think did the Dutch — the Polish Jews hold together tremendous, and some of the young girls, had friends with the, with the Polish Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">So, Katty Gokkes, she was also a Dutch girl, and she had — with one of the Kapos she was friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">She was very beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">The German, the Polish Jews thought she was very beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And she had friendship with one of the Polish Jews and so that's the reason, she knows everything; and she could tell Ula. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">But so, when you didn't have a Polish friend — the, the Polish stick tremendous together. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">They spoke Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">We didn't speak Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">In <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , they didn't spoke Yiddish; so we spoke German but not Yiddish, so, we were goyim, we were not Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">In the eyes from, from the, from the Polish Jews, we were not Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">We were Jews, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">We were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="695">But we were not, we were — they they didn't understand that we didn't speak Yiddish, and they stick tremendous together, so when the whole thing from the uprising, we didn't know anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">The Dutch Jews didn't know anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">Ula was lucky that she knows this other girl that was also a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">It was lucky because of Katty Gokkes that she knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Katty knows about that, she had a relationship with one of the Kapos. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I don't remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">So, when there was already something going on and then they built very big <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ; so we went also, came in the big <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And I remember — I don't remember much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I don't remember much about it that I came to the big <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> ; but I remember what it was a little bit better, what it was in that big <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="704">There was a very big and much nicer, and I remember there was another girl — Viool was her name-that she came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> with her father and two sisters and they could sing very beautiful, and they were and they were always singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And so she got also typhus and she was very sick and she had also a, a boyfriend and he left her there. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">He didn't take her — he ran away by himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And there was another Dutch man — not a — from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , he's alive — Kurt Thomas, and he was friendly with Katty Gokkes. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">That was his girlfriend; and when they run away and they were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , he say, "Where's Katty?," </span><span class="sentence" id="709">he says. "</span><span class="sentence" id="710">I have no idea where Katie is. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">You should know. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">You should have taken her with you like Chaim did." </span><span class="sentence" id="713">So Katty Gokkes also died. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I, I, I'm — almost everybody died. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">But anyway, I didn't know anything what was going on from the uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">So one day — it was, it was very dangerous also. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">It was like a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Like 1n, in like there is a war, just a few people know about it; so nobody — there was just a very small group know about the uprising in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And one day Chaim tells me, "Try to get some clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I tried to get some boots; and dress yourself up." </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I was already a little bit better. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">It was — I, I was already much better, and so I — there is a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> — all the boots, all the clothes went to different <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , different <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> , big <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="723">The boots were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">The clothes were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Oh, yeah — one thi— one day — also, my mother knitted a lot and all my clothes was always knitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Especially when I go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , my mother put sure that in the backpack was all warm clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">And Ula, Ula Stern, was a big person and I was a big person. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">One day she couldn't find any clothes, so she went to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and she — coincident, she took one of the dresses what my mother knitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And she came to, came to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> ; and I remember that she had my dress on. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">I was very upset of course, it was my mother's dr— made that, so.... But, so 1t was all <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that were over, that were sent, that were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ; where they make bundles out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">There were other people again what worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Other people what worked and organized everything to separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And it went in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> what went back; what when the Jews came, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> went back with all clothes what went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And that went also, before the people went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , the men had to go and cut their hair; and that also went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Everything, also the gold; and, we had to separate gold, and many times when we had to assort the clothes we found diamonds and gold in it, and I remember once I found a whole handful of diamonds and the German saw it and he took it. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">The Germans when they went on vacation to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they took the backpack full with ger— with gold and with silver and with, with everything what, what they could grab; what was, what the Germans really want for the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="738">So, when you, when you found that you have to give it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I had to assort the clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And I was not so clever, really, that I thought about that the German and they take the gold; but a lot of people took it and hide it. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I, I always cut out all the clothes what I had assorted. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I, I cut it in pieces, when I saw that's the only sabotage what I can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">You know, to cut the clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And Chaim, and when I found something what nobody could see, I give it to Chaim. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">The fireman what had to burn all the pictures and all the documents what were burned in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> — Chaim, that was Chaim's best friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Szmuel was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And so Chaim many times put money under it, in the bottom and that went to him and he hide that in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="748">That was hidden in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , so I when we run away, Chaim makes sure that he got some of the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">So, so we, we— I didn't know anything, what was the uprising or anything what was, going— absolutely had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">So when Chaim told me try to get some warm clothes; then he told me, 'Take some warm clothes," and he told me that what the plan is to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">Then he told I was not allowed to tell it to anybody, absolutely— and that's my always and guilt feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I had a cousin there, and I didn't tell her; and the same day she say, "I will make some food," when she work in the where the laundry for the Germans and she had a chance to cook something. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And I didn't tell her, and she didn't come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And I always feel guilty that I didn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">So, I went to a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , and there was one German that was sometimes good. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">He didn't get also not much punishment, and he give me a pair of boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And I had a lot of clothes on, what was very dumb, because when the German would have seen me with so much clothes on, he would have asked, "Why do you have so much clothes on?" </span><span class="sentence" id="758">So Chaim told me, "On four o'clock be by a big <span class="NPIP">place</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="759">That is— and also the, the medicine, all the medicine the Dutch people brought a lot of medicine and that went also in one big <span class="NPIP">place</span> where, where they put the, the medicine, so the medicine was in that big <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And there he say, "Come there at four o'clock." </span><span class="sentence" id="761">So I make sure that I walked there at four o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Everybody was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Everything — nobody knows anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">Everything — just a very small group of people what were involved in this in this uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">So everything went through normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">I went walked — I don't know how, how I came to that, was allowed to walk there. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Anyway, I walked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I remember also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , once before the uprising, that I walked somewhere and I heard that the Germans spoke to the whole group of transport people; and I saw the rabbi and the cantor from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> , sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And I, you know, I just — I was planned just to run to them or — but I couldn't have done anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Also, many times I saw people from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">There was a little <span class="DLF">window</span> , and I saw people from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> passing this <span class="DLF">window</span> ; and I was afraid that they would see me, you know, I made almost sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Whole families I saw walking to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , many, many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And, and I couldn't say anything when even — was no way, nothing that I could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Nothing that I could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">So I walked to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chaim</span> , and on four o'clock, and I come there. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">I remember I walked in there, and one of the Kapos — Wieszubski was his name, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">He killed already a few Germans, and he was very nervous. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And I say, "Take a pill for it, something for your nerves to calm down;" and he took it, and I remember and it was bitter and he spit it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Says he, "I don't need it." </span><span class="sentence" id="780">So I met Chaim on the end, and there came — there wasn't — Chaim was not involved in the uprising, but somehow he say to me, “come there” and from there we will always go somehow in the <span class="REGION">area</span> for roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">So he want to be sure that we are together when there is a roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And there was a boy standing there and he was involved, he was in the uprising involved, and he had to kill one German. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Together with the Kapo, with Wieszubski, and he say — I was standing together with him and Chaim — he say, "I'm afraid to go." </span><span class="sentence" id="784">Said Chaim, "You have to go." </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And said he, "I'm afraid." </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Said Chaim — “there's no way back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="787">What we know already there was one young boy what had a chance to go walk around in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and he knows already there were ten dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So there was — we know already now, you know, there was — we know it is our death. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">When we, when we get caught now, that's the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">So the, the electricity was already cut off and the telephone was already cut off; so there was already, you know, was already not a connection anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">So Chaim had no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">He run <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and took a knife, put it in his boots; and he walked to this, <span class="BUILDING">office</span> where Beckman", was his name, was and in between the Kapo was already there. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And he had no choice, Chaim. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And he — I remember that he was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> to take '* Scharfiihrer Kurt Beckman the knife or something like that, and I didn't see him going away to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> ; and I went looking for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">I said, "Where's Chaim? </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Where's Chaim?" </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Oh, I got so panicky, when I know already there was an uprising and there was something going on there, and I couldn't find Chaim. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And then one of the boys, he say that, “I say Chaim is in that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And I went looking where Chaim was and I hear screaming, like somebody killed a pork. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">Was screaming, this man — the SS man was screaming, of course; and they were killing him with knives. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">When it was — we couldn't, we couldn't use guns or anything because nobody was allowed to hear, hear that we were — that they were killing Germans because they were all over, the Ukraines were standing there and the, and the Poles were all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">So I went back to the <span class="NPIP">spot</span> ; and I went, went there for the roll call because it was very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">I know when I was standing there when just one German would walk around and if an <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> would see me there — I know that I went back to the, to that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and was the roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">I went in the roll call, and then we walked back to the — then there was the roll call, and it was already a little bit unorganized. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">It was, that was already, you know, with the, the main — you could see already it was unorganized; and then we started walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And finally Chaim comes out, and he, he was bleeding. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">When he, when that knife slipped out of the head from this German and he got a cut in his arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And he was all over blood; and I remember I thought, "God forbid we come somewhere and he sees this blood." </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And you know, I had no idea what will happen and what will happen now. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">We're running away or just was very —I, you know — so, I cleaned him up from this blood a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">So in the time that we were walking, and I think I had a handkerchief and I put a handkerchief on his arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And it was bleeding and, and we were walking to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp One</span> , that we go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="815">In, in between more people came off, on all side people came; and, you see, I remember there were came a Ukrainian on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and they just killed him like nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Somebody had taken an axe or something, a knife or a who knows, and everybody start coming there together, what I remember; and then everybody say, "Hurrah!" </span><span class="sentence" id="817">or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And then we started running, and we were lucky we were running to the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> where the Sobibor comes in. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And I remember that then Frenzel starts shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">I hear guns starting already; the, the Germans knows what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Because in between that we started walking and I cleaned Chaim up, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> came. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And it was one of the Germans was on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> ; and the Kapo what Chaim killed the back of it, he killed already a few other ones and he went on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="823">He jumped on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and tried — and then I don't know what's happened, but he never came out so I think he got killed on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="824">That was an family — an older man. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">He had three sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">He had three brothers and the father was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">I have to tell you later that I've met the father in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="828">There was there three boys, all the three boys were Kapos, and nobody came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">Nobody came out of this, out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="830">So when we start running, Frenzel was already shooting and he had something tn front of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And every — it was a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and everybody stopped for that little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="833">So Chaim took my hand and, and he say, "Come," when it is no use that we stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And then everybody start running, and people start — and then we walked to this <span class="DLF">door</span> , to this <span class="DLF">gate</span> and everybody was falling around next to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">Everybody — you hear <span class="DLF">mines</span> going and people dropping dead, you know, on the <span class="DLF">mines</span> , and you only you didn't see much. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">You just run. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">You just run. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">I remember I had a necklace full with Jewish emblems; and, and I thought, "Oh, when I come in a non-Jewish area I better take that off." </span><span class="sentence" id="839">So I — that was the first thing what I took off and throw away. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And then I had to run and run and all the clothes slowly on. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">I took all the clothes off and I just had on what normally had on, because I couldn't run with all those clothes on. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">So I was running and running; and when I run I remember, when I'm very nervous, I get diarrhea and I had to stop all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">And I was very nervous, of course, when you had to run; and then we heard shooting already in back of us, and we heard, screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And we're running and running and running till we came — and that was dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">Went to four o'clock, five o'clock, started be dark already. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">We're running and we're running, we're running and there come away a whole bunch of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">We stayed there together. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">People from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And I saw also Kurt Thomas, and he asked me, "Where's Ula?" </span><span class="sentence" id="850">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Where is his girlfriend, Millie.’” </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And I told him, "I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">You have to take her." </span><span class="sentence" id="854">I say, "Yeah, I had to run." </span><span class="sentence" id="855">So he — Chaim was the only one what took his girlfriend, what took, took his Dutch girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">He was the only one from all the Polish Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">See how lucky I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And we run and there we come together with a bunch of these Polish Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">And Chaim say to them, "Can we stay together?" </span><span class="sentence" id="860">And one had a gun, a large gun; and he wants to shoot Chaim because he was afraid for me because I don't speak Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And, and right away they're, you know, they're afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">So I jumped in front of Chaim, and he didn't shoot Chaim. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And we went away, the two of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">We left all of them, and we went away, the two of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">We had — Chaim had some money, some gold pieces and some diamonds and we thought it was a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I have no idea how much it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">We both don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">He had in — where you put the glasses in — a case, he had filled with diamonds and gold and you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">And so we came; and he thought that and that was what we thought we can save our lives with. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Was his brains, not mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I wouldn't even think about money. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">So we went to a farmer in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and we asked if we can stay for the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">And he say, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Chaim give him a gold piece, a gold dollar. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I don't know how much it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">And we stayed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> for the night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="877">QUESTION:  How did you find this <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="878">ANSWER:  We just saw somebody with a light on, and we walked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">We had a lot, that was just luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">We — just the lucky stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">So I thought we didn't find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">It was just a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , the same day, we stay at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">We hide at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">In the same day, the Germans came and they went a lot of <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and they killed all the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">All the Jews what, what they could find, they killed all over; and they skipped this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we were in, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">But the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> that they went in <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in, so when it was started to be dark — I remember there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , of course, and I had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="887">We were hidden down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , and I'm still ashamed of what it was, it was terrible, 1t was '° Also referred to as Mimie Katz. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">Anyway, I walked in water and my shoe got too small, my boots got too small, so I took off my boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">I couldn't get 1t on anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">So I had to walk all the two weeks on the side of my boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">Chaim had to cut it open with a knife, and I had to walk on the side of my boots; on one, on one boot when I couldn't get 1t on anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">So we walked and we were wet and it was raining and we walked at night and I was very scared, and we walked through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And every <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> I looked “Frenzel.” </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Frenzel wore always in, in cape, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And it, and sometimes the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> looks like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">I remember Chaim say once to me, "Now you have to stop saying things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">You make me scared too." </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And once we went through a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and there was a body where we went through <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> — very big where we walked for days. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">It — and there was a body laying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">We had to — you know — and it was very scary, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">I came from a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and you know you come from after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> but still it was just — it was very scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">We walked at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">When it's turned daytime we tried to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">We tried to hide in <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , but most of the time they didn't want to take us. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">Sometimes they took us for money but most of the time not. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">We slept in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and we and when we walked near to an other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">We walked on the stars, on the stars; on the Wagen’”®, I think, on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wagen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="909">That was Chaim's part. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">We walked on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Wagen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="911">So that's — Chaim want to go to the farmer where he worked before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">Now in the war, he worked by a farmer; and he thought he goes to the farmer where he worked and perhaps this man will hide us. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">So we walked on the stars and we walked two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">One night we, we, we couldn't find somebody, and we were hidden in a <span class="DLF">hayloft</span> , in a <span class="DLF">hayloft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And we were hidden there; and little kids were, were playing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and they go, they climbing all on there and we were hiding under this, this hay. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Well, how much can a kid have come up you? </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And they saw us and they run off saying, "Jews!"; </span><span class="sentence" id="918">when everybody knows of course of the uprising so we jumped out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And we started walking in daytime and there came two farmers with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and they say to us, "Would you like to go with us?" </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And Chaim say, “yes,” that we go with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">So Chaim went in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and I went in the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">There were two men what belonged together;
