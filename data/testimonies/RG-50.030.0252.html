<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  O.K. I would like to begin by asking you your complete name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  O.K. My complete name is Eddie Helmwood Willner. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born with the name Helmwood Willner and the name Eddie was given to me later in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> as a refugee child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  When and where were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  I was born on the 15th of August, 1926 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munchglablak</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which is <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne-Dusseldorf</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of about 150,000 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Could you tell me about how the Eddie came about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  O.K. When the Kristallnacht happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , my father decided at that time that his son has to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> if he cannot get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and my father was one of those Germans who believed because he served the German Army in World War I, that they would not touch him since he was decorated and in the beginning they did make exceptions but later on it was all the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">When he decided it wouldn't, it would be the same like everybody else, he wanted to get me out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> so he sent me, they put me on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> where I was picked up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> by a Jewish refugee organization which placed me with a Dutch family. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And when I lived with this Dutch Jewish family, uh, I was of course sent to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I was told that I could not have the name Helmwood in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> it was too German and the Germans were still hated from World War I so they gave me the name Eddie and I, the name I kept since today, until today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  I am going to ask about the Dutch family, but first I would like to ask about the taking leave of your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Do you remember saying goodbye to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  Yes, I remember saying goodbye to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">When the papers came that I could, was allowed to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from the police, my father, uh, uh, had almost what I felt, we felt was a heart attack, but it wasn't - he was just over excited and uh he almost passed out and it was quite a thing for him and for my mother of course too to get me out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to know me on the safe uh side, and uh, it was, it was for me as a boy, it wasn't as shocking as, because I was too young, it was almost like going, being sent to an uncle or aunt in a faraway <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but uh, I, the only thing I was worried about was leaving my parents behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Because I knew at that time already what this was all about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Did they give you anything to take with you ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  No, I think the uh, uh, the uh, uh, laws at that time were you couldn't take any shoes, extras, I could take my clothing along. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">No, I, I do have a kidoscop, a silver kidoscop, that I took along and that was about all. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">It was wrapped up in uh my clothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Do you still have that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  I still have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And it was saved by non-Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  You mentioned your father had been in the German Army I understand
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Uh, which, uh, when Hitler came to power in 1933, uh, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> wanted to rearm, of course, and, uh, the military, uh, were, uh, in vogue again and uniforms and uh medals were being worn because Hitler wanted a new army, a big army, and as a result, by Field Marshall Von Hindenberg, which was the President of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , Hitler was the Chancellor, of course, they created the Iron, the Cross of Honor which was given, as I understand, to people like my, my father who had earned uh, the Iron Cross during World War I and who had served for four years on the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">In other words, if he had served probably in the rear he probably wouldn't get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">But it was given uh to a lot of people just because Hitler wanted to make it popular again that the army is great and medals are great and so on and to uh. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So, my father was uh, was given by the authorities a certificate with a medal which I still have to this day which was saved by a German Catholic family that he gave it to that had also served with my father in World War I. And uh the certificate uh I, reads basically uh - in the name of the Fuhrer and Reich Chancellor, which was Hitler, of course, given in my father's name, and uh, in uh, it gives the law that was passed to give this to people and I think 1t was a mistake to give it probably to the Jews but some of them slipped through. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I don't know if everybody got it but I, I understand there are other people got it and uh, it says the Cross of Honor for front line combatants, and the date on it is, the, the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muchenglabach</span> (ph), is mentioned on there, the 7th December, 1934. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And uh by order of the police president and uh, it is of course the swastika on it can be seen and the stamp that is on there and the city seal and the certificate 1, W 1 F.
QUESTION:  Do you have the medal with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Yes, I do have the medal with me too. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">This is the Iron Cross and this 1s the Cross of Honor which were, which was worn even on the uniform and sometimes in a smaller, in a small version of it on civilian clothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  And how were you able to get these ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  Well, my father had a, you cannot call it a wallet, but it is a leather folder and I happened to know the story of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">He kept his war pictures in here. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And, uh, the pictures, uh and some other pictures were given, and plus these medals were stuck in, he had given to this family and they gave it back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">The leather wallet here, it is very heavy leather, and is, the story is that it was from a saddle, ah, ah, it was shot from underneath my father during the war uh, and, uh, the saddle was riddled by bullets so it couldn't be used anymore and he got a new saddle, and so from the old saddle, he locally he had a little wallet made to put his war pictures in here. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And, uh, uh, and it says on there <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> 1915 near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Smorngorn</span> , so apparently that's where this happened, the incident, and that's all I know about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Except that my father didn't get hurt at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">The horse was dead but, and the saddle was uh bullet ridden and uh but my father didn't get hurt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  O.K. Now you were twelve, thirteen years old, went to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , and you lived with a Dutch Jewish family. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">What was their family name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  Their name was Leek, L - E - E- K. And the lady was named, by name of Wanda Carr. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And they were both Jewish and had two children which were already uh grown-ups and I lived them as their little brother and until the war started in 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Did they have to explain your being in the family to any of the authorities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">There was no problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  And between December '39 when you arrived and May '40 when war broke out, what was your daily routine?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  My daily routine was only going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to learn what languages and eventually I also had to go and see a rabbi to be bar mitzvah, which I never was, and uh because the war started in meantime. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">The family was not very religious but uh they did insist that I take lessons to be Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Uh, an additional thing uh which I should not forget is that my parents about six months later also arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> but without papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">They had, they were able to get across the <span class="DLF">border</span> with some guide because we were very near the <span class="DLF">border</span> my father knew a lot of people and some Christian friends helped him to get across the <span class="DLF">border</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  Did you meet up with you parents at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  Yes, my parents came to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> in 19, uh 39, probably the middle of '39, and uh, they did not have any money had to leave everything behind, they just had to walk across the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And uh, they were in a refugee status in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and uh, they were furnished a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> which was not big enough for me to live with them, but it was agreed by them that I would remain with the Dutch family where I was very happy uh and it was a rather large family, and, but I was able to see my parents on weekends. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And during the week too. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And, uh, till of course the war came and that's another story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  Let's talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">What do you remember, starting with ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  O.K., O.K. Uh, my father was considered a political refugee from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Now political refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were not just Jews but they were communists, democrats, anybody who had fled <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because of Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And when the war started, the Belgiums and the French, uh, arrested everybody that was German, men first, uh, mostly men, in some cases some women, but my mother and I did not get arrested because we were German. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">My father was arrested because he was a German and they knew that he was Jewish, but these were the laws and they arrested everybody that was German, and put them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camps</span> - not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camps</span> in <span class="REGION">southern France</span> - St. Cyprien, Gurs, Rivesaltes and there were several others. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Now at the time my father was arrested, by the police of course, Belgium police, we only knew that all these men were being transported to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> because the German advance came very fast and they had to put them somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">At that time we decided, my mother and I decided, or rather my mother decided, that we should go and look for my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">We knew <span class="REGION">southern France</span> , we had some names, but we weren't sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So we tried to get across the <span class="DLF">border</span> ahead of the German Army into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">At the <span class="DLF">border</span> , Belgian, at the Belgian- France, uh <span class="DLF">French border</span> , uh we were arrested for being Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">They looked at our ID cards, Belgian ID card, which were for foreigners, and it said of course nationality German. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We were arrested by the police at the <span class="DLF">border</span> , trying to cross, and were put in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Uh, my mother was put in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's section</span> , and I, for the first time in my life, was in a <span class="INT_SPACE">prison cell</span> , and that was one of the worse experience, experiences up to that date, of my life, because I was in <span class="INT_SPACE">solitary</span> so to say, I was all by myself in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , for almost a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And the Germans bombed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I can't recall the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> right now but it was at the <span class="DLF">border</span> , it was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vavik</span> (ph) was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vavik</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And, uh, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's section</span> was served by nuns and I got to see my mother only once when she was being walked in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">After a week, or about a week, we were all assembled in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , all, more, more, I would think, there were mostly Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> under heavy guard and sent to <span class="REGION">southern France</span> to the , which 1s rather large camp which later on became more famous because they put uh the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden</span> (Ballon) (ph) in there and other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">It was originally a camp that was created by the French to put the remnants of the French, of the uh Spanish uh army who were fighting Franco in there when they fled to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> they were put in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">But most of them they were gone by the time we came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">There were a few of them left who had not been resettled. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And we were put in the , which in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span> , in the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Uh, then the war was over pretty quick which we all know, and uh, where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">There were releases everyday people got released. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">If you had papers to go to some <span class="COUNTRY">foreign country</span> , the French were glad to get rid of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">The food was terrible there and people were, there were no killings, mass killings or anything like that but uh people died from hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">If you didn't have any packages coming in from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> there was a good chance you would die from hunger there. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And there is a very large <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> which I visited after the war, and uh, I assume that most people are buried there. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">There were no <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> , uh <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> , and uh, so, uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself was very, very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">It was muddy, it was filthy, it was uh full of fleas, uh uh and it was just a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">makeshift camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And uh so then the time came for some people to leave to be released, and uh uh, as we know it was the unoccupied zone of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and uh but the Germans did have some control because Germans did come there with the French, the Vichy police, or Vichy government officials, uh and uh, made sure that uh certain people are kept in there, but by that I mean probably German communists who were so-called enemies of the German state. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Now when it came to the women and children, like my mother and myself, uh they say can you go anyplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And we decided we would look for my father and it was also at that time determined that my father as in the which is on the <span class="REGION">Mediterranean coast</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I failed to mention that the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> 1s toward the <span class="REGION">Atlantic coast</span> , one in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrennnes</span> and one is the Bas-Pyrennes of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , so we said we had a <span class="NPIP">destination</span> finally; we said we wanted to join my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">We didn't know whether or not he was going to be released but he was there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  What year is this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  I am talking about 1940, late. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Uh, we traveled to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we found my father, and uh, through again some help of the French, but at the time we were all speaking French pretty well, uh, we uh, went to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auchtafa</span> (ph) in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span> , near in, uh very close to the <span class="DLF">Spanish border</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pier-pinon</span> (ph) which 1s the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and the people were very helpful, the French in this particular, very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and uh who were uh had a lot of vineyards and that was their business mostly up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And the French priest who was in a nearby parish had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in this little <span class="NPIP">place</span> near the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and he made his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> available to some Jewish refugees and there were about three families living in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So my mother and I got refuge there, then we went to visit my father and there were visiting hours I think twice a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">We went to see my father and, uh, this went on for a couple of weeks or months, and uh, during one of the visits, we didn't go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> - there was sort of <span class="DLF">visiting enclosure</span> with barbed wire, and we could sit and chat for an hour or so, and during one of the visits when the visit was over, and they said all visitors leave, the uh French policeman who was in charge of the group there, Vichy policeman, told me where, that I wasn't going to leave, and uh, I say well I came in, uh, I am already resettled. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">All he said I am not considered a child anymore, I am a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I was fourteen at the time, and uh, I was kept in, just like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">They say you stay with your father here, you're you're not a child, you're a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So all of a sudden my status changed, I was not able to go back and stay with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Uh - I was, uh, among a group of men, I was the youngest one among a group of mostly German Jews or also some, one German communist I remember and one German nobleman who had fought the Nazis who had, was fleeing from the Nazis and got caught there. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And he was later delivered, uh turned over too to the Nazis when they came . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Well, anyway, he, uh I was in another camp in and then a year later the rumors came, in 1941, 1942 I guess, uh this was still the end of 1941, the rumor came that all the Jews are going to be transferred to camps, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and uh the French of course wanted to get rid of us and the Germans needed labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Uh, in part some of the people were shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">This was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , this, this was just, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Cyprien</span> was just an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> , there was no work being done there, it was uh on sand, on a <span class="DLF">sandy beach</span> actually on the Mediterranean. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And uh, but people, people were being continually shipped out in groups and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> throughout <span class="REGION">southern France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Well, then the word came that's not completely true, some people are also being shipped out to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">At that time we were very well aware of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and concentration contrary to what some people think that some people say well we didn't know there were such <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , I already knew it as a child before I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , because people used to make jokes about Hitler and say well keep your mouth shut otherwise you will go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and on the Kristallnacht, and that is a story I missed by the way, uh, when Jews were arrested in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , uh, my father left our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to look after his father and was not arrested, and it was just a coincidence and uh, his brother was arrested and his, uh my mother's brother was arrested and sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau Concentration Camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Well, uh the uh <span class="NPIP">place</span> my father went to was about twenty miles from where we lived and his father lived in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> all by himself but his younger, my father's younger brother lived with him, and he was married to a non-Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And uh which is also an interesting story but I am getting off the subject there a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">She was offered to get a divorce from him because her brothers were in the Nazi party. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And she refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">She say, she said will stay with him in the bad days, she will stay with him in the good days. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And, but he was still living there, but his wife had taken refuge someplace when he was arrested and when my father came to his father's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , in , which is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muchenglablak</span> (ph), excuse me, they were demolishing the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And there were Nazi storm troopers up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">As my father walked in and see what was going on, the storm troopers were from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> apparently, not from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , there was a common thing that they brought in people from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , there there were no - but the Chief of Police was present, a small police force, and it so happened that the Chief of Police had been sitting in uh <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And he recognized my father right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">He said, Ziechfred (ph), what, what are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Was I looking after my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">He said, uh, well you're not supposed to be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">But he said nobody told me and uh so he took him to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">He said I can't do but arrest you. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I have to uh, anybody who shows up has to be arrested, so I have to take you <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> to your status. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">BREAK police chiefs and let him see his brother in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> who was later on transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and uh so knowing that my father had the Iron Cross and he had it too, my father always wore it in miniature uh form on his uh suit, particularly during the Nazi era, because he wanted to show that he was as good a citizen as anybody else, he did his duty for his <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and so on and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Uh, and he said, well he said we have to do something for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I, I don't see where a front-line combatant should should be in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> the guy said. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So he called the local police in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muchenglablak</span> and they ordered that my father be sent back, but they didn't specify that he be sent back under escort or without escort, so this policeman took it on his own to send, to put my father on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and say when you get back to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , you report to the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">He didn't send another policeman with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">My father never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And therefore escaped arrest and was not arrested during Kristallnacht or the day after.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  Let's back up a little bit to talk about Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Do you remember seeing <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> burning?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  I don't remember seeing <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> burning but I remember the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> the day or two days after, after 1t was burned, because uh we had to uh, uh, move out of <span class="BUILDING">German schools</span> into a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Uh, and the last <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I attended, the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , was right in the, in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> as the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So we weren't able to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">As a matter of fact I received a certificate from my teacher, uh Jewish teacher, only Jews were taught by Jews, and it said in there this letter 1s instead of certificate because the certificate was destroyed by fire, which was the fire in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and uh, this man by the way is still living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , my old head teacher from the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> and he is 87 years old today and I'm still in touch with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And he saved his life by being hidden by two Christian families in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muchenglablak</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">He survived the war in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Much</span> .. and came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">He had no children. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Extremely unusual, extremely unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">But I uh believe, I am not sure, that he, the people that hid him were fellow teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And the women dyed their hair blonde, to survive the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  The <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was totally destroyed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  The <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was totally destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Uh, there was an incident - the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> was apparently well liked and the anti-Semitism was not as bad as it might have been in some other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And uh the police was sort of decent and didn't, of course the Nazis weren't and the storm troopers weren't and the SS weren't, uh, but the police were sort of decent because they respected the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">But there were some bad ones too, but in general, the police saw to it that not too people were bodily harmed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  Do you remember other <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that were destroyed as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Yes, the <span class="BUILDING">rabbi's house</span> was, the, the, he lived in an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> was thrown out through the <span class="DLF">window</span> and we went by there on the way to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> on, on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> , smashed and other things, many other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And there were other <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> which I didn't see of course where they threw things out into the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Since we had one main <span class="DLF">street</span> there where there were a lot of <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , that was also <span class="DLF">street</span> very close to our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and we walked through there many times and all the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> had their <span class="DLF">windows</span> smashed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  What had been your father's occupation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  My father was uh, as a representative for a <span class="BUILDING">silk tie factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krayfeld</span> (ph) and uh, which is another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which 1s a silk capital, was the silk capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and he worked as a representative for, for this company. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">That was his occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Did he have his own business?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Not his own business, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  O.K. Now when you were at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> went with your mother. (</span><span class="sentence" id="162">end of Tape)
ANSWER:  .... NO way, and uh to continue the story about that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp, -</span> , when these rumors I started talking about came that people are transported to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , or to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> maybe to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> , uh, my father felt we had to get out and the fact that uh we both spoke French pretty well there were occasionally French gendarmes - these were our guards who were at the uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was surrounded by barbed wire and when these people did guard duty, some of them were sympathetic and every once in a while somebody would throw me a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">They came, there was one particular French gendarme who uh, whenever he was on duty I, he had something for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">He threw it over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , and I asked him one day if he heard that people are being transported. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">He says yes, if you can get out, get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">When he said if you can get out, get out, I thought he is insinuating to me that with him I have a chance to get out through the barbed wire under the <span class="DLF">fence</span> when he 1s on guard duty, and that is exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Both my father and I escaped when this man was on duty - he turned around, he walked away like he didn't see it, this was at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where my mother lived, and uh with the O.K. of the priest and with the O.K. of the mayor, who happened to be a communist, of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , the mayor and the Catholic priest worked hand in hand, an unusual team, but at the time they thought they were fighting the Germans and I don't know but I suspect that the mayor was a member of the . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">He was very anti-German and he tried to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And by helping I mean that we had shelter from the priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And he issued a phoney ID card. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">This was a real ID card but the number of the ID card was not registered at <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> , and he took a big chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Nothing happened to him that I know, but we were arrested later on based on that ID card, when Vichy police came under the guide of the Nazis, they raided <span class="NPIP">places</span> , they were looking for people, and I mean, also in addition they picked whoever else they could, particularly Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And during one of those checks, and we, I don't know to this date whether we were turned in by somebody, or the mayor was turned in by somebody or the priest was turned in by somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Uh, they also , | know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">But somebody must have told something, must have spoke something, either was unhappy about us or unhappy about the mayor or whatever was going on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And uh so one day during a raid, we were all arrested and then we were shipped off and they compared the uh, uh IDs with what records were at <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> and they found out they were phoney ID cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And that is how we got caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">From there on we were sent in by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> , which is the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> which was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">collection camp</span> for Jews from all over <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And uh after the war I found out what transport number I was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Of course I didn't know at that time, nobody was telling anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">We stayed several days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> , (cough) excuse me, and not knowing what our destination was and this was my father, mother and myself, plus the other Jewish families who were arrested in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , uh, it was on 12th September, uh, 1942, that our transport was put together and these transport usually a thousand people, uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , going out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , to the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">There were rumors where we were going, but not rumors that we were going to be gassed or anything rumors of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Uh, the transport that I mentioned and the date I found that after war because uh there is a book which was made uh, uh, published with the help of the French government and I think the Krazfelds (ph) had the hand in it and I have the book and in this book is my name, my parents, name, nationality, date of births, and the people that I was with on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , and from then I found after the war that our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was transport number 31 out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> , and I understand there total of 75,000 people involved in transports out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> , and, like I say, we were transport number 31 and that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> left on the 12th of September, 1942 for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  Tell us a little bit about the trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> were packed with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">There was very little food, what people had on them, and the only thing that I can remember that were given during the trip, on the trip towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , which I didn't know at the time but I found out later, uh, was water. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">We were guarded by uh Germans and in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> where we stopped- they had to get also food, we were given some water and uh, were able to empty buckets we used as <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">But there was hardly <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> for everyone to lie down. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Some people had to sit up all night, people were packed in like sardines, several people died, some people committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">In my particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , a lady doctor gave birth to her own baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And the child of course didn't survive; I don't know if she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Uh. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">There was a most unusual event in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Uh, being from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , my father was able to read through the cracks of the wood some of the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> names that we went through, so we definitely knew that we were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">upper Salezia</span> , which is now <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and which is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , what used to be the German city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , and where most of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> that we found out after the war were located, including <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and a lot of the subcamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Uh, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> were opened at <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> every once in a while and people were beaten up mercilessly and outside of that, people were starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Uh, people didn't have any food, didn't bring anything along. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Some people stuffed their pockets full of something and they ate it, but I don't remember ever having been given any food except that we were given water and in some cases people weren't even given water. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">So that a lot of people arrived dead or starved or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Uh, on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and again, I didn't know the destination at that time, at one <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in, uh, I can't recall the name right now, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">upper Salezia</span> , a small <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were opened, and they said all men out. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">That was the order. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">All men, working men that were able to work, out. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Uh, like I said, this was not arrival at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or any other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but it was just a small <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , and uh, at that time I had to make a decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">In the meantime I was going on 16, and I was pretty strong because I had worked that summer in the French vineyards to make some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And it was hard work so I had pretty strong muscles and uh it wasn't just that but uh uh the decision I had to make whether I was a child staying with the women or men. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I wanted to stay with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And I came out and we didn't know at that time what it meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Work meant able to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">To live. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And, but we didn't know what it meant for my mother and from that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> number 31, according to the, this book from the French government, of, of the thousand people or so, I think there are six survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">They determined after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So all the women and children went straight into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">At that point I searched for my mother after the war, and I wound up with the German Red Cross, or International Red Cross, at and they had a listing saying that all the women and children went straight into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So I assume that my mother was gassed right away on arrival at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> which was sometimes in September 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Uh, the decision I made to stay with my father was my lucky decision, and again, uh, maybe there was at the time a feeling if you worked, you can survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And we didn't know, we thought maybe the women are also going to be put to work in <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">But I didn't know the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> would be at the other end. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Uh, again, I didn't know about my mother until after the war, and I searched for my mother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muchenglablak</span> , and various other <span class="NPIP">places</span> but I didn't find her, until I was determined that she actually did perish. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Uh, my father and I were sent from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to a small camp which was a subcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and in those days these small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">subcamps</span> were called , which means <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camp</span> of the Chief of the German Police and the Vice Furhur of the SS which was Himmler of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">They had large names but they were small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in other words, under the control of the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Not always guarded by SS but sometimes by storm troopers, sometimes by soldiers, or helpers from the east which were in some case Ukrainians, or Polish guys, and frankly from my experience, I preferred the German soldiers who were guarded to some of the other people who tried to prove they were better than the Germans and didn't like the Jews and were very uh sadistic sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I'm not saying that the Germans or the Nazis were not sadistic but the uh first experience we have from these guards were the horrible experience and uh I always felt that I was maybe more German than they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">They called, so-called people who lived in the <span class="REGION">territories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">They were sometimes Polish, sometimes German, in <span class="REGION">upper Salezia</span> , and at that time they had opted to be German and some of the people didn't speak German that well. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Their Polish was a lot better. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And uh, the uh, experience we had, the initial experience was not very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Of course, the initial experience was the roughest experience under the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  Why don't you talk about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  O.K. Prior to going to a larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , we were in two smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was, I don't remember exactly the, I would say less than a thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I think in one case it was six hundred and the other one may have been a thousand. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">One was the camp of LazyL-A-Z-Y, which was mainly for the construction or reconstruction of bombed-out railways. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And we went out everyday to the, uh, we be marched under guard, to the <span class="DLF">sites</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railways</span> had been bombed by the Russians I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">In those days I don't think the Americans were coming out that far. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And they bombed two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> , whatever, and also building new railways, which was the hardest work because people were not strong and the food was very limited and uh, uh, the people were beaten to death on the job or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And the system was at that time whenever they needed more labor, new people were coming and being fed into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Supposed they had in the camp of a thousand people, they had a hundred people who died during a week or two on the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Well, they got a hundred more from a transport or from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or wherever they got them from to be sent in to fill up the <span class="DLF">void</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And uh, so we were also digging up unexploded bombs which, and, and this I did twice during my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> career, uh, which was very dangerous of course and the German guard would stay pretty far away in case something exploded. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And some people did get killed that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Uh, but, uh, railroad work was probably among the hardest work that we ever did because people were not strong enough to lift up the rails, and uh, some people got crushed under the rails, and people fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Our clothing was uh, uh, limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">In the wintertime we had clogs on, we had shoes with wooden soles, blue/white stripped uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">In the beginning we had our own with the Star of David on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Later on we got the blue/white-striped uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Uh, but it was very, we weren't properly dressed, we didn't have the proper food, and people were just uh walking skeletons in a lot of cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And a lot of people committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">This was the most, the most vivid recalling I can do about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , is not people being killed but people committing suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Particularly in one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that I am coming to later on which was the last camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Uh, but nobody thought they were going to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Uh, the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , uh, was like I said most railroad and then later on we were sent to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and I don't know if the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was done away with, but the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was transferred. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">We went to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and uh, when we worked on construction of <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> and <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> for the Batta (ph) Shoe Factory which I assume was producing shoes for the German army because I don't think we were used for any non-military projects. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">They were all always in support of the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">So we worked near the Batta (ph) Shoe Factory. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Uh and I was lucky in, I guess, in, in general I was lucky that I was able to speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I had an advantage over the other Jews who were coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , who didn't speak German unless they spoke Yiddish, and uh, Yiddish to some unfortunately, to some of the Germans, to the SS was like waving a red, uh, red drape or something in front of because that showed he's Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And if you're able to speak German, correct German, you got sometimes less beatings, or you were also able on the job to execute an order right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">You understand the order was given immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And that was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Some people picked it up pretty fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Some of the other people, if they came from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , I'm not just saying uh Polish Jews, but the Jews from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , and in the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> we were all Jews which changed later on through mix. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Uh, and uh, if you were able to speak German and follow orders you got less beatings, you were able to do it right away, and if you had a team, uh, sometimes we had to work in teams uh loading <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span> (ph) and we were two people or four people as a team and all of them spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">We tried to team up that way or working that way because it always worked better than shouting one, two, three or something like that in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And the Germans, being very militaristic, and frankly there is something I forgot. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I was grew up that way, to be almost like a, like a Prussian. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">My father was very great disciplinarian and uh, when he said go, I went, and when uh he said jump, I jumped, and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It wasn't like our kids are today. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And, but it helped me later on, being able to jump when the Nazis said to jump, you know, and to do things and understanding what they meant and doing it sort of a little bit of a military way. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Uh, which I understand from uh, from other people that I swapped stories with after the war, it is true in many cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">If, if you knew the German language it definitely helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And in some case, uh, uh, when we were building <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> you had to read the diagram, how to, into uh concrete, solid concrete you have to put uh wiring and uh wiring has to be wired up a certain way that the designs, if it is rounded and so on, and it has to be tight with uh, with uh the wire, the smaller wire, and if you're able to read the diagram from German, your job was much easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">You didn't make any mistakes. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And so on, so that helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Anyway, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , the second camp I went to, I made by first great friend for life, uh although I still did have my father with me, but a youngster of my age was a Dutch Jew and I also forgot to mention since I lived with a Dutch Jewish family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , I also picked up Dutch, which was spoken at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but Dutch and Flemish is almost the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And so I was very fluent in Dutch by that time, and I picked, uh, or he picked me, I picked him, uh, uh, a young man my age whose father and brother-in-law was also in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So we teamed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">We were about the same height, and the same age, and we teamed up, became very good friends and since uh he came with a group of Dutch Jews that arrived at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and it is a sad experience to tell about the Dutch Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Because <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where people eat a lot of cheese, a lot of butter, all the rich things, uh, the Dutch Jews were dying like flies. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">All of a sudden no food at all or very little food, no butter, no cheese, and uh the Dutch Jews within a short, the shortest period of time, there were very few left. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I don't, I think we did receive one time a group of two hundred Jews and within a matter of six weeks they were down to maybe fifty or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I don't know exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Because uh, it was much harder on them, whereas the Jew from the East, a Polish Jew family who had always had a hard life, where lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> maybe and who was poor, and didn't have all the rich foods, he was able to resist much better in a concentrate, for a longer period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">In the end it was all the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">But uh, uh, that was a big difference with a Jew from the West and a Jew from the East - the survival rate. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Uh, a Jew from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was toughened up, or a Russian Jew or whoever they had from the, the <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So in that respect I think, uh, there was greater survival rate among the eastern European Jews than the western European Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">But the Dutch Jews were particularly badly hit because of their life style that they had before. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So I teamed up with this boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">At the time probably more so than his family, his father and his brother-in-law were killed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and I must tell this story because Mike Swab (ph) was his name, my best friend, Mike, who unfortunately died in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> two years ago of cancer, and we were the best of friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">As a matter of fact we're like brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And uh, Mike Swab's father and brother were killed by cold water shower. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">The team was, came back from work one day where there were a lot of Dutch Jews and they were lined up in the <span class="DLF">camp street</span> , and they had said that they did not perform their job properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">They were sabotaging the German war effort, the Dutch Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And they took all these Jews who were in that particular group that came back from work and hosed them down - they call it hosing down. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">By that they took a fire hose in the middle of the winter, and this must have been 1942, to 43 the winter, and uh hosed the people the people had to stand at attention and they actually froze to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">This is, this is a winter not like here but uh a Polish winter you are talking about now. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">A eastern European winter, with snow on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , leaving people <span class="NPIP">outside</span> all night and by morning most of them were frozen to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And that was the end of Mike Swab's father and brother-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So from then on, we just became brothers and uh my father was of course still alive but uh, we then teamed up as a team and, at work, Mike knew German quite well, because first of all Dutch and German 1s very close and he picked it up very fast; he knew some before. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Mike came from a rather large family and all of his family was wiped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">This is another story for after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">But uh, we could not have been closer because in everything we just ticked, we just, he had the same ideas about how to survive and our main idea was to be able to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And I said here I have somebody who's, maybe my father won't be able to make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I knew at that time he was getting weaker but he was pretty good at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">So I said if we're going to make it, the young people are going to make it and uh, we then decided, in actual words I think you could almost say we made a pact, that we're going to stick it out together. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">We talked about it and then said we just have to help each other the best way we can. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">If you find some food, you share it with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I find some extra food, I share 1t with you and it has to be complete honesty and none, none of this taking away from the <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Many times it feels people come like beasts sometimes when they are hungry, and uh, become dehumanized. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And we're not become, we're not going to become dehumanized. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We're going to remain the way we came as much as possible and we're going to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Never to leave that idea behind that we're not going to make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">We are going to make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And uh, that was the singlest biggest thing in my life, I'm sure his life, that uh, that made me so live, plus a lot of luck, plus a lot of faith, plus a lot of other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">But I think that the, think the idea that uh, we're going to make it by escaping or some other way, uh, made us stay alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Now, Mike Swab then uh moved fortunately for me and for him I think, that when we move from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we always stick together. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">His number, uh that was tattooed on his arm was just a few away from me and which was given to us later, not in the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> but when we moved to the subcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And uh, we uh, the bond was even stronger because I felt also that he had lost his father, on my part at least, he doesn't have a father or brother, he is all by himself, and I still have my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Although my father did work in a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but at nighttime we saw each other in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And we were also able to help each other out by uh, for instance in this particular case, I had to hold the measuring equipment for a German which is a, a surveyor of uh, uh, on a, a <span class="DLF">construction site</span> , on a <span class="DLF">railroad site</span> , you had what these guys they call mister ,or , which 1s a supervisor and sometimes, because I spoke German, he left a piece of bread or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And then I would take it back and share it with my friend Mike and my father or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But there was a little help every once in a while if you were lucky and if you were maybe away from the big group which I was at times. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And uh, when we were transferred to the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> with Mike Swab, of course, we teamed up, uh, filling <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span> (ph), and they have a name for that, auch ; which I don't know if there is a name in English, means in working, you fill your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorry</span> and then if the others are finished, you can rest up. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">In other words, you don't have to fill another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorry</span> (ph) because there are two people to each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">You throw the dirt in, and then some other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and you unload it, and you fill <span class="DLF">holes</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Or bunk craters or whatever we did there (mumbled). </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And uh, uh Mike and I were probably among the best team there was, uh, and the reward for being good was not food but it was ciga - one cigarette a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">These were Russian mahorka (ph) cigarettes which had been either captured or gotten from the Soviet Union; they weren't real tobacco, but to the smoker this was better than nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And there were people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> who would give their bread away instead of (mumble) rather not eat than smoke a cigarette. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And that's how we traded. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">There was a trade going on among the people who were smokers and who rather would die smoking, not from cancer but from not eating, and would give a piece of their bread away just to have a .... TAPE ENDS ... that they, because they were's always the same, whether he was a uh, uh, a bad or good, shouldn't say good guy because there weren't many good guys, most of them were bad, but occasionally there was one who probably had regrets having joined the SS or, and we had one who actually spoke Yiddish, who apparently had lived with Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Some people suspected him maybe partly Jewish, but we never determined that and he disappeared later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Maybe he was found out, but uh he did speak Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And uh, uh, it was also question of survival who your guard was that particular day. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">So if you were lucky maybe for many weeks you had the right guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Somebody came along he just hated you for being able to speak German as well as he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Or maybe better. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">If he was a guard who came from some <span class="REGION">territory</span> which are the uh, uh - I can't think of name right now - ethnic Germans, who were transported back into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , came from the Sudanan (ph) land. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And some of these people did not speak so well German, so here you have a guard whose German was not so good, but a prisoner, a Jew, spoke better German than he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And that was of course cause for taking it out on somebody, and, and that was very frequent, very frequent. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">But it didn't have to be the language, there were many other things this happened to. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Pause. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Uh, in the uh, digging up of bombs, uh, we were all so lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I'm speaking very frequently about luck because uh, the survival is part the luck, staying healthy and a, a number of other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">But the luck part was that in my team, this again I'm talking about teams (mumbled) in someplace you were work as team, a team of five people there were digging up bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">We had an form (ph) engineer, a Jew who knew how to defuse bombs, who learned it apparently in there, and in other teams which just had to be somebody in the team of five people to dig up bombs who had to defuse the bomb and some of them went off. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So our case in a team that dug up the bombs, we had an engineer that knew what he was doing and we never had an explosion. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">So again, luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And uh, uh, what can, else can I contribute to, faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Yes, I'll speak about that now. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Uh, I came from a Jewish family which went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on holidays, and on Sabbath evening, but not orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">We had a <span class="BUILDING">conservative synagogue</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the only one, and it was a city of about 800 Jews I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Middle class mostly, and uh, uh, I'm getting off the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">QUESTION:  MUMBLED -
ANSWER:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Things I think of I want to say, not about faith, but uh about how I met my wife later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Uh, I married a, I married a non-Jewish woman, a German, but she comes from a non*Nazi family. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I, I, her uncle was the uh, president of the German Jewish Friendship Society, he was a former German professor, and he was the Senator for Cultural (ph) Education in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Uh and, uh, so I, I knew this when I met her, and wanted to marry somebody as a friend of my did, a Jewish boy, a rabbi's son, who married a woman who comes from a big Nazi family, and the family didn't even want to have anything to do with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">But uh, uh, my wife wanted to become Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I said for you believe whatever you want to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">That's the way I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I'm not sure I believe everything that the Jew does - I believe what I want - that's the way I came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And, uh, but my wife said but my children are educated as Jews, but according to the law, they are not Jewish and I know that because their mother has to be Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And to me this means absolutely nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">My children feel as Jews, they're educated, they go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , some of them, not all. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Like all the other Jewish kids too. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">But uh, they went to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Sunday School</span> for ten years, every one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">They are always the top ones in their class, and so I have, don't have a problem with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">To me, conversion means nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I have seen so many people being converted by militant chap _ that didn't deserve to be converted. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Just because, for the in-laws, or ...
QUESTION:  You were talking before about how your faith helped you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">We're not on yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">We are on. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Oh, I didn't know that, I didn't realize that. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">O.K. Anyway, I started talking about my faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Now, I mentioned that I, uh, we belonged to <span class="BUILDING">conservative synagogue</span> which was the only one in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And we had an outstanding rabbi there. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Was quite impressive man. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And so I had a good Jewish education. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in the, in the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , you also get lessons of religion, and so the Jews are, just like here you may have to, but you do it here on a Sunday, or, or you don't do it in a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , you go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to your <span class="BUILDING">church</span> to get religious lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">But in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , it's part of the curriculum that once or twice or three times a week you have an hour on Judaism, or Catholicism or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And so uh, I grew up, to make a long story short, to be with a solid Jewish education, a little Hebrew, and, but, I was not, neither was my father, very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">My grandparents were, on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And uh, so, my faith, that I want to talk about, I lost towards the end of the war, my faith in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I say how can there be a God, and I was not thinking about myself, or this was even before my father was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Uh, I lost my faith because I say how can God allow that little children and women be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And uh, I kept this for about a year after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And then I felt I came back not because somebody tried to convince me there is a god, all by myself I said there has to be something superior, but I will never call him almighty again, because if he was almighty, he could have prevented that. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">So I don't believe that God 1s almighty. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I do believe in architect of the universe, call him God, call him what you will, I do believe in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">But, uh, and my children believe in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Uh, and I, these questions I have talked extensively, uh, to my children about and I told them they are free to believe whatever they want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">They grew up with a Jewish education, and the reason, I didn't point this out before, why I wanted to be Jewish and that was a question that uh, came up with, between me and my wife before we got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I said, look, you are protestant and uh, I'm Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Now, I am not very strong on Judaism, but the children, we have to decide when we have children, what they will be. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">So, I said whatever you want them to be 1s alright with me, and she said, I said, I don't feel either way. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">So I decided the children would be Jewish with the agreement of my wife, for one reason only. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">In the memory of my parents, because my parents had to die because they were Jews, and, in their memory, the children are going to be Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">If it had to be one way or another, it had to be some reason why they're one way or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So my wife fully agreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And my wife, after several years, wanted also to become Jewish, and I said this means nothing to me - it's a piece of paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">You'll continue living just the way we do now - it means nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And as far as the children, they can feel, they grew up with ten years of Jewish education and know all there is to know, and they can do whatever they want. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And, uh, I give them that freedom, because I am not myself so strong on, on religion, but I do believe in God and it came back to me after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Because I really had a hard time for a long time, and while I was in the U.S. Army I had a very deep uh, talk with a Catholic chaplain. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And, about faith, and he was the only man that ever admitted to me, the only preacher that said if he had experienced some of the things, we had many evenings together, that he had experienced some of the things that I talked to him about, that he wasn't sure he could still believe in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And that comes from a Catholic priest in the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Anyway, that's, I mentioned religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Uh, if religion is a strong support for people, I recommend religion, one or another religion, as long as you have some belief in something, in God, or in your fellow man. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">To me, I look at my parents as being godly. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">They were good people, they died, they had never done anything wrong, and to me that, I see God in them. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And I can see God in other people, live people. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">They are good people. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I see God in nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">So I can consider myself as believing in God, although at, for, for a while, for me about two years, I didn't believe in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">This was one year after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Uh, the belief to survive I talked about. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">O.K., one was religion or the belief in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">One was luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Health was of utmost importance. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Even if you had enough to eat didn't mean that you were able to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Because there were so many diseases. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">There was typhus in <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Diarrhe
ANSWER:  The worst enemy that I, that I have seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Once you had it, you couldn't get rid of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And, fortunately, in some of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and I am getting back to the story later on more extensively, you had many Jewish doctors, who weren't allowed to practice medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">There was no <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , but who recommended certain ways of keeping yourself fit, even without, with little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">For instance, in the case of diarrhea, we took wood that was burned and ground it up and ate the ashes, uh, the coal actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">The coal, and that is one thing that will help you in preventing diarrhea, or if you have diarrhea maybe you can get rid of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">So from coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">So there were many very primitive ways that we used, or even chewing on a piece of wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Just to kill the feeling of hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">So, and, and, and like I said the doctors were very helpful in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , even though they weren't allowed to practice, with that advice. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And uh, so, uh, disease was the big killer and if you were able to survive that you were lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Now uh, while I'm thinking of it, my, uh when I escaped later on, my weight, I was uh put on the scale by the U.S. Army and was seventy-five pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I was a walking skeleton, but I was healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And that was my luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Uh, just skin and bones, but walking and still fairly strong, and weighed seventy-five American pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And so was my friend Mike Schwab about the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And we picked it up, about fifty pounds in six months, in three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">But uh, from the smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that I was talking about, we went to a larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blechhammer</span> (ph) and this was an actual small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of about four thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">When I say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> I must make the difference between a camp like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and this was a subcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> had something like I believe maybe a hundred subcamps, some smaller, some bigger, and this one four thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And these subcamps were mainly used not for the destruction of people but for work people to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">That was the point in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="448">They were used for the German war effort in most cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">In this particular case, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blechhammer</span> (ph) was a camp that was about I think maybe a hundred kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , maybe less, I don't know exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And it had the largest German synthetic gas factory, which was several miles long, wide, and everyday we went to work in this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Now, the, the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">gasoline factory</span> was being bombed once by American long-range bombers. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And I must as a <span class="DLF">side-line</span> state something. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I was very upset for a long time when the question came up in the newspapers about the bombing of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , that it couldn't be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">It was too far. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Well, we were just, I would say within fifty miles of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And we were being bombed by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American bombers</span> , which was something happy event for us although some prisoners got killed, and in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , where we did also mostly construction work. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">We didn't actually participate in the operation of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">These were Germans or other foreigners. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And they had also British prisoner of war camp nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Uh, the uh, uh, we were mainly used to clean up from the bombings. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">We built and built new <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> where the Germans could hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Now when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> came overhead, there were several bombing raids who dropped what they call, uh carpet bombings. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">That means releasing, a hundred <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> releasing all the bombs at one time for effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And they tried to destroy the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in order to prevent the Germans from having gasoline to continue the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Uh, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was, like I said, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> and not a camp with <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">The people, and I didn't know this at the time, only when they came to my father which I'm going to talk about in a minute, the people were not destroyed in <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> there because that was done at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And we were there for one purpose, to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">We worked to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">The food was so so but compared to the previous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> it was a little better because they really needed us very badly there. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">But there was uh, one meal in the morning and one meal at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And if you're lucky, there was some soup at lunch time at the place of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And working hours were usually, and this was true for most of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , were anywhere from ten to twelve hours average day. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And the facilities for hygiene were very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I didn't touch on that in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and the common latrines and the people had diarrhea like I mentioned before and uh, and people would catch bugs one from one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">The water was someplace on, the cold water. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And anyway, the Blechhammer (ph) camp uh was probably one of the more modern or well-kept camps because the camp commander and the Jew which was the uh Jewish guy in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">One of the prisoners was not a copple (ph) which was so bad, but he was also was a winner of a German medal during the First World War and was somewhat respected by the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And he was a learned man and his name was Klemper, Kempor or Kemora (ph) was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And because of him I think uh, uh a lot of people, not a lot of people, but the, the lifestyle was somewhat more decent than in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Uh, we were not bothered too much while we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">We had to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Uh, people were sometimes beaten to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">It was up to the local SS who guarded us. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Or even to some of the German, uh, to the uh fuabata(ph) who were sometimes pretty bad guys who knew that it doesn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">You kill one prisoner they got replacement ones pretty quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Now at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blechhammer</span> , it was a replacement, uh, uh, the replacement worked this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Ifa hundred prisoners, or two hundred or three hundred prisoners had died over a period of time, a short period of time, two or three hundred prisoners would come in from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> immediately, which wasn't very far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">So they could work people to death and then the bodies, I don't even know what they did with the bodies, whether they were taken to a <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or not or whether they were taken care of locally. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I really don't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">But whenever there were prisoners missing, they just brought a couple hundred more. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And this was true also in the last <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Uh, exactly the same method of replenishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Uh, with my father in, this happened in about uh, I don't know exactly but uh, November or so of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">My father became very weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Uh, was also like a skeleton and uh, he was reaching the age of 50. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">He was going to have, and uh, at that time there was unwritten rule, and I've checked it out after the war, this, there was someplace there was something in writing, and someplace there was nothing, I don't know the sit was___, but it was an accepted fact that any Jew or any worker, non- Jewish, who worked in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> , uh, who reached the age of 50 was not good enough for the war effort of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Therefore, he was disposed of. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Disposal meant <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> if they have one. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">In our case <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">So what they did ever once in a while, they picked up the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Some people said I can't, I'm weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Well the SS picked them out or they picked out older people. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">But there was always a group of people that was sent back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blechhammer</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">But whoever reached the age of was automatically put in that group, to be disposed of. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Well, what they said just for fun, they said we sending them to rest and recreation because they worked so hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">They needed to rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">But what it really meant and we knew that not officially but the rumors were they was being sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And that 1s exactly what happened to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I came back from work one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">My father wasn't there and didn't come back, and I was, where is my father, trying to find out frantically. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Well, he was in a special <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a <span class="DLF">barbed wire enclosure</span> with one <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where they assembled those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">They referred to it as the <span class="BUILDING">dispensary</span> but it wasn't a <span class="BUILDING">dispensary</span> - it was just a gob of people and sent them away in a couple of days or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Well, I saw my father one more time through the barbed wire and it was nothing I could do and nothing he could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And I could only hope for the best, not wanting to be true it is the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> at the other end, but it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And so I know the exact fate of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Uh, he was taken from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blechhammer</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and gassed and disposed of. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And, which also happened to be the fate of my father, of my mother, uh, but in 1942 already. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And uh, so when I was alone, I still had by friend Mike Swab, which was something great to have, to have uh somebody to lean on and he can lean on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And we decided from then more than ever that the first chance we get we're going to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And we worked together, but it was almost impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">The, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> had very high <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">They were made from concrete slabs, and on top of the <span class="DLF">wall</span> of this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was electrically loaded barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">There was no way to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And it was well controlled with <span class="BUILDING">guard towers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And being marched to work everyday, which was several miles, there was no way to escape either. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">There were SS with machine pistols and dogs on each <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">The only <span class="NPIP">place</span> where it would have been possible to escape was at the <span class="DLF">work site</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">If you worked in a separate group like I did, I did sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">But when I worked in a separate group, Mike Swab didn't work in a separate group. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , plan was that if we can escape it should be in a group. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Some of us might be shot in the process of escaping, if it is found out, but some of us might get through. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">So it always better in a group, then split up once you're <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="533">O.K. Uh, we had at that time planned if we get away from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , but then was, once you get, we had blue/white stripped uniforms, and what, what do you do when you escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">You're in the middle of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or some <span class="NPIP">place</span> or <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">My idea was to get to my German friends, this Catholic family by the name of Sonnon (ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muchenglablak</span> (ph), whose parents were friends of my parents, to get to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and then to survive the war in their <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And I am sure they would have done it because they helped my grandparents till they were deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Joasenchat</span> (ph) in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And uh, uh, so Mike Schwab was going to go along with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Either that or we go to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">But he wasn't sure where he would go to in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I was sure where I would go to in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , so we decided it would be <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="541">But then the question was, once you escape, a tattooed number on the arm and uh hair shorn. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">In other words, you looked like a prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And blue/white stripped uniforms that you could throw away if you had other clothes, but you still looked like a prisoner with no hair and looking like a skeleton, you were immediately recognized, so where you going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">So even if you had a chance to escape, and the chances were there frankly, at the place of work, in, in the <span class="BUILDING">synthetic gasoline factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="545">There were many chances. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And some people did escape, but they were all caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And when they were caught, they were brought back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and hung whether they were dead or not dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">They were hung or put on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> for all the prisoners to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Here's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Some of them were shot and the bodies, the mutilated bodies, sometimes were just put in front of the prisoners before uh going to work in the morning so everybody could see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">They were left out all day, all night, you know, so everybody could see what happens to one who escapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And that was standard procedure - to bring them back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and let all the prisoners see what happens to an escapee. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Well, uh, I have one other incident at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blesheimer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Uh, I got hit by machine gun fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">There was when a group was accused of sabotaging the German war effort and some people were, in this, this was a common, not very common, but occassionally some people were accused of not working hard enough, to sabotage the German war effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">In other cases, where three people were hung at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blesheimer</span> ; they were accused of sabotaging the war effort by cutting <span class="DLF">telephone lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">But what they had done, they had done clean-up work where bombs had fallen and some of the prisoners had taken some wire, some electric wire and used them as belts on their pants because we didn't have any belts. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And they were caught and they were accused of having cut the wire and they were hanged publically in front of the group of, the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> being assembled. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">In, in my case, our group was accused of not working too hard and made an example, and, and the SS started firing like a mass execution. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And one of our plans that Mike and I had was also which we had learned from other people, the thing to do to get out of something, if there is not a planned execution where they just make sure everybody is dead, , to drop the moment they start firing, to drop down, and let a body fall over you. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And then be covered up. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And maybe be left for dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And that is exactly what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">But, uh in this particular case, the SS came, apparently they had no intention of maybe having a mass execution but just fire into some prisoners because somebody got angry, or was upset about something, not performing enough work that they, uh whatever the reason was which could be many reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">They just started firing. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">The reason as far as I know was that we didn't perform at work. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And so I was hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Now, my luck was I got out of it and that's another long story and I don't think we have time for that to go into that. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I got out of this alive by getting up later on, going back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and being treated by a prisoner doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Now there was no place that I could go to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I was scrapped (ph) several times, three or four times on my head, and right here, and here, and the hair never grew back and there was a piece of bone missing, but luckily I was, I was a pretty good healer and although I did have puss in it I was healed by this doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And uh with normal thread being used for sewing on buttons uh to fix me up and, and like I said there was no <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> or <span class="BUILDING">dispensary</span> I could go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Well, next day I had to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to rest up or after loss of blood and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Uh, and I was asked since I was bloody and had a bandage around my head, not regular bandage but some old clothing, what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And I said I got hit during the air raid. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And many prisoners were either killed or hurt pretty badly at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blesheimer</span> during the air raids, the bombings of the <span class="BUILDING">synthetic gasoline factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And then prisoners were walked back. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Some days they were lucky - they got some bandage from the local German workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">From the SS we got nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">From the local German workers, which were also hit sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So, and when you walked down in the morning people would say, hey you, you fit to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">You say yes, I'm fit to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I looked very strong even though you had lost some blood you would be really weak, but that was always the thing during the selection process that went through several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">So even if you were, don't come walking up there like you weak, almost falling over, which was the case in most cases and in my case sometimes too but I never let anybody see that I was weak and just looked straight and strong when you went through <span class="DLF">selection line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Well, when I walked out that morning, it wasn't a <span class="DLF">selection line</span> , it was just the guys going out, the guy pointed me out and I said I was hit during the bombardment and he passed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">So that's how I was able to survive that. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Uh, Blesheimer after my father, did exist and I don't have my exact dates. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Till December of 1944 when the Russians advanced. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">At that time, uh the uh order was given to evacuate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="591">We could already hear the sound of war by hearing guns, artillery, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> or whatever, bombings. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And the word we got and we were always a little bit in the dark since officially we got no word at all what was going in the outside world, but occassionally somebody would get a newspaper which was sometimes in some cases punishable by death, depending on how the SS felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">You know, somebody could bring a paper back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or having a radio which I don't know if anyone had, but uh, we were able to find some old newspapers maybe at place of work somebody had thrown away and so we were sort of informed. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">But that was the <span class="REGION">German side</span> that we were reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Uh, in this particular case, I uh, we heard the guns and the rumor came we going to be evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Uh, where to nobody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Away from the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">That wasn't to do us a favor, to get us away from the firing, but because they needed more labor inside <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And they had to get it from somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And I think, I'm not sure, that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was already captured at that time or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I have no knowledge of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">But they were getting close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> too, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I don't think made any death marches. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">People were just left in there or killed or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">But in this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> that we were in, or subcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we were evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">This was the plan I assume, and in an orderly manner we were marched every day, all day and in the night time put in a <span class="DLF">field</span> with lights away from the front towards <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And we finally arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">When somebody couldn't walk because the food, there was almost no food, days, we went for days without food. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Water we got once in a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And I assume, I don't have any specific figure, that we were about four thousand or somewhere close to four thousand prisoners that were marched out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Some people remained behind, and there were other people in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that I read up after the war, that came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="612">They had to put them somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">People who had been marched into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> when we were out already. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">They didn't know what do to with them, the Russians were advancing too fast, and uh, so I don't have any exact figures. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">It was very confusing times but I assume about four thousand prisoners were marched out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blesheimer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Fourteen days later, the death march arrived at the camp of Gross Rosen which was another large, larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And in the group that I was in, we were standing in mud being counted, and I was standing in the front row being able to understand German, being able to understand the SS was reporting to his superior. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">He was delivering 276 prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Now, I can't say to this day if that is what was left of four thousand. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I don't know how many got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I don't know how many were killed every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">But what one of the common things they did was put..... END OF TAPE..... <span class="BUILDING">barnes</span> from farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Whenever they could they usually put maybe about five hundred prisoners to a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">They would lock them up in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">This was for proper control so nobody could run away during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">If they had you out in the open, that meant they have lights on and they couldn't go to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">But if they could lock you up in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , they just have to post two or three guards around and the rest of them could go to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And the prisoners were locked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Uh, so I don't know how many people were executed in <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> because there were a lot of executions going on and everyday, every morning before mein dof (ph) they said who cannot march any more, and people would say I can, I can, but they were just dragging themselves on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">They would shoot them by the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="631">They would just pile them up and fire into the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">The regular mass executions. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">They make sure nobody is left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">They even went so far to make it easy, I don't know what they tried to do, they picked cemeteries to execute people, next to cemeteries. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Maybe they thought they ought to get buried in a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">I don't know why but it is very odd. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">But in two cases, I've seen people be executed near <span class="BUILDING">cemeteries</span> , next to <span class="BUILDING">cemeteries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Uh, so from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gross Rosen</span> , the 276 prisoners plus other prisoners that were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gross Rosen</span> , were transported in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="639">This was a few days later. </span><span class="sentence" id="640"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> was of course well inside <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , was on the <span class="REGION">western front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Here we're coming from the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> to the <span class="REGION">western front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And we arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , we didn't arrive, we arrived near the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> , which is rather large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , on the <span class="DLF">track</span> leading through the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> to the other side of, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And uh we were very unfortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> must have been spotted by <span class="DLF">air</span> , by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> , and I don't know whether they were British or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American airplanes</span> , uh, but the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was stationary at that time, the engine was stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">But it was just outside the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> before getting to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , and when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was bombed, our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was hit and split open. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Some people were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">But neither Michael or I were hit at all, probably covered by others, and we got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and this was near some <span class="BUILDING">German homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Now, we knew we were hungry, we were starved because we hadn't gotten any food from the time we left Gross Rosen in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Uh, we went into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , it was the nearest <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">It was near the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> and went in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and helped ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">The inhabitants of this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> were sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , because the bombing was still going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And the clear wasn't given. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">The moment the all clear was given we had our parkas full of food and we had eaten quite a bit while we were stuffing ourselves, or loading up with food. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And many prisoners did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Those that were caught were shot by the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">We didn't get caught because that was uh, taboo, of course, going into <span class="BUILDING">German homes</span> and grabbing food. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">But again there was no way to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">At that time it would have been very easy to escape during the bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Where to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Hair shorn off, number on the arm, and blue/white stripped uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">No <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And it was So easy to escape at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Well, I don't know how many survived the, uh, this bombing but the rest of us finally arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , we thought this was going to be the end now. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">They're not going to take us anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Apparently they didn't know which way to go, from the east to the west, from the west to the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">The Americans were coming the other way, so, and there were selection processes at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And I didn't mention the selection processes before, but I went through several selection processes. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Some of them were more formal than others, and others were just when you went to work guys were picked out and you stayed behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">You were not strong enough anymore or you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">But this was a regular selection process, where to we didn't know at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Uh, and again, Mike and I went to the right <span class="NPIP">side</span> , looking strong and fit, and even asked the questions, are you strong and do you speak German? </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Now, O.K. So we had no idea where we were being shipped off to, but we were given shots at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I am coming back to that in a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">What worried me long after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Uh, there was apparently typhus, and we had heard of sterilization. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">In many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> there they had experimented with sterilization and in some cases people were sterilized just for the sake of sterilization and in other <span class="NPIP">placces</span> it was just for experimentation. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And I had thought that at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> before going to the next camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leigenstein-Zwieberge</span> (ph), that I had maybe been sterilized. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I didn't know what sterilization involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">It's not just giving somebody a shot, but for a long, for about a year after the war, I never wanted to face the question but I thought maybe I had been sterilized. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">But it turned out that I never was sterilized because we have six children, so I was safe on that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">But for a long time it was on my mind, and the only thing that I could find out that we were given shots against typhus and some other things, which was prevalent at the time and they wanted healthy workers, healthy as they could possibly be, at least not have a disease that kills everyone in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="686">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> then we uh, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> we were transported to the camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leigenstein- Zwieberge</span> (ph) which was a subcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And it was hidden in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Harz Mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="688">But we didn't know at the time that 1t was a secret project of the SS where they were building <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Harz Mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Their was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> (ph) which 1s a more famous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> on the other end of the <span class="DLF">Harz Mountains</span> and we were at the lower end of the <span class="DLF">Harz Mountains</span> , building <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> to construct the V-2, the flying bomb or like we have seen in the <span class="BUILDING">Smithsonian Museum</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Uh, the V-2 was the secret weapon of Hitler, and the only way they could produce any was underground because of the bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">So they had picked the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Harz Mountains</span> to construct a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> underneath. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Now at the end where we were, there was no <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="693">The <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was operating up north, but we were constructing the second project, and the job consisted of being marched from work everyday from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was also about four thousand people, and which was a very mixed camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">The Jews were a minority in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">The camp was practically led by communist prisoners, German communists, who had been there, the first ones 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Another group, there was a replenishment group and they were pretty well organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">But the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was a terrible <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> was a temporary camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had existed, by the time I got there, only about four months or five months, so it was a brand new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> so it was only going to be there for the purpose of constructing these <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Uh, the march to the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> was very tedious every day, and almost no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And again the replenishment method was five hundred people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Uh, each time five hundred people were dead, five hundred people, and they were thrown in <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">There was no burning of bodies and I worked on one of the <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> , I was detailed to that for a short while and fortunately only doing one thing, digging the <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And today there are out of seven thousand prisoners who were totally there, for the normal amount of prisoners was four thousand, but there were three additional thousand that came to replenish. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">So then all of them in <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="705">There is a <span class="DLF">site</span> - I never went back there although I have a standing invitation from the East German government to come back and be their guest - that they know of me as the only survivor who lives in the <span class="REGION">western world</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And uh so the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> is still in existence, a national monument, and young soldiers, East German, are being sworn in at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="707">But it 1s one of the worst <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">So the <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> are there. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">They have a very nice <span class="DLF">site</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="710">They send me pictures every year, and the story exists although I do believe that uh, uh, that maybe the story is not complete. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">It 1s probably worse than if you actually read this. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">It is not the same thing if somebody tells you about it is my opinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">You cannot picture this. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">You cannot picture going hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Sometimes I think if you tell someone what hungry is like. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lichtenstein</span> , the work was the killing method of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">By that I mean working in <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> without the proper protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">You had to dig, get the rocks out, haul them on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span> out or carry them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And then the blasting. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">They never had the prisoners far enough away that somebody wouldn't get killed by the dynamite blasting and then they would carry the rocks off. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">So the German guards, the SS guards always stood far enough away so they wouldn't get hit, but they didn't let the prisoners get out far enough to be safe from the blasting, so many people were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And those people had to be carried back at night and put into the <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="723">You know, thrown in. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And I also must mention one horrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">At the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leichenstein</span> , they buried many people who were alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">People who were too weak, who couldn't get off their knees anymore, to get up, to stand up to go to work, and they were put in a pile with the dead people and buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">At one time somebody refused to bury after they were all thrown 1n, a few live people were still moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">He had recognized somebody that he knew and refused to throw earth on him and the man was shot at the <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="729">That happened to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leichenstein</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And uh, there are many stories, too many of them to tell because it was by far the worst <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that I existed in, and was the least known <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> because it was a secret project. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Now, when I mentioned it contained a secret project, this I also read up after the war although there was something known about it, something special about this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="732">It was like a lot of rumors were circulating all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">It was a common rumor which turned out to be true after I read up on it that the order from the SS was that in case of, there wouldn't be no evacuation of the camp in case the Americans come. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">All prisoners have to be killed, no survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Because it was considered a secret project which they were building a special <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Now, uh, while we were working in the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> , there were German engineers in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I was able to get to one and ask him what he would do with his torn clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Every once in a while he would take something off that was torn or bring it back and even some of them would give it to the prisoners because we were always cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">First of all, it was freezing in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Uh, I'm talking about the beginning of 1945, the mid-winter, when we started there. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And I asked this German engineer if he has any old clothing he could bring in that we could wear under our prisoner blue/white stripped uniform and he said yes he would. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And I said I have a friend too, and I said he would bring in some warm clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">So he was one of the good guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And we were able to pick up this clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">He left it ina certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we picked it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And the main reason for this clothing was not to be warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">That too, but the main reason was to be able to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">We figured this is one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we will never get out of if the war lasts any longer and we had no idea in January or February how long the war was going to last. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And we say if we did well so far, we are not going to do well here because no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And there was killing by working people to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">That was all, and beating to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">QUESTION:  I just want to ask you......
ANSWER:  Yes, this was one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> where Mike was working in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but at night time we were together in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Uh, the specific story that I can tell, there are really too many, but is how we were put in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , just lined up like sardines. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">There was not enough <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep, for everybody to stretch out. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">There were no double <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="756">It was just the plain <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> I was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">But apparently the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was created for a lot less people and then there are four thousand people and maybe the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was created for a thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">I would say so. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">But then the people just stretch out on all these <span class="INT_SPACE">barrack floors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And uh, at night time when people would come back from work in the dark, there would be no light on. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">People would fight and actually strangle each other, become like animals, just to get a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And we were attacked many times, but Mike and I, we always stood together and we defended ourselves, just for having a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">People were just like animals and there were people who went to the pile up place where there were bodies and thought they could cut out a piece of meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And they were caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And some would be severely punished for doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">These peoples were considered inhuman, but they were crazed from hunger, some of these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And particularly when somebody was left in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> of a couple of days, too weak to go to work, and it would be the end after a few days anyway and people would die. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And like I said, they grabbed some of these people and buried them alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">They didn't even pile them up anymore <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , just took them directly to the <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And each <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leigenberg-Zwieberge</span> (ph) has five hundred people and I believe there were six of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Uh, now, the story in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , this is one of my most vivid memories of all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , is that overhead, these were just one floor <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and we sleep on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">There were rafters overhead holding the <span class="DLF">roof</span> together, and every morning as we got up there would be people hanging. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Every morning, in every <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Because people knew they were not going to survive and any day, and might as well die now instead of living a few more days, a few more weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Well, lucky for Mike and me, we didn't feel that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">We figure it's got to be the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">We're going to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">We have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And, uh, maybe they're going to evacuate us you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">We also hear that the Allies are coming closer, but we were just .. And we teamed with four other guys at that time who also had the same ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">They were all about our age and they were all making it sort of, like we did, being able to stand up on their own two legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And we said, we shall escape together. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And they also had gotten civilian clothes like we did from some other <span class="NPIP">place</span> they were working, they were wearing underneath their blue/white stripped uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And, uh, so we said, well we'll try and escape and then we go in different directions, maybe two one way, two another way, maybe one SS guard is firing, maybe he'll hit some of us, maybe he won't hit anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">But some of us will get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">But we always noticed that if one person would escape they would always hit him, by submachine gun fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Automatic fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">So we had that in mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">We always stuck together. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">And said if it comes to an evacuation we won't be on a death march like the one from the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> that we will never survive, because we know what happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And we should escape then from the march because that would be towards the end anyway from . </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Uh, coming back to the people that were hanging themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">It was our job every morning before going <span class="NPIP">outside</span> for report period, people would be counted - how many are still alive, how many are still there - that we had to take those bodies down from the <span class="DLF">rafters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And pile them outside the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and then another group would come and pick them up and take them to the <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Uh, my, if I, for years, and I still do occasionally, there wasn't a night, and I, like I mentioned, I have a large family so my family gets my mind off these things and I have a very normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">I have had after the war, or soon after I get married it was more normal than ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Uh, for years, when I had dreams it was about escaping, escaping. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Because it was always on our minds, escaping. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">Whenever I had a dream, even today when I am sometimes, probably tonight I'll have one, I will dream about escaping. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">It was a standard thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And that is what kept me alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">That's what kept Michael Schwab (ph) alive, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And, but the other dream that is more frequent than any dream about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , is about the people hanging themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">There is nothing more vivid in my mind than seeing those people taking their own lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">It was bad enough, somebody else taking your life, or mass execution, but people just giving up, just plain giving up. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And I have had occasions, and I don't do this anymore since I know what my problem is, that I watered the <span class="DLF">lawn</span> one day at my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and my pants were very wet, and I hung up the pants in the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , and the pants were just hanging there, and I got up during the night and that's nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">When I have a bad dream, and I walked into where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> is and I saw these pants hanging and immediately I thought somebody was hanging there. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And, uh, like suicides are, is one of the worst memories I have, because so many people committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Not just by rafters. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">We had people, and my thoughts have been divided on that - whether it was a courageous act or a coward's act, I'm not judging people when they commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">I would never do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Uh, I would feel, I get through things. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And uh, although, given thought, yes, I must admit I've given it thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I think everyone who has been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> has given thought to suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">But uh, I have seen a man commit suicide why I thought it was a courageous act. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">When he stood in front, when we were repairing a <span class="DLF">railway</span> , and the <span class="DLF">second line</span> (ph) a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">speed train</span> came by and he just went in front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and he stood there facing it and he got run over by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="819">It killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And I, you know, there were many other ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">We tried to prevent suicides, but that is a Shameful thing in my opinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">On my own part, the only thing I would help somebody that wants to die, let them die if they want to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">That's an old man that I saw had cut his wrists, and I shouted because there was blood spurting from his wrists, and we made a tourniquet, bandaged him up and he was taken back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and he was beated up savagely and he was killed that night for trying to deprive the German state of labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And that was the sentence on this guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">You couldn't even commit suicide - that was against the law to commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And that man would have been much better off dying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> where I found him, at work. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And uh, so, from then on my idea was about suicide, if somebody wants to do it, let them do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Now, if it would have been somebody close to me 1t would have been a different story. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">Like if my friend Mike Schwab would have done it, I would have tried to talk him out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">But I knew that he, that just a momentary thing, it is not something he believes in. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I think a lot of people think about it for a long time before they do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Or they do it on short notice. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">They say all of a sudden, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">Well, uh, these are some of the incidents, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lagenstein</span> was probably the worst <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the worst memories I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">Everything goes into the background when I think about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Langenstein</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And uh, we were also the first time, I didn't mention this, this was also common practice, when you did something you weren't supposed to be doing, or they just wanted to get to you somehow, you got beatings. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Officially, not just being hit, but being laid over what they called the bok (ph), which is like a special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> for beatings, and they would lash you. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Mike and I both got caught one time, hiding, trying to get out of some work, and we got special beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">But we were strong and we were able to survive it, although Mike got the worst of it and on your bare rear and I got hit, by other prisoners - they had to do this, the SS didn't do this, just counted and stood by - but my guard left for a while because he wanted to get some cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And so the prisoner didn't beat me as hard as he should have, and he told me to shout real loud, to scream. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And I did, so I didn't get a very hard beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">It was fifty lashes and my friend Mike got fifty full, and his posterior was bleeding and pussy for a long, long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">There was nothing to treat him with. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">So this was common <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="845">Not only at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Langenstein</span> but in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lagenstein</span> was the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">So I am coming to the next and the last story I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">My escape.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="868">QUESTION:  I just want to come back to the story of your escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="869">ANSWER:  O.K. We knew the Allies were approaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And in this case the American Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">That was more or less known. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">Uh, some people overheard the SS - they were talking the Americans are coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">O.K. What's the next thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">The order was to evacuate the prisoners, but noboby knew where. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">So Mike and I made up our mind, the other four guys, we're going to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">The first march that we make, the first night or the second or third or whenever we can, we're not going to last for fourteen days. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">But, as they transported us, we went out in groups of five hundred people, and the SS did that for a purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">I didn't know that at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">We thought it was for better control. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Instead of having a large group of four thousand prisoners, or three thousand five hundred together in one group, if there is a mass escape, they cannot kill everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">So they took groups of five hundred people each. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">And we thought that was for better control. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">Have the guards around, and some of them with dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">I think each group had about one or two police dogs, German Shepherds, and they were pretty vicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">And I didn't even tell any story about the dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Cough. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Uh, when we were marched out in groups of five hundred, we thought it was for control purpose and the order was to march prisoners at night so the population wouldn't see us, and to sleep them and rest during the day, because the SS had to rest to. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">But we walked out and we were walking towards the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> , and then we were redirected. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">Now this I found later. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">I didn't know all this at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">Because from the publication that the East Germans sent me, what actually happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">The order, and this I found out after the war, I didn't know this at the time, the order was to take the groups of prisoners, in group of five hundred, in different <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> and dynamite the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> and bury the prisoners alive in there, so there would be no survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">Because the order was no survivors from that particular secret project. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">If they shoot them, yes, they could have done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">But easier to drive them to the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> , which was just a few miles away, and dynamite the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">But as it turned out, they were in radio contact with their former observers, or troops, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Uh, there was American tank column cited coming around the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And they were looking for the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="899">They knew there was something secret going on because they are trying to find the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> by <span class="DLF">air</span> one time because we were there and there was air alarm, and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">torpedo plane</span> and tried to put a torpedo into the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="900">It was not successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">It was all camouflaged. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">Uh, they redirected us because they thought the American tank column was going to cut us off before they get to the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="903">So we marched back. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">We marched to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and then we marched, to make a long story short, we marched three nights till we actually escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And what happened, every night, they parked us, let us rest in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , just like in the first march. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">During the day, they took, they requisitioned a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> from a farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Since we were only five hundred people and they could put five hundred people in almost any <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> , squeeze them in 1f it's a small <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , and then, bring us out at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">Now, if the farmer was a decent guy, he had some potatoes and food for the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">Even for five hundred because he's feeding cows and other animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">So in the first and second night we got some food from the farmer, it was the only thing, and water. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">In the night time, they put the prisoners, of course, into these <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> and they posted guards <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="912">The next morning, march again. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">Whoever couldn't march was shot by the SS - the same system like the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">So, again, we were prepared at that time - we were wearing our civilian clothes underneath and we said we've got to go the first chance we get. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">So on the third night, we had just, we had decided if we had crossed several small <span class="DLF">bridges</span> or small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">streams</span> or <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> , we have to get across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> because, we could all swim, we knew that. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And we had decided after crossing a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> would be the most opportune moment to escape and then go towards, or swim across because a dog would pursue you on <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="917">But a dog would not swim across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> unless he 1s trained to do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">But the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> ' dogs I don't think were trained to go into <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="919">They were trained to pursue prisoners on <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="920">So we decided that ours, and then he would not, he could not smell, dogs cannot smell across <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> but they can smell across <span class="REGION">land</span> , so they can follow you. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">If they turn the dog loose. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Well what happened then, on the third night we had just come across a small <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="923">We didn't know where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">We were getting away from the <span class="REGION">American front</span> , that's all we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Where to nobody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And I don't think, the SS were just trying to get us away because they didn't know what to do, and I think there must have been a dissention among them whether to kill or not to kill the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And I think one case I heard that a SS tried to make contact with the prisoners, that he was a good guy, that they should say so in case the Americans come. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">So maybe some of them were O.K. and some of them were not, and some were just scared and maybe the troop transports on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and they were particularly following <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And that's where all the transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">As we came across a small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> there was an air alert, and it was normal procedure, as we were walking in ranks of four, with the SS on the side on a small <span class="DLF">country road</span> , a body seen from the <span class="DLF">air</span> , and by that I mean at night time, signled <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> who would be the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">observation plane</span> ... TAPE ENDS... and prisoners escaped and this happened and they got shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">When <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> were not around, they put the searchlights on and sent the dog after them, or they would shoot the prisoner and they couldn't run so fast, you know, and __. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">So there were several, there were, a matter of fact, quite a few escapes but everyone of them would get caught, so we thought that the time to escape was near a small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> if we were lucky amd we had lucky a plan overhead, just above where we were going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">So we were lying down and we knew that were going to be no searchlight on and we took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">All six of us said go, and we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And we must have been just a couple of hundred yards away from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and one dog that decided the last moment's enough for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">I got bitten by the dog in my leg, and I didn't even feel it. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">I didn't even know I was bitten. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">I thought, I fell a couple of times, but the dog, you cannot see as well, but the dog went after the other prisoners, and I don't know to this date - I never found out the story - but only Mike and I made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">The others went in different directions, like I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">That was our plan, to go in different directions and some of us get through. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">Either some of these people are killed by the dog, but we didn't see anybody and we inquired a little bit about it later on after our liberation, but they didn't know of any other prisoners that escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">They knew, because we were reported by the SS to the local police, there are two escaped prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">So I assume that the other four were killed and they found them. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">But Mike and I got to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and we swam across, and then we were safe from the SS, from the dog, and the first thing we did, we figure if we stay out in the open, we're sunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">They maybe come with a local police dog and sniff us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And we didn't smell so good and uh, we were full of lice and I mean, even with our civilian clothes on, I had a black jacket on, the white lice were just running around on the suit. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">And anybody would have recognized somebody coming from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="948">But anyway, the first thing we did we went to some, there were some <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> nearby, and like I said it was at night and I don't remember what time it was but it must have been past midnight, maybe two or three in the morning and people would be asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">So we decided we have to get off the <span class="DLF">roads</span> , off the <span class="REGION">land</span> where somebody could find us the next morning and hid someplace where it is safe, but not out in the open. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">So we got to a <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> and we found a <span class="DLF">window</span> next to the, where the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> is. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">Underneath the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> there is, this was a solid build, <span class="BUILDING">brick stable</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="952">And underneath the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> they had a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , and this was a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> for the foods for the animals, and also the <span class="INT_SPACE">potatoe cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="953">They store hugh amount of potatoes in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and we decided to get in through the <span class="DLF">cellar hole</span> which was from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , not going through the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">When we lifted it up, I let myself down. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">We didn't know what we would hit in the dark, whether it would be some water or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">We were scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And Michael was holding on to my arms, and I said there must be something below me. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">It smells like maybe potatoes, I wasn't sure you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And I guess right, I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">I figured it was potatoes, and then he let me go, and maybe about a couple inches below my feet I hit potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">But I was afraid that I wouldn't get out anymore if I let myself drop or whatever in the dark, and you don't know what is going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">So anyway, Michael came in and then we dug a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the potatoes so we figured in the morning somebody might open up the <span class="DLF">door</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">potatoe cellar</span> , we'd be sitting right on top of the potatoes sleeping or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">So we dug a <span class="DLF">hole</span> into the potatoes, covered us up with potatoes, and there was enough <span class="DLF">air</span> to get in of course, that was no problem, until we knew the next day where we were and what we could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">So we got out the next day when everything was quiet, the next evening when it started getting dark, and we stayed there a full day, and of course were not found. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">And then we went into, we got some milk to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">We went into the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="967">We found some milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">I think it was put there for the cats. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">They had a lot of cats. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">We drank the milk from the cats and we got food that was for the cows, and we took and filled out pocket up with potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">We ate raw potatoes, that didn't, but we were worried about diarrhea, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">Anything raw. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">But we got our first real food, and then we went our way. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Uh, we decided that to use the same routine, to sleep during the day, in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> , but get away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> now, and uh, to go towards the sound of the artillery fire that was coming closer and closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">We didn't know which direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">We didn't know which uh way should we get away. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">Where we would go? </span><span class="sentence" id="978">Would be another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in front of us or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">But we wanted to get away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , uh, because that's where most people were and we would be recognized possibly. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">Uh, what we did then is sleep in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> during the day near some <span class="DLF">field</span> or someplace and then march at night toward the sound of fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">And that took us seven days. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">And there 1s another little story but I think it is so long, un incidents along the way, but anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">We came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="984">QUESTION:  We have plenty of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="985">ANSWER:  We have plenty of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">O.K. We had the most fantastic thing happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">I think you have to have, you have to be lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">I keep stressing that, not just do some thinking, but also be lucky and healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">On the sixth day or so, it was just a day or two before our actual liberation, we were sleeping in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="990">Actually one was supposed to be watching, one was supposed to be sleeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">I was supposed to be sleeping, Mike was supposed to be watching. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And, but watching would not have helped very much except somebody's coming and they couldn't run away and then somebody would know. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">But we could kill one person. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">We decided if somebody is getting dangerous and tells us to come along with them or something that we would strangle the person. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">We knew we could do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">We had absolutely made up our mind that's what we would do. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">But we were both asleep and being awakened by jack boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">Now jack boots was what the SS wore, but he was the local policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">There must have been only one policeman in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">And uh, he said, identification, he said in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">And we said, well we are foreign workers, we are from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> we said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">And Michael started talking Dutch a little bit and I spoke Dutch of course too, and we started mixing our German with a little Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">And he said I want to see papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">We don't have any papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">He said where are your papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">I said we've been bombed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">When we came back from the <span class="DLF">fields</span> from work, we were foreign workers here, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> wasn't there anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">Everything just what we're wearing to work - that's what we have, no more papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">And he started looking at us and he started going like this, He saw the lice crawling around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">You know, stay away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">Then he said, mitcom, come with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">I said oh my God, the SS, where to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">Well he said, and he seemed to be inebriated a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">He had just had a couple of drinks, beers probably, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">And the war was coming to an end, and things were pretty confusing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And we could smell the alcohol on him, and figured well, this man is maybe not dangerous but we don't want to anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">What are we doing to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">He had a pistol in his holster, and I said we can grab it and kill him but then somebody is really going to come looking for us, and maybe we can't get that far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">Everybody be alerted or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">So we figure, we noticed that the man was not decent, but he was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And he said at the end, he made a comment to it, well he said I have to take you because there are some escaped prisoners in this are
ANSWER:  And we figured I said are we going to get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">Well, he said if you, if we can identify you, he said you can get some temporary papers because a lot of people have lost their papers because of bombings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">They came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> - no more <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">But I cannot let you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">So I said to Michael, I looked at him and I said, what do we do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">I said, kill him? </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">You know, we had a little sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">But we couldn't say anything, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">We could just look at each other and try to understand each other through eye movements, and we could see this guy wasn't really all there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">He was, as a matter of fact, he was about, I was going to say an old man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">He was my age or older. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">And, uh, so I said well, let's try it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">Maybe we're lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">And, we can't, maybe we're, somebody's going to find out about us here in the open anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">If he lets us go now maybe then send a search house party for us or let's go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">So he took us to <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">The <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> was just a part-time job for - it was a full time job for the policeman - part-time job for the mayor who was a farmer, and he was burning papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">We came in there and he had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> burning papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">And he said in German, or course, we couldn't understand everything, he said I pick up some Dutch workers here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">When he said that I felt pretty secure you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">And he said they lost there papers in a bombing raid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">Uh, can we give them some papers? </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">Ah, he said, ; what's the use, the war is finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">He said who cares about papers the mayor said you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">And he didn't want to have anything to do with anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">And he looked at us and he said to us, and the guy, the policeman went in the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to make a phone call or to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">I didn't know what he was doing, but he left for a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">He said to us, the mayor, we have some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> escapees in here, so we are being careful you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">He looked at us like he knew we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">And we figured he's not going to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">So we said, well, the policeman came back in, and he said, get rid of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">I don't want to have anything to do with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">And he said, well, I said, we have to get some, and then we started getting frantic (ph), and said give us some paper please. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">I said that you know we lost our papers in a bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">Well I said, I can't give you any paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">There is nothing you can prove, nothing I can prove. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">So anyway, there was a big discussion and finally said, well, we're not going to insist because this guy might change his mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">And so he, the mayor said to the policeman, why don't you take them and get them out of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">Well, he got us out of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">By the time we got to the next <span class="BUILDING">guest house</span> , <span class="BUILDING">beer house</span> , he smelled beer again, and he said well, you go this way and then you go to next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">Maybe they will give you some paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">And he went into the <span class="BUILDING">beer hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">And we were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">I said, Michael, I said, we got out of something that could have turned out bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">The only thing it would have made us is killers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">We trying to save our lives and it would have gone wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">So we were lucky again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And somehow it was always a sense that we're going to make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">I mean the sense never left us, Michael and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">And then, somehow, through luck or through our own thinking, or, or doing things the right way and uh, mostly luck, that we're going to make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">The one thing that never left me is the sense that if anybody's going to make it, I'm going to make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">And never give up hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">And Michael was the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">And O.K. Now our actual liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">So we went to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">And we noticed that this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> when we got <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , on the outskirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , there were <span class="DLF">fields</span> that some people had next to their <span class="DLF">farms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">We said we cannot be out in the open <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">There wasn't that much other vegetation there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">Let's get close to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where there are some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> or something and sit down or lay down and go to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">The Americans got to be here anytime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">So, we laid out there, and in the night we heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> rolling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">And then we heard German voices, and we didn't know this, when we got there, they had placed that same evening what they called faukstorma (ph), which is the German national guard if you call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">They are old guys and young fellows. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">Last minute they put them into uniform and make soldiers out of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">And they had placed these guys with ponce so founst (ph) in little <span class="DLF">holes</span> in the ground to be a defense against <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">And ponce so foust (ph) is a, I'm not sure what, we call it a anti-tank weapon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">It's a shoulder held weapon that one man can fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">It's not a gun and they can sit in a <span class="DLF">hole</span> and usually one loads the gun and one fires the gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">And there was one very close to us, and we wanted to, the first thing we wanted to do was when we would hear <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> coming across the <span class="DLF">field</span> , go towards the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , put our arms up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">But we figure if we do this we may get shot from behind or something for deserters in the dark or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">And we didn't want to get shot by the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> either you know, by the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">So as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> were coming across in the morning, it must have been about five o'clock in the morning, as it started getting a little light - no it wasn't getting light that time - but they started coming about five o'clock I think - I didn't have a watch - we decided we're going to move on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> towards them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">Well, somebody noticed something moving in that one <span class="DLF">hole</span> , and they had in the meantime had <span class="DLF">holes</span> on the right, probably on both sides of where we were __. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">But we were far enough away not to be seen, maybe uh, hundred and fifty yards from each <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">I don't know, but we must have been right in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">And uh, one guy called over in German, what 1s that patrol (ph) 1s this a patrol, because they didn't know from their own people that - they just thought it was a German army patrol. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And I said to the guy, hel mut (ph), keep your mouth shut, shut up I said, and the guy was quiet you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">And he probably was believing that we were German patrols since he could only see us crawling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">And then it takes the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> , one company of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> for seventeen <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , all of a sudden came across the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">And as soon as we saw the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> coming we put up our hands and we were just hoping that they wouldn't start firing, because prisoners get shot sometimes too, even if you give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">Well, the lead <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> , the guy jumped down, and he spoke German, he was a German-American that they used as an interpreter, and he made all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> stop and he brought the officers up, the commanding officer, and they radioed back to the battalion that they had some guys who were escaped prisoners, and to make a long story short, they used us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">In other words, we knew what was in front of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">Which was the right thing to do and we were glad to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">And they said you're prisoners, you look like prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">can you prove it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">We showed the number on the arm and apparently some of them knew already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">They had crossed a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , another one someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">This was the Third Armored Division, D Company of the 32nd Armored Regiment of the Third Armored Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">One of Patton's divisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">And uh, so we had a small conference there, and they if we say any German army units, or they were particularly interested German 88 anti-tank guns, and I said all we know the German ponce de foust (ph), the anti-tank weapon, and they are all old or young guys as far as we can determine from their voices but we don't know for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">We just crawled through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">So they got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> with the P.
ANSWER:  system and the guy in this German said there are no German army troops around, there are only the army helpers, the national guard or the uh, German folkstrom (ph), young guys and old people - that 1t would be silly to fire one shot because the moment the first shot is fired, they are going to destroy the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">And they hoisted white flags and they gave up and there was not one shot fired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">And uh, so, then, it came to us, and we were taken back to <span class="BUILDING">battalion headquarters</span> where the battalion surgeon examined us right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">We were then put on scales and uh, it was a small, like a small, not <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , a batallion aid station. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">And they had all the medical equipment to take care of, and that was basically our liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">And then the regimental commander came looking at us, congratulating us and then the company commander said if they want to stay with us, the boys they can stay with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">Then when they went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , they requisitioned a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for the two of us, and told the women to make a hot bath for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">That we were going to be bathed by medics, and cleaned up completely, because they have to go on, and we can't go with lice with them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">That we have to be , and they came with Lysol and whatever you have as a disinfectant, and we were completely taken care of medically. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">And examined by a medical doctor or military doctor and found to be healthy, not have any communicable diseases. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">But it actually wasn't exact the first day, we went through a couple of days of check-ups. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">But in the meantime, we were then, the first thing to do was get rid of the lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">And that we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">And our hair shorn off again for last time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And uh, then, we stayed, to make a long story short, we stayed with D Company of this tank battalion for six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">The war was over in another few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">And they were taken out of combat immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">After that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , that was their last combat session. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">And we stayed with them, and with an O.K. by the higher ups, that we can stay as long as we want to until we find our families, â€˜til we are certain we are finding anybody family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">In the meantime, we are changed from these old prisoner garments to GI uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">We were just like soldiers without rank of course and we were treated in the <span class="BUILDING">mess hall</span> like kings, and we had access to the <span class="BUILDING">mess hall</span> , not during dinner hours but anytime we wanted to walk in eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">We picked up 50 pounds in three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">Which was really a dangerous thing to do because I heard a lot of prisoners overate, and we did too, and killed themselves overeating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">And that basically is the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And uh, so, then to finish up, after our escape, my first thought was to find the family, but I didn't know where to start. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">And first we had to get back on track, get normal again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">So Michael and I stayed and like I said for six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">And then we were taken back, they were moved back to the <span class="REGION">area</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schofenborg</span> (ph) which is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , into their regular <span class="REGION">area</span> where they were going to settle down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">This little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Viny Koomstad</span> (ph) near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">And this company was then settled down and we settled down with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">We given a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , a <span class="NPIP">place</span> they requisitioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">So the first thing, we still didn't have any papers, the question of papers, what to do about papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">So they inquired with the police and say, they have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">When we heard <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , just the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">name camps</span> , no way we're going to any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">We didn't know at the time about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">To us <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> was another, a better <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">You know, another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">But it wasn't true of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">But we just heard the name camp and we said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">And uh, the batallion commander said the boys don't have to go to any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> if they don't want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">They just go to get papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">So they commander officer sent an officer with us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt DP camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">This was right in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> where there was a compound where all the Jewish refugees moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">Ah, not just Jewish refugees, there were other refugees, but they were mostly Jews that had been liberated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or were picked up in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , forced laborers from other <span class="REGION">foreign countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">They were in an <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> and there was a guard at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> but you could walk in and out once you had your papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">But people were taken care of medically and furnished papers after they were identified. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">So he took us 1n there and the uh, official said they have to stay here, they can't go back with you because they don't have any papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">It will take maybe, take weeks before we get any confirmation on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">And we have such a overload here anyway, and the lieutenant looked at us, and he said, well, what you decide boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">And the thing was up to us, not to this guy, official there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">And I said we're not staying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">Papers or no papers, we're not going to stay in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">And we stay with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">So he took us back and then there was an agreement reached that we can stay until we get papers, until we also, even after we get papers, we can stay with them while we decide where our families are, go back to, Michael to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and my case go both to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muchenglablak</span> (ph), <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">Because either <span class="NPIP">place</span> our family could have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">But we had decided in the case of my immediate family was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">My parents that we would meet in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">Or meet 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muchenglablak</span> (ph) with a Catholic family that we know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">So I went to both <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">Didn't find of course anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">And I did find some distant cousins and I did make some contact with the Joint Distribution Committee, which was of course a Jewish organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And although I didn't find anybody, I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , and uh, was taken care of by the Jewish organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , and then the thing I have to get some education and so on, and then I, by that time I was alsmost 19. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">No, by the time I came back I was 19 already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">Uh, they said that I am too old for an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , too lot Jewish orphans or kids that were picked up after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">But the man that ran the Joint Distribution Organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> was Mr. Munsba (ph) who had been one of my father's friends in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French camps</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Cyprien</span> , and he said, well, 18 is the limit for <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> , but you're past limit, but we'll let you have a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in here, and you find a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">We'll put you through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">We'll do something for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">So I got a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> there and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and tried to learn a trade at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">And Michael went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">He wasn't as lucky as I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">He didn't find, well I didn't find anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">He didn't find anyone from his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">Everybody was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">And uh, he didn't have the offer to go into an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> or anything up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">So he went back to the Third Armored Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">They had given him papers, they had given me papers too, to use official transportation and just like military, like an American military guy, to get back to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">We were fully covered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">So Michael took advantage of that and uh, make his long story afterward short, he was adopted by an American soldier, non-Jewish soldier, to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">And he stayed with him until he actually left for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">I remained in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , and I also came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but I came in a different way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">I came by asking for visa to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and I had to wait until December '47 to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">I did get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">And the draft was still going on here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">I was going to be drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">In Europe, if you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> of course, but <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> didn't have an army, but other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , like <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , or <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , they were still drafting too after the war for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">I would have been subject to the draft. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">Well, 1t would have been a bad thing after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">You know, you want to lead a regular life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">But here the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> had nothing to do with me, that my past was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">I would have been subject to the draft. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">So what I did instead, I volunteered for military service with the agreement they had at this time to get the GI Bill, or to remain and make the military a career. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">What I was after getting an education from the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">I did exactly that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">I came in as an enlisted man, I became a sergeant, then became a citizen and when I got my citizenship was able to go to Officer's Candidate School and became an officer and make the Army a career for twenty years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">And uh, I had by initial boots anyway with the army after my liberation and I was very successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">And then I joined the civil service after my military career. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">And I was another twenty years in the civil service. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">But I probably missed the story that is very close to my heart that I wanted to mention about my children, about my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">And I married a German woman who's not Jewish, and my children grew up Jewish in remembrance of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">And nothing else, if I don't feel that strong about religion, I wanted them to have something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">Everybody should grow up with a religion, and have a belief, believe in something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">And the closest thing to me was being Jewish, and closer than that, that my parents had to die because they were Jews, the sole reason, because they were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">And uh, I'm going to bring up one more thing here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">Uh, about two months ago, I made a trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">And I visited my, the old folks are not alive anymore, the Christian people that helped my family, that helped my grandparents who by the way were deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lasenstadt</span> (ph), the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and also perished, including an 80 year old grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">My father, before he died, sat down with me in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> at night, and tried to recall everybody that was left from the Willner family in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">And that possibly also had the same fate that we had went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">Uh, he had a very good memory, and he counted out all the people, naming names, and I must have known personally maybe two-thirds of the people that he mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">The others were not known to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">But they were all the Willner family - it was a close, closely-knit family who all lived in the Rhineland of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne-Dusseldorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">So the distances weren't very great, they even weren't spread out over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">I think one lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , but the rest of them lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhineland</span> and had been living there for the past four hundred years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">I even have some documentation that I got in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , with the Hebrew name of one of my ancestors who first had the name of Willner and he had a Hebrew name of course too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">And uh, it was done by a doctoral dissertation by a German after the war, and he picked the Willners as one of the families that he did his dissertation on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">And so when I visited recently, uh, I knew this before I went that in months of August and September, they inviting Jews back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> as guests of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muchenglablak</span> , which have done some other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">My name wasn't on the list to be there, but since I was visiting on my own with my friends, I was passed on to some city officials to tell me someone visiting early and they made a joke of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">They got their dates wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">And, uh I didn't get the dates wrong because this was a personal visit | was making to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and some other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">And uh, I agreed that I would see some city officials who wanted some advance information on what a person like me who comes back to his former <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> would feel like. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">They had a lot of apprehension that for instance, one person in '85, an old lady, wrote them a letter and said, what is this good for, why reopen old wounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">Why are you inviting us back here? </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">Well, to make a long story short, out of the people they invited, probably about 90% of the people are coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">As the guests of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , for one week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">Uh, they were very apprehensive, and really wanted to know, particularly from one who got the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">In other words, they are inviting people back who escaped <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">They are Holocaust survivors, but they were either in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> , in uh <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> or some other <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">But they didn't know how many had been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">Since I had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and uh, also probably am one of the youngest, if not the youngest, I was told, in the group that was coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">They wanted to know how I would feel about this, how I would feel about collective guilt, which by the way, I don't believe in collective guilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">There are also good Germans just as well as there are bad Germans, and I am sorry to say that I've seen people in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ... END OF TAPE but then he said I'm very hesitant to do this, but I see that you are interested in this, that you're into what happened to your family, that you went in search of your family after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">I have a book that recently came out that the German government put out that has about 150,000 names, 125 or 150 thousand I don't remember exactly of German Jews that perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">Conclusion of Interview. </span>
