<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None</p>
<p>ANSWER: None</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Thank you, thank you for having us here -- thank you for having me, I’m not an us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Can you first just tell us when and where you were born? </span><span class="sentence" id="3">Let’s stop -- we -- I just heard the --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Right, Ginetta, te -- can you give us your official date of birth, and where you were born? </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Yes, I was born in -- near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , in a little <span class="NPIP">place</span> called San Columbano Olumbro, little f-fatsioni of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , now it’s a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , on June first, 1923.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  And can you tell us something about the life that you led before you got into the Resistance? </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Yo -- I know that it was a rather complicated and interesting time for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  It was complicated, and at some level, it was also a good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And one of our circle of frien -- the circle of friend, the most important thing was the circle of friends we had, all anti-Fascist, and all active in assisting people who had been persecuted by the Fascist party. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Yes, Jewish, but the Fascist party was also persecuting people who were anti-Fascist. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">It just happened that many of the anti-Fascist were also intellectual, and intellectual are more likely to be critical. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Until 1938, it wasn’t too difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Then, when the Nazi law were adopted by Mussolini, in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , there was a great deal of criticism about Mussolini doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And yet, the discussion I vaguely remember, in our circle of friends, particularly when we went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , climbed everythi- if it was a day, that it was not very clear, they talked, they talked, they talked about political issues, social issues, anti-Fascist persecution. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">The general atmosphere was that even some intellectual had signed some paper approving of Mussolini adopting the Nazi racial law, and that was 1938, so I was pretty young, and to be very honest with you, there were times when I were -- yes, I was interested, but I wanted to climb, I wanted to hike, I wanted to sing, I wanted to have a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I was touched by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">At the same time, I also wanted to have a good time, going to look for ackenberry, for example, in August, and have ackenberry pies, and for -- in the <span class="INT_SPACE">refuge</span> , and -- or rather, I have never forgotten that the criticism of the Nazi law was not only done by educated people, but there were also a farmer who taught 1-11 pladoni, Mussolini didn’t have much hair, so they called him il pladoni, he is crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">He is doing -- you know, why is he doing this, why is he going after the Jews, wh-why is he doing that? </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And then, in the discussions, and as I said, I heard not only within my family, but also in my -- the circle of friends, who were personal friends, all interested in mountain climbing, all interested in going to refugi for hikes. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Near the lake of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Como</span> , there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Laigreenai</span> , and there were refuges where we went, and we had to carry our food in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Ex -- there were some supplies left there, brought by donkey, like polenta, rice, potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">But -- and the farmer would have milk, a -- etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And then we would hike, and then the discussions. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Yes, there was discussion of movies, there was discussion of <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , there was discussion of opera. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">There were discussion of work in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">There -- but also, there were always political discussions, and invariably, we found- at least I experienced the fact that people had joined the Fascist party because they had to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Tha -- they were very few who would disagree, and -- and there were big discussions. “</span><span class="sentence" id="28">Hey, you stupido, cretino, that you believe in these idiotesa, that is -- we don’t like the German.” </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Well, I didn’t like when they said, “I don’t like the German,” generally. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I made -- and my parents taught me, and my friend taught me, then -- there has to be a distinction between the pro-Nazi and the German. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And, there was a discussions, very early, about the fact that some German people, yes, they were Communist, and Socialist, but they were also member of the upper class. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And some bishops, who, when Hitler began the persecution of the Jewish -- the anti- Fascist -- anti -- there were Communists, Socialists, and Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And it just happened that many intellectual were also Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">At that time -- I was very young, but I remember the heated discussions about Hitler, as announced in the press, that he has opened a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , to put those people in. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">It was very difficult for young people to understand what it meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">The -- some of the friends that I had, who were older, mature, and who -- and my parents, they were aware of the Fascist party having a special tribunal, 1-1 -- where the Fascist didn’t have courts of law for those anti-Fascist, anti-Nazi -- f -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> <span class="BUILDING">courts of law</span> for those anti-Fascist, anti-Nazi -- f -- in Italy, was anti-Fascist, but you understand, then, they were against both. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And instead of a <span class="BUILDING">court of law</span> , with judges, which of course many of the f- the Fascist had nominated those people, but nevertheless, the special tribunal could condemned anyone, that when that person -- and there were women, too, became quote, suspect, the special tribunal had the special Italian Secret Police, called Ovra, O-v-r-a, to investigate the suspect. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And I remember one particular day, when they were discussing this, we couldn’t go up climbing, we couldn’t go hiking, it was raining, and -- and they were discussing all this -- I mean, it sounds s-strange thing, that this suspect could be man or the woman, and then the Ovra could pull in, for interrogation, the baker, the priest, the butcher, friends, associates of the work, whether they were engineer, or doctor, or [indecipherable] and, I remember that they were talking about some people were killed, executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Some people were sent to what was known -- oh, some people to San Vittory prison, something, somebody sent to remote area in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> <span class="BUILDING">San Vittory prison</span> , something, somebody sent to remote area in Italy, where these people who were intellectual, writer, artist, doctor or lawyer, could not see the family, except maybe once a year, twice a year, I can’t remember correctly. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">But they were deprived of the mail, very rarely they could have the mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">They could only receive visits from the family very rarely. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">In other word, they were denied everything, and whether they were imprisoned in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Vittory</span> , or sent to these remote area, there was the attempt to isolate them from society, deprive them of their professional life, their French -- their family, their friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And the special tribunal had the power to do that, in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">But the German, apparently, were doing the same, and again I didn’t understand very clearly, except in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was a place, after 1933, where priest, Socialists, Communists, intellectual, could be sent, and the judicial system -- and they talk about the judicial system being damaged. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">The SS, and the Gestapo took over the function. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">That meant that it became very arbitrary, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And I also remember that both in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and I mention, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , if some big Fascist liked a woman, sometime they had the man investigated, so -- you know, in other word, an arbitrary, unjust, terribly painful process for the fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Now, that picture of the special tribunal, those memory of San Vittory, the exiled, 1t remained with me forever, for as long as I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But at the same time, we -- there was a great deal of joy. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">There was <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , the -- the hikes in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , seldom we went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Occasionally we went to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paylee</span> , and I learned how to watch the <span class="DLF">farm</span> -- the fisherman to bring in the fresh fish, and -- and have a meal with them, they made the mayonnaise with the garlic, and the parsley, and I wasn’t cooking at that time, but I watched them there, enjoyed the French eating, but <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> were the [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Short weekend was [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And, in addition to climbing, and we met -- we knew the Pastore, who had this wonderful bitar and then the cow, and they made the fresh cheese, and there was be -- song, in spite of the difficulty. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Now, the people --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  It was what? </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I didn’t --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Difficulties, in spite of the difficulties --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  There was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  -- there was joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  Joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  And the mountain club, the Italian mountain club, was a social equalizer. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">There were intellectual, very wealthy people. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Papa Bolla was the president of the Italian mountain club, the whole family, Leala, Rico. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">He was a businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">The Sturani -- nobility, Count and Countess Sturani, and then the worker from the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">There were engineer, there were geometry impligati clerks. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And, of course, we met th-the wifes, and the children participate. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">In fact, in one particular <span class="BUILDING">refuge Pialeral</span> , we built it. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And we had to maintain it, and you had to walk, after you arrived with funicular above <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Como</span> , you had to walk for four hours carrying your knapsack, and as I said, in summer they had donkey that they brought durable goods. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But otherwise, y -- and then you just roam around, and in winter it was skiing, but not the skiing of today, where you go up and down, up and down, can’t stand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Th -- the skiing was for sightseeing, for enjoy -- now, non-vacation was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Then, we went to -- went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nash</span> , we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherbania</span> , and there was one funicular at that time, and we went up to anolder tel colostum becko, and that again was a reunion place. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Summer was hiking all over, climbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And I began climbing with my parents and guides. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">They were very strict about guides. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">You don’t go up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> unprepared, because the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , like the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> is very harsh, can be very difficult, so you have to be prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And then we refuge.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  What does that -- what does that mean, refuge?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  Refuge -- refuge? </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Well, <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> where you bring your supply. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">You melt the snow with Sterno, to make [inaudible], and you bring dry fruits, and a pinyotta. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Pinyotta are dry cracker, but very hard on your teeth, you better have good teeth, or else you are 1n trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And, of course, the first day or so, you have fresh fruit also, but -- and, for the first day or two, you have slice of rosto polarose, but then you drive everything, and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">It was fun, it was climbing, it was hiki -- 1-1 -- picotsa, if there was a snow, you use the ice pick, as -- la picotsa, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">You had the scarponi, and so you go to refuge -- let’s take an example, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shamoni</span> , this was not -- this was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shamoni</span> , you go to -- by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ajohntierre</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ajohntierre</span> you start hiking, I remember cutting it, sta -- to your <span class="DLF">refuge</span> , le refuge de <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ajohntierre</span> , and you spend the night there, and the -- often the <span class="DLF">refuge</span> can offer polenta, or zupa -- soup, or polenta, occasionally risotto, but really polenta is more [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Also, they made, f-fontina [indecipherable], fontina toma. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So polenta was fontina toma, all fresh, goat cheese, or fresh whatever there was. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And you spent the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And it’s wonderful because there is a camaraderie, I think is the word. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Young people talk, talk about <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> and movie, talk about the love, talk about this, talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">The serious people talk about -- yes, some politics, or is -- Italian are very yeah, yeah, yeah, talk politics great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">But, also talk about traveling, talk about culture, talking about booksa, talking about history, talking about the meaning of some opera, for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And I remember in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ajohntierre</span> , we're talking about a performance in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> of Don Carlos, and how Verdi had a -- really used opera to express the essence of repression, a religious repression. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">The burning, the -- and then there were discussion over -- on religion, for example, because at that time, Voltaire was a prohibited author by the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So needless to say, we talk about Voltaire, and -- and also, the press was controlled. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I must confess that at that time, I was far more interested in boys and girls, I was far more interested in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , far more interested in having fun, and I had a good friend at that time, that I knew when I was seven, and he was 11, and he -- I heard all this, and I paid some attentions, but I must confess that my attention at that time, when I was so young, was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , in the fu -- wildflower. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I was crazy about wildflower, I -- I -- we went, as family and friends, to do le narche zarta, which meant we went to the refuge, and then we picked, very carefully, a bouquet of -- it’s daffodil-like, but white with a little red, little eye, and very perfume, not cheesy. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And you are taught conservation from day one. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And again, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> you talk about planning. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Let’s go for a narche zarta in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Como</span> next spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We take the picnic, we go. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Some people work for Las meerbiscoza for <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">What we discovered -- and while we were talking about fun in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , there was a great deal of politics all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Now, the best, active people, at the political level, were Socialist, and Communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Anti-Fascist, many of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And being Communist, but after having been in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> of Mussolini with the Communists, they changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">They followed the lead of two people, that I didn’t know, and I be -- who started a movement called jostitsia en liberta, the Rosselli brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And they were talking about the Rosselli brother as having taught them how common -- hard line Communism of the Stalinist-Leninist type was as dangerous as Nazi Fascist, and therefore they wanted, yes, Socialism, yes, a just society, due process of law. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">That was taught by lawyer, like Enrico Enpigi all the time, Contamessa -- Rainso Contamessa. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Due process of law, fair trial, and then -- and no military judges, like the special tribunal. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So there was this combination of hat -- la -- Ajohntierre was one. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And then we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> sometime for two weeks, from refuge to refuge, refuge to refuge, and guides, always guides. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">But you have the leisure of enjoying something very much, with a diversified company, from student, and young children, to factory worker, engineer, lawyer, professor, doctors, a-academic, some very serious were very angry about the academician who had signed the Nazi manifesto for 1938 duration of Mussolini. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And all in good humor, even those who were accused of being -- you are a damn fa -- you are an Fascist stonase, c’est une cretino, c’est qui -- the next day we climbed together, we ate together, we -- you know, it was not vindictive, it was not nasty -- yes, there were bursts of recrimination, but it didn’t become so sickening that hate, a -- hate --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Wh-Why do you think that was so?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  I don’t know, to these days. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Perhaps that question should be given to psychiatrists, or other. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I believe then the Italian culture, with so many occupation, for centuries, by so many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> -- you know, remember in <span class="REGION">Sicily</span> , the Swedes were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">In fact, there was a beautiful poem called, “Curradino dis vetsia.” </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And I have never forgotten a small part of that poem. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">The poem referred to a mother, 1n switzer -- in -- in swede -- in sw -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">You see, in springtime, a swallow return, and the mother ask the swallow what coming -- was coming from ita -- from the south, “Dimi iveesto il filio meo,” Tell me, have you seen my son, who was sent to fight in <span class="COUNTRY">Sicily</span> <span class="REGION">Sicily</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And the swallow answered, “Si, no veesto, erabuendo, erabianco, sotolarko diontempio era saipporto.” </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Yes, I saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">He was blonde, he was white, under the arch of a <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> he was buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And I remember the discussions around that poem, and I’ve always remembered that poem because it emphasized the commonality of human being, but here it was from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> invading <span class="COUNTRY">Sicily</span> <span class="REGION">Sicily</span> , and then of course, we had the Berber invading, and the French, and the Austrian invasions. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And each invader brought destructions, pain, suffering, but also the need for some people to get together and help each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And I have a feeling that that common bondage of seeing so much suffering, and [indecipherable] destruction the pope’s rector, in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> one must- I mean, there were powers, and corrupt, and -- so ou -- in one sense you were devout Catholic, went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , you practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">You had also many skeptics, and the selling of the images, and all those things, were discussed, I mean, they talked about everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> was a teaching place, because of the situation that here you are up in a <span class="INT_SPACE">refuge</span> , and you’re having your time, but I don’t [indecipherable] leisure to talk and think. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Not that I understood very well everything, far from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">But it’s amazing how later things seems to connect. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And I remember when they were talking about the special <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> , the prisoner in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Vittory</span> , the persecution of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">The injustice of having a judicial system with three military judges who had the power to bring in everybody to 1 -- to interrogate, intimidate, frighten friends, family, butcher, maid, you name it. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And I thought, how can they do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And yet, there was the other side of helper all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  Helper?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Helpers, all the time in San Vittory, which was a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Vittory</span> , which was a prison for criminal, and for political prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And the political prisoner, I think Grandshe may have also been there, they had a great deal of help from the suaray. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">First of all, the sister were there, the doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And the suaray play, a- were nurses at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And inside -- and these were people hired by the Fascist party, but we always found people -- the bakers, God bless the bakers -- we always found people who could help. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I have the feeling, listening from the discussion, from my parents, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Enrico</span> [indecipherable], all those people, that in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , it was easier to help than it was possible to do in aust -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">In -- 1-in Nazi Germany, they in fact, destroyed all of the antique -- Nazi -- much more easily than they could in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and I think it may have to do something -- but again, I’m not a historian, I’m a re -- an ordinary woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">My feeling, listening to the other, was that the German were cultured, music, but also disciplinarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And they treated children with 11 maganello, with a stick, as they grew up. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And therefore, that could have had an influence in the rigidity of behavior of that particular -- of -- of the German, that although there was resistance by some in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , by intellectual, like Bunoffer, but, in the resistance had networks, mostly of Communists, and Socialists. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">They were wiped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">They didn’t have the support than their counterpart in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> had from the general population. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And we split, within the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  Could -- could you just give -- give me a sense of your education beyond the more -- somewhat more formal education, because I think it’s very interesting that you had such a wide and cultured education at a very young age, and it seems to me it must have influenced you as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  Well, first I had to work very hard, and studying. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">It’s okay to have fun, but you study. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And I had a -- oh, for two years, when we lived in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , which was called <span class="BUILDING">Santangelo de Jarno</span> , I had -- and I lived with a family -- my family, but als -- came very often, but I also had this wonderful family who was Istytotwiss. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And yes, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the elementary year, and I had marvelous teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Her name was Bentivania Lucia, and then she married a man whose name was Negrini. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And I think they were anti-Fascist, but in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the subject, history, writing, reading, she was very good, and just marvelous. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">She would inspire her student to do the best. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Still, when we had to do the essay, we had to praise Mussolini, and -- and she did that with a wooden face. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So we had to write our essay, how wonderful Mussolini was, and then in, I believe was ‘35, but you should check, when he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Ethiopia</span> , there was a horror in my -- all our circle about Mussolini invading <span class="COUNTRY">Abyssinia</span> , was called at that time, dropping poison. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And the Duca da Oustar, a family wi -- a -- being there too, I mean, there was a tremendous dispute. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Mussolini, of course, wanted an empair -- em-em-em-empire. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">The king went along with it, that idiot -- excuse the expression. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">If I understood correctly, the queen -- the wife was absolutely opposed to Mussolini, to his enterprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">She was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Montenegro</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elena</span> , and was a -- from what I’ve heard -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Tape one, side B. I’m sorry Ginetta.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  That’s okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Now, in [indecipherable] circle of friends, the rutsini -- the rutsini [indecipherable] rutsini were the parents of Mary Mullisanno. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Mary Mullisanno was married to Enrico Mullisanno. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Enrico Mullisanno’s brother was Pigi Mullisanno, who was married to a wonderful woman called Marcella. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Now, the rutsini were from monarchy, the Mullisanno were anti-Fascist, anti-king, 1s an idiot. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">But also they were praising his wife for her intelligence, for training her children to be useful in society, and not just idiots. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">In other word, they felt very strongly that -- the Mullisanno -- that the king was not worth anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I mean, yeah -- yeah, he was -- he went along with Mussolini, and critical, went along with signing the law, went along going to <span class="COUNTRY">Abyssinia</span> , went along with everything, and eventually went along with Mussolini becoming allies of the German, and al -- went along when Mussolini invaded <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in 1940, and throughout that, while the rutsini always defended the king, and bi -- praising the queen, of course, and the children, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">The Mullisanno said, the king goes along with Mussolini, so he’s equally responsible, and -- and ya -- that -- that kind of -- so, it was a fairment of ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">The essay we did in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had to reflect acceptance of Mussolini party line. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And it was obvious that the teacher was very skeptical, but she had to do it. [</span><span class="sentence" id="175">indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Then when I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I had to redo the whole damn thing -- excuse the expression. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">You know, Is -- what did you do today? </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And I said, well that’s what we did, that Mussolini went to <span class="COUNTRY">Abyssinia</span> to re- vindicate the destiny of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , I mean all that rhetoric, pretending the Fasci romani as if he had become -- a-and naming the king eventually, when the war was over, and [indecipherable] it was such a -- such a awful thing, that I was -- I learned that all this parade was -- was a charade, and although you couldn’t speak in public, among friend, that was discussed all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  But your parents then -- then asked you to rewrite your essay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  Yup. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So, you can see -- then, meanwhile I also had to learn in French, I had to -- but -- and there were wonderful travels. </span><span class="sentence" id="182"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and -- and I’m glad I learned French. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">History was very important, literature was very important, and victory go -- Montaigne, Monsieur Montaigne, wi -- Pascal. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I am glad I did, as well as Italian literature, as well as Italian poetry, like Danté, an old Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I-I am glad I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I didn’t understand as fully as my parents thought that I should. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Who can understand Dostoyevsky when you are so young? </span><span class="sentence" id="188">You know, the [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">But, I read them, and they always said, “One day, when you are 40, you will have to reread them all over again.” </span><span class="sentence" id="190">But meanwhile, I di -- I had to do it, and history was important, literature was important, and the Greek, as well as the Roman. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">The lives -- Plutark’s lives of the Greek, and the Roman. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And that was becan -- but that was also discussed among the people with who -- if we are stuck in the refuge one day, or discuss Cicero, [indecipherable] that was part of growing up, somehow, and -- and looking back, it was a good education. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Looking at what my children got in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atherton</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> , and before, they don’t have education. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">They don’t have history, except some minor history. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">American history, which is very important, they should study more. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I’m -- we -- in other word, I could only understand how fortunate I was, how rich our -- and I’m talking about ours, not just my -- they gives you, in spite of Fascism, in spite of a dictatorship, in spite of the war, they give you a -- a -- a little richer background to understand lives, to understand other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , to understand other culture, to understand politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And -- and I guess from that respect, I felt I was a fortunate woman -- now, I mean, in the last 15 - 20 years, I understood what a fortunate person I -- I have been, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So, the life in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was a happy one, until really the war started -- the -- ’38 was the beginning of difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">QUESTION:  Can you describe that -- that change in some way”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">ANSWER:  Well, the first thing was that you have to be very careful never to say anything, and it’s kind of hiding, without hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And you know, you have to be careful only with your friend, don’t say anything to anybody else, don’t discuss politics, don’t discuss the racial law, don’t discuss anything about the fact that the Jewish people now are discriminated against, they cannot go to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , they cannot go to -- t-to -- in certain profession they are removed from the profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">People could not practice medicine or law, and -- and the Jewish children could not go to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , or to the regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Can you imagine if you are going to a regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and you are told sometime very nicely, sometime by people who felt pain in saying that, and sometime not so nicely, but you cannot come back? </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And then children taunt -- tau -- te -- you know, mock other children, who are Jewish, but not as many as I learned was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , or other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and that I learned it from other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Because in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , there was this mockery, but not mean, mean, mean, except by the Fascist, and there were not so bi -- so many which are vehement about the issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">So <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> had a -- had had an integration of the Jewish people with Italian, lots of intermarriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Nobody thought about that until Mussolini did that in 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  But Mussolini was in power in 1922.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  °22.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">QUESTION:  So ’38 changed something quite radically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">ANSWER:  Oh, absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">QUESTION:  And was that the racial laws that made the change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">ANSWER:  The racial law, yes, I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I think when Mussolini adopted the racial law, 1t was a turmoil within the society, and also the special tribunal, the political pers-persecution. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">In the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , in San Vittory, and in the confini -- confini are those people -- those <span class="NPIP">places</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Vittory</span> , and in the confini -- confini are those people -- those places where people were sent, and I remember my parents, my friends saying, imagine if you’re a doctor, a lawyer, a philosopher, a sociolo -- an intellectual. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Also well as a worker who is organizing for the Communist party, or the Socialist party. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">They didn’t persecute the [indecipherable] party, not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">But those people are deprived of all contact, family, friends, reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I mean, those people read newspaper, republication, often they w -- spoke other language, like English, and French, and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Imagine being deprived of everything? </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And be isolated, and you haven’t done anything wrong, you’re innocent. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And then when the special tribunal even sentenced people to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And there were women, also, who had been condemned to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Now, some women, I understood -- and again, one should do research on that -- I understood that some women were sent south, a-and they -- sometime they were hired by well-to-do family, as maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">But they were separated from their family, their children, their husband, who say, if you didn’t -- if you stayed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and you took care of me and the children, you did not have to worry about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And some were kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">There are some cases where I heard that the woman who gave them the job, was very sympathetic, very supportive, very helpful, particularly when during the visit, the ha -- she saw the husband treating the wife, because -- if you stayed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you wouldn’t have had this, and you have th -- you caused me so much grief. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I have to cook, you caused your children so much pain, and blah, blah, blah, and she became very supportive of this exiled woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Now, I don’t know about the [indecipherable] cases, you know, one should look into -- into that, but it struck me once again human being are capable of great love, human being are capable of great caring, concern, and there are some who’re not. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And my feeling at the time, when I learned from my parents, from my friends, from the people I was surrounded with, was that it makes a difference if you’re persecuted, and there are people who cares about you. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And that began with a basket of roasted chicken, and thing that -- fruits -- and other -- than my parents, and other, brought to San Vittory at the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , and -- and also to people who are very poor, because there was a great deal of poverty at that time, and Mussolini was encouraging women to have a lot of children -- a lot of children to provide sons to go to war, essentially, cause he was always in t -- trying that, and -- and things were bad, but then, when Mussolini met Hitler someplace, I think it was the <span class="DLF">Brenner Pass</span> , and must have been close to the beginning of the war, maybe a couple of years earlier, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Again, the propaganda was all in the hand of the Fascist [indecipherable] and the radio, there was no television. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Osana about the alliance between Mussolini, and -- and at that time, the open hostility and contempt for the Jews, the propaganda began, to the point when Jewish people began really to es -- try to escape, to get abroad, to -- but what struck me was, when we went [indecipherable] within smuggles, and friends, and the biter, the Pastore, you know, the enormous compassion, and the enormous anger at wik Fascistoni -- there was -- were Fascistoni means big Fascist. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Because before, many people had accepted -- they were against the alliance with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from day one, because of the memory of World War One, because when German and Austrian soldier were captured as prisoner, farmer family treated them well. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Apparently, when the Italian prisoner of the German came back, they had horrible story to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I was too young, but I have heard from -- from -- one we thing that happened at that time, that has remained with me very vividly, about wars, the occupation, that I mention so many French, Austrian, Berber, Swedish, that si -- that the memory of the occupation by the Austrian was very vivid when I was a child, because after all, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> was occupied by them. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">The Aousta family, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piedmont</span> -- regained <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piedmont</span> , the Aousta family, in 1849. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Then, in 1859, is when finally <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lombardy</span> was freed. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">You know, if -- andre dios 1s nothing in human history, but my parents took me to see a little <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lombardy</span> not very far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> , and there are many of such <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> throughout <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lombardy</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piedmont</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And these little <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> , plain, there is usually an image of some saint or something [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Then there is a <span class="DLF">grate</span> , and inside the <span class="DLF">grate</span> , there are bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And the bones are the bones then the farmer founds, either in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piedmont</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lombardy</span> , people who died in the war in 1848, in 1858 - °59. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And the farmer found so many, then they erected this little <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> as a memorial to the people who died, but that memorial is a reminder that war is a horrible thing, and -- and people sometime bring matsolini di furey. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">If you pick up some poppy, and bachelor button, and -- you know, and it’s a ca -- and then there 1s a -- a charo, there is a -- a candle, you know, those -- and then they put, and -- and this is done spontaneously, nobody is in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">But my parents reminded me then, this was a way to remember those horror, and hopefully it doesn’t happen again, but they also talk about Hitler, and Mussolini, but they also talk about Stalin. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">They felt that Stalin, and Hitler, but like this, Mussolini was considered a buffoon, less ideological, although he did put nula osta to the deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And it was not until after the war, when I met Angela Dinati, then we talk about the role of Italian Army of occupation in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , and [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Now, already were -- throughout the world, there were letter coming from soldier Italian, in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , and they crying the horror of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nazi death camp</span> , through letters, which, although there was censorship, nevertheless, it was brought out, and everybody talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">It was like one of those telegram -- verbal telegram tree, then everybody -- no. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Admittedly, the retay may have been difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">An interesting thing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="252"><span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> had censorship, but many Italian censor made a point of passing some of the material to the anti-Fascist groups, and probably also to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I only know the anti-Fascist leadership, Communist, or Socialist, parti [indecipherable], were recipient of those letters from Italian soldier who decried the horror of Italian being associated with the German in this horrib -- horrendous enterprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">It’s against all the Italian history, culture, ence religious figure [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And that’s where the split in the religious community took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And the ambiguity, and the lack of clarity, with the exception of some priests, who actually gave their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Norman Zofti, I think was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">One priest in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , I know that he was shot in a -- in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , that’s a-another -- another period, but it was during the occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">But again, there was this divisions, and of course there were many skeptics, although they were Catholic, and there were many Catholic who did everything to help the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">But they couldn’t give back the jobs, the jobs were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">You know, the professor of the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> were removed, and doctor were -- yes, they practiced, but 1-in official universe medical school, etcetera, 1t was the Catholic doctor who took over, and some of them were wonderful, and some of them found even way to send patients to this Jewish doctor, so then they could make some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">But above all, it was a time to begin looking for safe <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I’m going to take a break, because I have to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , but I also want to show you that little red book, because two years ago, three years ago, when I went back to the -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">archive</span> with the cardinal -- we [indecipherable] then I ask Julianna, would she please take me to see some of the conven -- the <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION:  Okay, let’s take -- let’s take a break. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">We’re back from our break, we all -- we took a walk in the beautiful <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Ginetta, I wanted to ask you, when the racial laws were promulgated in 1938, did you actually -- you were what, 15 years old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  13 - 14- 15 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">So did you feel the real difference that happened when Mussolini is moving towards an alliance with Hitler, and when the racial laws came in, did you feel that, did you understand what was happening, that there was a real difference from you had experienced before under -- under Mussolini?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">ANSWER:  Not fully. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Not fully, and there was that sense of uneasiness. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">There was s -- you know, you play with other children, and some -- very few, but -- would make some comments about Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I would say there was a quiet sense of fear, a little bit, uneasiness, uncertitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Your world had changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">It seems that you had to be careful about everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">That carefree wonderful feeling, yes, there will be uneasiness, for a [indecipherable] something changed, and I cannot describe it very well, except there was a sense of uneasiness, and probably looking back, hidden fears. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">You are not fully -- not fully understand why, but it’s there. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And then, a-as I said, we read the newspaper, we listened to the radio, and of course, we didn’t believe in it, but the propaganda was there, day after day after day. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And I do remember that we listened to the BBC hiding in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , because it was against the law. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">The other thing that my parents always did, and friends always did, every time they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> skiing, like from bart to lunch, going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zermot</span> , etcetera, they always tried to bring back a -- a pass from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , and I tell you, you do develop a love for the free press when you -- you pass it around from one to the other, and then -- oh, you only have t -- one day, then you have to give it to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">It was just that, 1f you are afirmati, you were so famished for news, which were not the propaganda lying of the Fascist. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And I -- I ha -- you know, I -- I believed then one of the reason I treasured article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, was freedom of expression, which I still believe is one of civilization highest achievement. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Now [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Shall we take a break? </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Yes, someone has entered the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and we’re going to take a break. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Okay, we’re now back from our second little break, and I -- a friend of Ginetta’s brought in a Amnesty International award that has a -- some of the barbed wire from the escape experiences, and we’ ll talk about that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Ginetta, I wanted to ask you, di -- when you were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , did you n -- did you notice the Jewish kids who were not able to be in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> any more? </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Any of your friends?</span></p>

a terrible war. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">All young people were drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I must make a point here, than many young people who are Fascistoni, big

they were letting their family know, and of course not everything came true, and the censorship was very strict, but we have to remember that among the censorship there were also people who were Italian, and Italian being Italian, and member of the -- letter go through, so that we seems to be aware at that time -- not that I understood it, far from it. </span><span class="sentence"

<p><span class="sentence" id="579">ANSWER:  <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Bicycle</span> , you know, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tubes</span> , or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> where you sit, in between, to put the messages, because <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ"> Bicycle</span> , you know, the tubes, or the seat where you sit, in between, to put the messages, because bicycle was a very common thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="580"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Trams</span> were working when there was no bombing, but if there was a bombing, there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trams</span> , so that you walk, or you go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , you’d go. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And what was extraordinary was a network which didn’t have much structure -- it had a structure, the thing was that the structure was very loose, and chow Gino, chow Pierro. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">You didn’t have a clue who chow -- who Pierro, or Gino, or whoever was, except for the leadership. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And then there was the Communist party, the Socialist party, the partito retsioni. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">The democrat -- Christian democrat, thesort. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">They all -- s-some of the top people were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">At the [indecipherable] <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were working, obviously they had contact with, and very careful about the possible spy within the <span class="BUILDING">headquarter</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piazza Italibalbo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Ba -- by the time I was there, everybody was so discouraged. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I mean, the employee, the career people, were so discouraged. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And when, then, the ally came to <span class="COUNTRY">Sicily</span> , my group, right there, opened a bottle of champagne. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And they were very sensitive about the career people who were there to do a job, their family was in <span class="COUNTRY">Sicily</span> <span class="REGION">Sicily</span> , or in the south. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And what struck me was the sense of compassion, then, everybody had about people who had to serve, to get the paycheck, divided with -- you know, from the family, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">There wasn’t hatred. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And I do remember -- this is later, in September, when one of them said, “Signiorina, who’s going to pay my salary now?” </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I would like a break.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">QUESTION:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Gonna take a break now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="597">ANSWER:  I don’t know --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  We’re back from our break. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Ginetta, can you describe some of what was being written in the underground press?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="599">ANSWER:  Yes, one of the goal of the underground press was to bring to the attention of the Italian under the occupation of the Nazi Fascists, what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Arrest, execution, deportation, often with the name of people, and also the public edict of the Nazi, and the Fascist, telling citizen that unless they cooperated, then the penal -- spelling out the penalty, also the reward. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">For any allied POW, there was a certain amount of salt, if I recall correctly, some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Also promise of release of a family member who was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in exchange for turning in allied POW, or Italian who were anti-Fascist and awaiting the draft. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So our goal was really to -- to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And every party, every political party had their own newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">One of the newspaper then, I enjoyed very much helping with in the distribution was noey darnet. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">We only had four members, but wonderful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And I also think that that was a maturing step for all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Noey darnet. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Thinking about the havoc wrought in the people -- Italian people’s lives, men, women, and children, by Fascism, and how are we going to rebuild a des -- destroyed society. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Mussolini intent was essentially to have women keep their <span class="NPIP">place</span> , produce many children. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Women were not allowed to reach higher echelon of education. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">But they were -- women were praised and given incentive to produce more and more children. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">At one point also, the women were asked to give their wedding band, gold, in order to pay for the war material, and the queen did her duty, and put her ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Later on we learned that many of the Fascists simply put a lot of the gold 1n their pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I don’t know if it was true or not, but it -- it’s irrelevant. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">The other thing we had to do was to give copper, our copper pots, to be used for cannon. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And boy thi -- that turned women off, not to have your cooking pot, nice, heavy, often from grandparents, and from the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , etcetera, to have to turn them in to make cannon. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">The other group of women, who were politically sensitive, and better organized, were limondinae. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Those were wonderful young women who, for the period when the rice needed to be weeded, would leave their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and go into <span class="DLF">farm</span> , big <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And this big <span class="DLF">farm</span> would have huge <span class="NPIP">places</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> which are not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> , they were simply sack cloth filled with straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And the women would go, I don’t remember how long, but they could go for the period of mondini to weed the rice, which meant being in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> with leeches on their feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And these women became quickly organized by the Communist party to fight Fascism, and their horrible conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">They had their own newspapers too, but I do -- the one I knew was jewsteetsa liberta, no dominae, partito retsioni. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">The student paper, and -- and it was an -- a clandestine effort, needless to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Paper was very scarce, and we were grateful to all the newspaper people who were employed in the regular [indecipherable] sera, yeah, for clandestinely making available to us, some precious, precious paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Are you worried about the tape?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">QUESTION:  I’m checking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">ANSWER:  So, it was a -- a dangerous thing to do, because if a member of the gopper -- gopeesti, those who [indecipherable] an assassination against a target of the SS, the Gestapo, and other, if they were caught, they were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">That -- the Nazi Fascist put a premium on arresting, catching, and torturing for interrogation, people who were involved in distributing the clandestine press, how did they organize, where was it printed, who 1s doing it, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And gathering the information for the clandestine press, which was done by a network of people, men, women and children, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railway</span> , the bill of [indecipherable], you know that kind, and also the insignia on the German, and trying to more or less to see if there had been changes, an increase. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Anyone caught in that kind of work automatically was a suspect for interrogation and torture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">QUESTION:  So anyone who was -- who had information, who -- and who was distributing information, and learning about what was going on, was in danger, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And that’s when I began treasuring the freedom of the press.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">ANSWER:  And also caught listening to the BBC, it meant deportation, or interrogation. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">In other word, the -- they put a great deal of emphasis on catching people who were providing information, education, exposing the horror, than they were doing -- although they were very stupid in many way, because on one occasion --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Let’s bl -- let -- hold that story, I -- because the tape is going to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">One second. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ginetta Sagan, conducted by Joan Ringleheim, with -- on Friday, September 24", in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atherton</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">This is tape number three, side one. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Ginetta, on the last tape, you started talking about an incident where they were very stupid.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">ANSWER:  They were very stupid. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Well, in general, you know, they were -- they were very -- they were expert in the art of interrogation, at -- at one <span class="NPIP">level</span> , because, instead of being selective, every suspect was tortured. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">They missed opportunity for getting information, because people died, or people simply decided no way, I’m going to die anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And one of the thing that must be said about the stupidity is, and for the first time, the SS and the Gestapo brought torture, not as an isolated incident, as the Ovra had used, or the police had used [indecipherable] any time, any <span class="NPIP">place</span> , anywhere, that is a systematic system of interrogation. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And it -- torturing people to obtain information which could be useful, became routine, and that was stupid, because they really tortured many people who didn’t know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And then they were hanging people publicly, in the gallows, shooting them. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">The other stupidity that they did, horrendous stupidity was -- not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , but abatsaboto, they caught -- there were something like 50 -- appro -- 50 - 54 partisan, including a pregnant woman, and they made that group travel from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and then they executed them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liguria</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genoa</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genoa spitsa</span> , there is another place where they took something like 40 or 50 young men, and publicly th-they executed them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And now, when I’m using the word stupidity, is because far from frightening -- yes, people were frightened, people are terrorized, but also people said, what? </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Even many Fascists said, I don’t want to be associated with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">This is not <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And true, with the Nazi, there were the Italian Fascist, SS, the libreen, rigatinari, the mouti, the dechamamas, who as volunteer, joined the SS unit, and they were the one who knew Italian, they were the one who knew the addresses to take these people, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I use the word stupidity because it really increased our ranks. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">People who had said, “No, I can’t help you, I’m too frightened, not for me, but for my family -- what can I do to help?” </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And I suspect that in any underground movement, but I -- I only know <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , when there is this kind of naked brutality, people will emerge, who will take far higher risk to help the victim than they had been willing to risk before. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And the reason I felt strongly about the underground press, although I’m not a journalist, but of course the Ritsini was a journalist family, pro-monarchy, I suspect possibly pro-Fascist in the early period, but certainly against this kind of brutality, and they were a great help in understanding that some conservative, from monarchy, etcetera, maybe proconserva -- they don’t accept such brutality, and -- and had to -- had to the paper -- now, our workers -- thousand of people was to paste notices, and -- and oo -- at that time, we had to make- to mix flour with water, and pinello, and go -- and that was very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And then distribute the clandestine press every <span class="NPIP">place</span> we could, in the fabrica factory, <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , <span class="BUILDING">school</span> <span class="BUILDING">fabrica factory</span> , office, buildings, school. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">Now the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , the student had their own newspaper, but we have to remember then, most of the professor had been forced to flee, to hide, and so we, as a student hiding, had some time became captive audience to professor who cou-couldn’t teach, and if we were hiding someplace for few days, let me tell you, we did have good professor. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I mean, discussions were marvelous, and unforgettable. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">You may forget something that you do in the regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you don’t forget something that you learn under the circumstances, debates, pro and con, and sometime deliberately, they chose one or the other to take the opposite point of view for arguing a case, for arguing a point, for arguing an essay, for arguing a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And between that, and assessing the press, evaluate it, analyzing it, and then come up with a synthesis that reflected the truth in very short space. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I believe it helps to consolidate your thinking in a way that nothing else since has ever helped me to consolidate ideas, and --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Do you have a recollection of any particular debate, or -- during this time? </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Was there any --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah, oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">The debate, at one point, centered around the role of people who had been part of the great concit of the Fascists, and then in July, turned against Mussolini, which caused, of course, the fall of Mussolini. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">The role of the king, accepting to be emperor, accepting Fascism all those year, in spite of the terrible cost to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , to the Italian people, and what should be the post- war or -- of those people who had been Fascist, which of course, I believe that as soon as the Nazi came to power, tried to erase them, and executed some, like Galliazo Channo, and -- and other, or the king, for post war. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">There were pro and con, and then debate about, so -- th-th-those were political discussion, and I have not been used to, and listen to people who had been professors and -- and student. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">It was interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">It was a learning lesson in politics, for when -- I made up my mind that I would have never -- nothing to do with politics after world war -- I would have to do something with protecting human right, and freedom of expression. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And then the other discussion was about the slogan of the Communist, from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ural</span> to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Atlantic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Is that what we want for Europe? </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And the answer, a couple said absolutely, because they provide social and economic right. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Other felt like <span class="NPIP">hell</span> we want from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ural</span> to Atlantic, to have Stalinism, and Leninism, in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Well, but the French wants that. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Well, the Italian don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Some did, but even the Italian who had been Communist, like Leo Baliani, and other, in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> of Mussolini, changed, and decided it was not good for the Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And in fact, no -- Ricardo Lombardi, Leo Baliani, Federucho Parray, they all agreed that the principle of socio-economic right is important, but so are civil and political right, and the two shall be linked. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And so the discussions was often heated. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Then there was a discussion about why should we accept funds from the American -- from the allies, in the conduct of the underground in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , to assist prisoner, family, as well as assist the partisan. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">The air drops, also money from <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> , and from -- funds from the army left over, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">We should have nothing to do with funding from the allies, or somebody said that we -- the Russian are sending tons of money for the -- for the Communist, for the propaganda, for everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So the discussion were often heated on that subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And our feeling was that we have to win this war first. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And then the political system that <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> will have, will have to be decided by the Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">The most important thing we should ha -- must have, is a constitution. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And so then there were the professor who -- who knew laws, and knew the -- then we read the Declaration of Independence, and the Bill of Rights, and oh, this 1s what we should have, and -- but the most thing -- everything agreed on no more dictatorship, and then brought into the question, what about the Marxist Leninist, that’s a dictatorship. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Oh yes, but that is a dictatorship of the proletariat. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Does he allow freedom of expression? </span><span class="sentence" id="689">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Yes, but he provides social and economic right. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Work for everybody, <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> for everybody, food for everybody, and my question was, at what price? </span><span class="sentence" id="692">So, here we are -- sometime the bombs were also falling, and having this discussion. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">But essentially I came away with a sense that open debate is crucial. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">But personally, I will never tolerate any dictatorship, no matter what the justification 1s -- is given by a government, period. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And I didn’t care if it was right wing, or left wing, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Any government, then want to impose a dictatorship on their people, in as far as I was concerned at that time, does not deserve to be respected, or supported. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">But to do that, you need the help of everybody to understand, to begin with, the danger, then this government represents. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And they will always find excuses, I mean, Mussolini was giving us all the excuses, Hitler was giving us all the excuses. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Hitler wa -- Stalin was giving us all the excuses. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And what was the result? </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Suffering for everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">QUESTION:  Can you explain to me how, or what it was then, that made you say, I will never get involved in politics, but I will get involved in issues of human rights? </span><span class="sentence" id="703">What -- what was for you at that moment, if you can go back there, wha -- what was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="704">ANSWER:  Well I realized that here were people that I loved, intelligent, dedicated, who truly believed that in the future, when the war was over, to obey the order of Stalin, for the good of the Italian, was essentialed to reveal our society in amoda, which would be different than Fascism. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I was unable to accept that. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">The other was that there were some member of the Communist party began worrying about this kind of thing, and discussed this openly, and felt that the Roselli brother for just a salivita, and understood the danger that Marxist, Lenin, and Stalinism presented for society, we still wanted to change the socio-economic situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">That was freedom, and not freedom of expression suppressed in order to achieve the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">In fact, we felt at that time that Fascism was far more modern that Leninism -- Stalinist Leninism, and look what it has done. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">We didn’t know about many other things than Stalin had done, and we knew what the Nazi had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And analyzed, discussed, studied, compared, and all -- all the others were going to become part of political parties. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">All of them became political leaders. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">And it’s okay, it’s just that I felt there has to be voices outside of the political system, that you can say, I disagree with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And I remember -- I can’t remember who said this, and then later on I heard it after the war many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I think it was Voltaire. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I disagree with you, but I’m ready to die for your right to disagree with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I’m not certain it was Voltaire, but that’s what I thought at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">That’s what we thought at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">I disagree with you, but I’m ready to die for your right to disagree. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And we felt that post-war <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> had to be respectful of ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">That there has to be a government which respect the right of citizen, and not imprison them, not torture them, not have mock trial, not have the special <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Special <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> was the <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> than [indecipherable] Mussolini -- Ovra installed during the Fascist period where there were three milary -- military judges, no legal defense, no -- entrapment was the -- the word for any suspect. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">So, those are the idea that really consumed us, while we were all so activist in helping, in hiding, in pasting notices, or change slogan of the -- we knew then people were deported in <span class="DLF">railway tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="723">We were told that they were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And somebody wrote [indecipherable] Tedeschi, W. Tedeschi, and we will paint Abastoy Tedeschi, I mean, stupid things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">It -- it -- 1t was just perhaps childish, but we felt it was important, and boy if you were caught, you are shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">You know, th- that kind of -- that distribution of mater -- leaflet press, and also learning to communicate to others, if there was a -- a danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">The reason I made a copy of carla was because it’s a classic example of somebody who undertake a very important project on that ha -- on that history, that also how somebody let him know then somebody was searching him, and instead of explaining, if you read it, you get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And -- and [indecipherable] translated into English, so that you can -- is an example of hundreds -- hundreds, and ordinary people doing kind of strange things all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">QUESTION:  N-Not -- I don’t want to push this too much, but your interest in human rights, going back to that period of time, is it that you were trying to establish what you thought were the necessary conditions for a society, whereas politics sometimes undermined those necessary conditions? </span><span class="sentence" id="730">That you were -- that there was something about human life that you wanted to protect, whatever the political system was. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">So you weren’t interested in power, and accumulation of power. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">I du -- I’m trying to figure out what it is that was pulling you away from pul -- politics, into another world. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I don’t know whether --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  We have to say we, because I was not the only one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">QUESTION:  W -- wes -- yes, right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">ANSWER:  And I have emphasized the word we, we, we, because these were a group of people working together but who disagreed about the political system --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">ANSWER:  -- to succeed Mussolini in post-war <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="738">ANSWER:  And then we also learned that sometime funds coming in from the allies, and distributed to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , was distributed to every group, but we also learned that the Communists were also keeping money for the post-war re-organization of the Communist party. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And at the time when you have such horror going on, and you need every penny to help everybody, I felt, my God, I am no different than the Fascist. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">They are already beginning to accumulate money for power, for their control after. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And the slogan, from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ural</span> to Atlantic really made us uneasy. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Not just me, but Enrico Mullisanno, Pigi Mullisanno, Rainso Contamessa. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">They were Communists who were queasy about it, but they still felt that they owed obedience. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">So my response was -- and this was my response, obideerai -- craderai obideerai combaterai. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">To believe -- to believe craderai. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Obideera, obey, combaterai, fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And I said, what is the difference when with the slogan of Stalin, and the slogan of Mussolini, and the slogan of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Craderai, obideerai, combaterai. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And I said, we want a force [indecipherable] of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , which hopefully will reflect the freedom that every person is entitled to. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">The respect, the dignity. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">If you want to be a Communist, you should be a Communist, but if I want to be something else -- I respect your right, but you have to respect mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">You don’t imprison me if you are in power because I happen to have different view, political or religious, because we remember also the Inquisition. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And Italian history is replete with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">One discussion we had in the underground about torture was then the -- actually the Empress of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , not herself, but on the advice of counsel, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> had abolished the use of torture to extract information, and I believe it was the end of the previous century, and yet, 1t was reinstated when the Nazi came, eliminating the judicial system, taking over the judicial system, and -- and using torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">So, the discussion also centered about what the- the Austrian had done at the -- the end of the previous century -- not that Maria Theresa was necessarily enthusiastic, but she accepted the advice of her counsel to eliminate tr -- torture, and then, as Hitler comes to power, the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> lose juridical prerogative, due to the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , and the judicial system, for political reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And then they bring it to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And while cases of torture had always occurred, but this was systematic torture, and it was horrendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I mean, people -- the scream were heard in -- whether it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Biapaolocelli</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Torino</span> , La Camradeebeeasti, Aroust, every <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="759">It became an epidemic. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">But we thought about the possibility of that under a dictatorial regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And we felt a dictatorship can use this method, as the Nazi, the Fascists are doing, any <span class="NPIP">place</span> , any time. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">So in a post-war Italy, what we want is guarantee, and that will never happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And we’re thinking about <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="764">QUESTION:  Where were you living at this time? </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Were you still living with your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">ANSWER:  Oh, I -- I beg your pardon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="767">QUESTION:  Were you living with your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="768">ANSWER:  No, I didn’t see -- I couldn’t see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">So I -- the underground had a assistance program, and I was actually handling three <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Viama Kerajoya</span> , ’41. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">The concierge, Mrs. Columbo, was our friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Her brother-in-law was executed, was one of the partisan who, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railway</span> , who was helping to give us the correct bill of lading, instead of the bill of lading when the Germans said on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> coming in, whate -- instea -- they would put clothes in, but e -- as, in fact they were armament. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And that was very important to the allies, to know what kind of material the German were bringing in for the war effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And there was an army of young people, student and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Now, the brother of mis -- in-law of Mrs. Columbo was caught and executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Now, there were three <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> derain prepared by the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Don’t ask me, except that my little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was quickly -- an arch -- furnitch -- an architect came and fixed the <span class="INT_SPACE">cupboard</span> , and it was very well arranged. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Then there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor apartment</span> , that I was handling for a courier who came back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And then there was one on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fifth floor</span> that I never saw, except that when somebody came, was a special password, it was the <span class="INT_SPACE">fifth floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And only later, after the war, we realized then that was probably the OSS people. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And they kept everything compartmen -- compartmentalized. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Then, in addition to these three <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , we were in the -- another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in [indecipherable] few block further down, and a network of <span class="NPIP">places</span> where people could spend a night. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And it was all integrated with the work done by the Committee of National Liberation, and by the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> , by political party, by groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And each group was very independent of the other, so that -- for example, since I’m looking at Lydia, one little <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drunago</span> , the priest was wonderful, and he hid people in the belfry. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">But, it was a network of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Of course, once in awhile we were caught, once in awhile it was broken, and we lost people. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">There were deportation, and -- or a book this thick has name of Italian who were deported, and many of them didn’t come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And some were Jewish, and the other were Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And they came from all walk of life, and if you look at -- I -- I think I -- I may have given it to Stan for those -- but if you look at the ages, you can see, it was truly a popular movement, had all ages, classes, education, or lack of education. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Along the river Po, the -- the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , there are <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> , and -- there are <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> , and the network of people who knew the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pavia</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Biyaivino</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mortara</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novara</span> <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Po</span> <span class="RIVER">river Po</span> , the -- the river, there are boats, and -- there are boats, and the network of people who knew the woods, in Pavia, in Biyaivino, in Mortara, Novara, it was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">But again, the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> were very important, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">confessional</span> were very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And the people went to the confession, who had never gone to confession before. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">And they were certainly not confessing sin. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">It was a mean of communication, improvised very often, but what struck me was how people can sum up the courage to do things when they haven’t thought about doing, or they would ever to, or -- or regret, and of course, many of them were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">I remember one woman, a -- a peasant who hid in her <span class="DLF">farm</span> some people, and -- and when her husband was taken -- the reason I went to see her, with another member -- another student, was to bring some money, and to wins -- you know, see what she needs, and -- and I always remember, they had been married many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And she said, “He was such a good man.” </span><span class="sentence" id="796">He was such a good man. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">I still see her face. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Those things, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And I got tired in doing my work sometime, I -- I think about those wonderful, ordinary people. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">They will

<p>QUESTION:  Is -- is that wa -- because they were less suspect?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="880">ANSWER:  Well, the Nazi and Fascist were suspa -- suspecting everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">After all, remember that while we do it -- the peaceful work in assistance, there was also the underground then blew up the <span class="DLF">railway</span> , blew up the partisan -- the Italian partisan, the band then -- then formed after September, they attack German and Nazi Fascist post in order to get arms, because they didn’t have much. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">So they would organize, and some of the people who joined the partisan had been professional military people, particularly the Alpini in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baldosta</span> , the Alpini, who were very good at climbing, who were very good at exercise, and -- and the German and the Nazi Fascist were determined to- to get rid of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">But communication could not done by telephone, or t -- or e-mail, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">Everything was done by voice, at most one page. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">But it was very, very, very serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">And that was rare, terribly rare. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And code. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">We had one pad code, and I got it that once it was used, it goes in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wastepaper basket</span> , because that was the most secure way of communicating. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">I need a break.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">QUESTION:  Okay, we’re going to take a break. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">We are now back from our break. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">Ginetta, when I asked you where -- where you were living, you were talking about living apart from your parents after 1943, but I gather in 1941, you were -- when you -- when you went -- started working with the Resistance, you were living with your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">Can you describe --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, I -- I was living w-with my parents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , and I was able to see also my nurse, my wet nurse, in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And we stayed in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> , because the mil -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> was bombed night after night by the ally, especially August 1943, lots of bombing took place, and so we rented a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and I could see also my wet nurse, th -- at a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , like many thousand of Milanese, because many of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> were destroyed by the bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Transportations was destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">The <span class="BUILDING">building</span> blocked <span class="DLF">streets</span> , bi -- the ma -- the -- when they were bombed, all the material, the -- the rubbles. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Or whether [phone ringing]. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">Oh dear.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="899">QUESTION:  Okay, we’re back from our telephone break.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="900">ANSWER:  Okay, now, at that time, July, August, af-after the Mussolini fell, it was chaotic in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , and in addition to the kills -- political kills, there were the bombing by the allied, especially in August, 1943, and waves after waves of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bomber</span> came, and we stayed in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And we could see at night the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , red -- th-the <span class="DLF">sky</span> was red, and hear all these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> , and you know, you understand that in order to end this war, they had to bomb, because once again, although Mussolini was gone, Badoglio took over the government, Badoglio with the king, and he said, la guerra continma, and it was not an -- so people had to get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> or industrial centers, even nearby, like sise to San Giovanni or other, and find <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">industrial centers</span> , even nearby, like sise to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Giovanni</span> or other, and find places in the country, it was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">The transportation was not working, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> were packed, whatever, it all -- it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">But we lived <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and then we came back, around the beginning of September, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , and it was at that time that -- and my parents told me that if anything should happen, and there should be a ashugamano, a ashugamano, this is to dry your hands, a -- a cloth, on the <span class="DLF">window</span> , I should not go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but should go and see Enrico Mullisanno if possible, or -- so, on September, my mother gave me some money to buy some sweater from Louisa Spanoli, which is still existing, and it was going back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , to prepare for going back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> possibly, but everything was in chaos. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And I went, and I had this money, and the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was closed, so I had this cash on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And then when I arrived <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I saw the ashugamano on the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and there was a black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And we call them the black maria, which were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> used by the police to pick up Jewish people, or anti-Fascist. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And we had, in a family living nearby, and the father simply had vanished. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And in August, in spite of the bombing, my father had asked me to drive his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , to drive the children of this family, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valdentelvi</span> , and stay with our friend Hua Pastore, and bring the children to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> with the help of Tonio, who was a smuggler, and the Pastore, who were dear, dear friend, an elderly couple who [indecipherable] known for many, many, many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And try to do what I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">He gave me some money, and you know -- then, in September, I realized I couldn’t go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so it was getting late, and there was a curfew, so I -- there was a bombed out building, and I remember a -- something dangling, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> , or something dangling with the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> from the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> , and it was a bombed out place, and I -- it was getting late, I felt like crying, so I stayed in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> instead of trying to go all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Viatalaggio</span> , where the Mullisanno lived, because I realized it would have been too far away to go, and I may not make it, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was literally in chaos. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">The Fascists were beginning to look all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> for young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">The military people were trying to shed their uniform, be on civilian clothes, and trying to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to escape, and there were thousand of people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> in that situation, when the armistice was announced. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">Nevertheless, the police were still hunting people. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And -- and that was the last time, I -- I was never able to see my parents again after that, but then Enrico, and Mary, and all the other really embraced me, and -- and also, there were some funds, in cash then were available, but the underground, the Resistance took care of paying the rent, providing minimum for food, clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">Clothes were very difficult, everything was coupons, for food, coupon for this, coupon for that, and with the armistice, the king, Badoglio, and the government fled to the south, leaving the people, the navy, the army, the air force in shamble. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">The headquarter of the air force, where I had been working with Enrico, all these officers, they tried to take as much documentation as they could, so we were helping to put away stuff, and prevent looting. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">But people came in and too -- and looted everything they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">It was a horror, and few people can imagine what it means for a government allied with a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , like the Italian government allied with the Germans, and then have an armistice with the ally, who are the enemy, the American, and the British, and the other, and flee, leaving the people, the armed forces of all, asbandati, alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And the German had already suspected the armistice would come, and therefore quietly had already beg -- not quietly, everybody knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">They began sending via the Brenner Pass, SS, Gestapo Panzer. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And they are prepared the plan to take a -- intensify the cleaning -- ethnic cleaning of the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Simultaneously to arrest all the people who were suspect of being anti-Fascist, and anti-Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">And then, of course, to capture all people who had been in the navy, air force, army, or armed force, everybody, to be deported for labor -- allegedly, for labor, to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="924">So again, they used their tru -- th-the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railway</span> <span class="DLF">railway</span> , not to help people to come back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , or send them ba -- to transport [indecipherable] people than they took, allegedly for labor, and the immediate work of the Resistance was to organize assistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">And that organization was -- POW was let out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="926">When I met Leo Valiani, and spoke to him, as well as I spoke to Ricardo Lombardi and others, “How many people did the Italian ordinary people help to escape?” </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And he said, “Prissipoco diachemila.” </span><span class="sentence" id="928">App- Approximately 10,000 people, which did not surprise me. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">But people immediately helping everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">The -- the Italian military of all, air force, navy, mari, everybody, army. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">Jewish people, and a lot of POW, who were let out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were open, the prisoner of war were open, and so these young people, these prisoner, young and middle aged, disbanded all over they could go, seeking -- hiding in the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and every <span class="NPIP">place</span> , because the German began immediately trying to recapture them, and force the Italian military -- of military age, who had been in the services, immediately recruited them for deportation to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , allegedly for -- they were rebuilding things. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">So, it was chaos.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="933">QUESTION:  In this chaos, were you in danger because your parents were picked up? </span><span class="sentence" id="934">Were they looking for you, or didn’t they know you existed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="935">ANSWER:  I don’t think they knew I existed at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">But, it -- the Mullisanno, the Ritsini, Contamessa, and everybody else, who had alre -- was already organized with groups in the underground, already, but immediately they said, “Never go near your <span class="NPIP">place</span> , never go near your nurse, never go near your close friend.” </span><span class="sentence" id="937">No sisamide, we don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And above all, there was the work of organizing assistance, and that’s what we focused on, immediate assistance, because <span class="DLF">streets</span> were blocked by the German tank, few days, and they were looking for young people, for young men, ital -- and for Jewish people, and our job was to work with hundreds of other ch -- young children, women, men, to be the mobile telephone, human telephone from block to <span class="DLF">block</span> , and the German are blocking the Immocatcho, they [indecipherable], the German are blocking such and such a <span class="DLF">street</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tank</span> , few days, and they were looking for young people, for young men, ital -- and for Jewish people, and our job was to work with hundreds of other ch -- young children, women, men, to be the mobile telephone, human telephone from block to block, and the German are blocking the Immocatcho, they [indecipherable], the German are blocking such and such a street. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">The German are blocking such and such a <span class="DLF">street</span> , etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And to help people escape off -- unfortunately many were caught, because there was no way we could find civilian clothes for everybody, so we did the best we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">As far as POW, was e -- very difficult, because the shoes never fit, the clothes were too sm-small for those tall -- especially Australian, or -- but they w -- there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pavia</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Biyaivano</span> , there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , so many of the people were trying to escape, escaped to <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and then there were <span class="DLF">farms</span> , and then there were convents. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">Some convents, for example, were pilgrim at -- used to go through and find shelter to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> , or whatever.

<p><span class="sentence" id="952">ANSWER:  Well, it was not easy, because you had to have -- first of all, you would be -- I mean, we’re several <span class="NPIP">places</span> where we were living, working, hiding, and only the central group knew how to reach us, and the stuffetta, like I can mention one, Nino Benedetti, for example, he was only 15 or 16, he was extraordinary, Jako Padentichay, Meno Scapolla, or me -- and many f -- children of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , in cri -- 12 - 13 - 14- 15, and women. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">And [indecipherable] people, old people, young pe- it was a -- they would be sent to communicate with this <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , with this <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , with this <span class="DLF">farm</span> , with this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and say there are two paci, tre paci, une paco. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Paco was the word for a person, so, chi serrano tre paci, kari verrano en Viama Kerajoya. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Well, three packages, which were [indecipherable] Kerajoya, they didn’t tell us how tall they were, how fat or thin, or young, or old. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">And so the most important thing was trying to have food, which was very, very scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And here I have to tell a story, because it’s really -- we can laugh. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">The Fascist had a habit of preaching that we had to sacrifice for the welfare of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and we have to stick to your ration, etcetera, but we all knew then some -- not all, some were very honest, some believed in Fascism, and there were some who were very corrupt people. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And when you have a dictatorship, you will always have corrupt people. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And we knew then very often, they arrested people who had nagotsi a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> of fromage, fr -- cheese and salami, and prosciutti, but who were rationed, everything was rationed, or brought in from the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> , and there were often rice subtracted to the forced giving than the Fascists had implemented at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">You must give this, you make -- you work, and you produce five sacks of rice, well, one has to go to the government, and they came, and th -- to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and looked, and -- and checked, and counterchecked, and if a farmer had not pr -- given everything, and they found something, it was the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And deportation even at -- ot [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">Well, what we did, we found that one of these Fascists had a kashaday, a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> full of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Salami, cheese, so one -- Guido was his name, he and others org -- first of all, they requisitioned a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> from the Fascists, pretending to be Fascists. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">Then they went to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and they loaded everything they could find, and believe me, there was salami and cheese, prosciutto, and you name it, it was incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Butter, scarce as one can be. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Farina for polenta, rice. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Anyway, they made it available to us to use for the people who were hiding, and I must confess, and I was very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">I know then you don’t steal, but in these particular circumstances, I was very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And this is some of the food that we actually use, and we stored it with the help of Mrs. Columbo in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , where we could share it with other - and I have to confess that I gorged myself too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">QUESTION:  And how did people get to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="972">ANSWER:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="973">QUESTION:  I mean, h -- how was the network?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="974">ANSWER:  It was a -- it was a network of people, I wouldn’t know the name of the people who brought -- let’s say -- let’s take Viama Kerajoya, although I can -- there were many other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , I’m using this as an example. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Quickly, we were given three <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and plus another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in Viama Kerajoya, in another <span class="BUILDING">building</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Viama Kerajoya</span> , in another building. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And when we got the notice duo paci, tre paci, etcetera, the only <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> we could not use ourself, but was used by the underground, was the <span class="INT_SPACE">fifth floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And we stay away from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">Well, we would get from the potinaya, from the concierge, this little note that there would be duo paci, tre paci, quattro paci, and we would have somebody staying all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And these were like -- for example, this girl, I don’t remember her name, except then she was lame. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I can’t remember her name now. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">She died of TB later, after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">But there was a whole group of children, of friends, women, old men, and everybody took turn, but then it was us who were familiar with the <span class="DLF">border</span> , who had to take the person to the next step. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">And for me, it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aljanio</span> , or 1t was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Como</span> , and not just for me, but for all the friends in the group of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="984">These would be mountain loving people that young -- young girl, like all that group then, is gone now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="985">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">You know what I thought we would do? </span><span class="sentence" id="987">Maybe we’d look at the map, and you would - you can trace it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="988">ANSWER:  All right.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  Okay, we’re going to stop now. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ginetta Sagan, conducted by Joan Ringleheim, on September 24"", 1999, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atherton</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="995">This is tape number four, side A. Ginetta, you wanted to speak about a sort of double person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="996">ANSWER:  Well, one of the difficulty we had in the underground was that we always had to be careful about infiltrator into our group of assistance to the prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">And we have to remember that we assisted family and prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">There were people who were working, helping the war effort, for the allies, for the Committee of National Liberation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , and elsewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="999"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Torino</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valdosta</span> , val -- everyplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">And one of the difficulty we had was when a person was taken, the interrogation in depth, which meant torture, led to picking up other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">And I would never blame anyone for speaking under torture, because it’s unbelievable the horror than they can perpetrate on human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">One of the places in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> where the prisoner were taken was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Vittory</span> , and there was a special section which was controlled by the SS, and the moti. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">The SS had control of the prisoner brought there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Usually their major interest was 1n information, people who are work -- working to gather information useful to the allies in the war effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">One of the key people in that accession of the SS, was named Hugo Osteria. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">Hugo Osteria had been a policeman -- political policeman for the Ovra, the secret police of Mussolini, or the Fascists, throughout that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And when, after September eight, the -- he began working for the SS, and the Gestapo in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Vittory</span> , in the section specialized in -- in interrogation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">Besides Hugo Osteria, there was a -- a man, whose name was Franz, and he had huge dogs that he didn’t mind unleashing on the prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">And another, Sawecki, something like that, s -- li -- Sawecki -- s -- I can’t remember the spelling, Sawecki. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">He was an SS captain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">Hugo Osteria was the interpreter for the SS, for the Gestapo in that particular <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">So, he approached the committee of National Liberation, and said, “I want to help you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">So he would give us the name of the people detained in the particular <span class="REGION">area</span> if he could, and also to let us know what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">Needless to say, we had other sources, mostly the suarai, the nun, the doctor, being careful, but was one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">The baker was another one who was very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And -- but Hugo Osteria became important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">So, what he did was sometime he let people be tortured, deported to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">Among them was Jainjo Bamphi, the brother of Senator Arialdo Bamphi, a-and the husband of Mrs. Bamphi, whom I met, and she described that it was Hugo Osteria who arrested Jainjo Bamphi in their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">So Julianna -- Julia Bamphi told me he played the double game, because he helps them, and he help usually important people, of the Committee of National Liberation, like Ferucho Parai, then later on, at the end of the war, would testify on his behalf. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">But many other people, like Jako Perdenti, Cheenira Scapolla, and Jainjo Bamphi were not only tortured, but then deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , where they died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And this was typical of this man, and other working for the Nazi and the Fascist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">Then they would give the Committee of National Liberation, and the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , information about certain prisoner, or arrange for money to be paid to somebody by some family desperate to get help for their prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">But essentially, you never knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">Certainly she never trusted them, and eventually the allies decided that this man was so unreliable that he had to be shipped in the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And Bustelli told me how he -- he was a S-Swiss Intelligent Services, how he, personally felt for a long time than this man was a prototype of politsiato, political politsiato, never to be trusted, that he would give some help when it was possibly beneficial for him in the future, in the political settlement after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">But helped to arrest people, did a lot of damage, used informer, and unfortunately, because of the double game, managed to gain the trust of some people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> , which led to disastrous results. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1028">QUESTION:  I’m taking a break. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">We’re back from our break.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1030">ANSWER:  But you can understand why I just don’t want to [inaudible]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">I wanted Hugo Osteria to be known as a skunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">But we have also cristori, police chief, who were asked to keep their job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">It was very important than they stayed where they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">They had access to curfew paper, so that people could say, I’m a doctor, I’m a nurse, I need to travel after the curfew is implemented, and were very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">One of the first thing when the Committee of National Liberation did was to have false identity card made for various people, Jewish, Catholic, the people working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> , and -- so, there was this man, whose name was Joe Bacigalupi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">I don’t know where he came from, except that he was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">Joe Bacigalupi work with the Committee of National Liberation, and he was a genius. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">What he did, according to my friend in the Resistance movement, and I was the beneficiary of his work for our people, what he did was to say to the cristori, “Look, this was is going to be won by the allies, not by the Fascists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">If you help us, we will help you, and many other people.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">Now, I don’t know why they- he needed help, I have no idea, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">What they asked him to do was to -- the underground asked him to ask the cristori for a list of the best forgerer, who had been either in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , or were in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> because of forgery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">So Joe Bacigalupi became the number one specialist in doing forged document. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">And was an enormous help, because we helped, working as cleaning people, cleaning floor, <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">cleaning floor</span> , latrine, and other, for the Fascist, and for the German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">And because you are a cleaner, doing meaning job, they don’t consider you a person who has hear, and -- you know, all what they knew was that we were cleaner, perfect beggar, peasant, and -- and they would talk quite freely around people, because they didn’t think that we wa -- but among all, was to steal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">To steal some blank -- blank paper which were the koolfer -- call curfew for the lushapasari. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">And that was very important, because --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  What 1 -- what is luss --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Lushapasari means those papers, official paper that allowed people to travel after curfew was implemented. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">But then it happen -- Joe Bacigalupi, and the team of forgerer, when they had this, then it was their job to duplicate, raticate, etcetera, and make it available, and there was some for the doctor, some for the people of assistance, and many -- false, of course, but the German caught on of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">So every once in awhile, every two or three months, and they would change the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">So here we go, the cleaning lady, the cleaning ti -- di -- or boys, or whatever, and -- and we had to take some more, or sometime we worked as cleaning lady from some Fascist and onners, and get some more, but Joe Bacigalupi, and with the cooperation of the cristori, the policeman, whoever, he managed to get the list of all the forgerer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">He was best forgerer in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , and for other paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">We were told at that time, that the allied in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> had botched a job of duplicating false paper, which caused immediately the arrest of the two people who were carrying this false paper into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , so Joe Bacigalupi said, “Damn it, how stupid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">Those allies my have much money and all that, but they don’t know how to do things.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">And he was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">Eventually he was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">Eventually, with the help of the inside guard, a key was left unattended, so that he could walk out at lunchtime when everybody was busy eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">So this is some of my recollection. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">And then of course, his paper were very important for people to bring to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and all people were sent from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">But then, in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> too, we had a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">On one point, an infiltrator, I believe his name was Cherasa, but I’m not certain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">I believe so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">He managed to go into one of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> for Italian military, where he learned about plans by the allies, and -- to get people out, and he managed to get out and report to the -- San Vittory, to Hugo, and to the other group, what this Italian prisoner in the Swiss camp were planning, how they were selecting specialists, be the kind of job then that Aurora did in bringing back into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> these people to help in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> , cause the ally needed help with specialists in demolition, for <span class="DLF">railway</span> , for <span class="DLF">bridges</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swiss camp</span> were planning, how they were selecting specialists, be the kind of job then that Aurora did in bringing back into Italy these people to help in the underground, cause the ally needed help with specialists in demolition, for railway, for bridges, and so some Italian were very happy to get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and help the allies to -- to do these kind of jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">So you needed people to be very careful in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> because of infiltrator, like this Cherasa, who they managed to get out, and go to report to Hugo, and to these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And you needed specialists in demolition, se -- others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">But the reason I think about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aurora</span> was that here was a young woman in her 20, who gave her life to help.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1066">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1067">ANSWER:  So, in a small way, we have tried to honor her, as well as the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">This is it.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1134">ANSWER:  -- while the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> were sheltering the people to be passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">So Lydia was organizing the dinners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And at first the Austrian were very easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">Then, the German realized that -- what was happening, and instead of sending all the -- <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and they began sending SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">And true, they were SS who may have been f -- wounded on other <span class="NPIP">fronts</span> , but they were SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">And then they began to patrol with the dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And then it became more and more difficult, but we had the help of Bustelli and all the Swiss. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">Bustelli realized that his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> had been infiltrated, it was somebody, ba -- so he began talking to the -- not only to Lydia, but all to the smuggler in the dialect of the Teecheeno, which is incomprehensible to many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">And the day Leonard and I visited him, he -- he wrote a poem which I have in dialect, in my file. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">But he ro -- the whole <span class="REGION">area</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> , the smuggler, the farmer, the pe -- everybody was --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  It was hilar --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  -- helping, and on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , there were the Swiss. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">So I am aware then the Swiss kept money from the Jewish people, but I want to thank the Swiss people, who helped so much, not only with the border crossing, but also in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> <span class="DLF">border crossing</span> , but also in the camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">I mean, there were some good people, and they deserve recognition for their courage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">Now the dogs became a problem, and I want to mention what Lydia said, pass the words that we had to carry precious little ground meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">Inside there was a pill for the dogs, and above all, not to show fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">Lie down, pretend to sleep, leave the meat available right next to you, and as soon as the dog gulps that down, then the dog goes to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">Again, these are thing that we had no idea, but she and the network working with her, and the network with erking in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , all together, taught us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">We were really greens on this matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">But the farmer, and the Pastore deser -- an-and then there was the guardida finansa, who were the Italian treasuries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">Some of them remained faithful to Fascist, but few of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">The others all helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">So that when passages had to be done, organized by a, the network of the smart lerrer, and both Lydia from the Italian point, and Bustelli from the Swiss point, but there were a thousand of people working in the whole network. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">Then, it was very important in the guardida finansa, the Italian one, would turn their back so that we could do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">One of our job was to patch the <span class="DLF">holes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">Now, the arrangement for passing between Bustelli, and Lydia, and their network, because obviously, was big network, was done by arrangement with special bell put on the collar of the goats. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And the signal of the bell suggested the place of passing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">It was an organization, but the -- of course, we have to remember, the smuggler have been there for thousand of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">After the war, they became <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> owner, bar owner, and we had the joy of meeting, my husband and I, and my son, actually, as well, and dot -- and granddaughter, we went to meet one of them in the Easala comatchina, on the Lake of Como, where there is a marvelous <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake of Como</span> , where there is a marvelous restaurant, and is run by s -- former smuggler, and their children, and their sa -- children now of course in their 40 and 50. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">So it’s really an homage to ordinary people once again, but this woman deserve special recognition for --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  You mean Lydia.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1162">ANSWER:  Lydia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">She -- I believe she never went beyond the third grade, but her capacity for organizing was incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">Also her courage, and there are stories that we don’t have time to go into it, but one brief one was that on one occasion, a man than she taught was with us, sent by the Committee of National Liberation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">Turned out that he -- she helped him to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">From there he learned a great deal, then he -- and then he came back and started her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and she realized that he was a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">At this point, two partisan came at her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , with guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">And this man, of course, also could do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">And Lydia said to the two partisan, “Please, please, I have two small daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">If you kill him, then the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> will be burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">Everything will be burned, and we will lose everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">So please go away, go away.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">So this Nazi man took Lydia to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , probably to the SS, she doesn’t know where they took her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">They sat her in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where they gave her a big meal, and she thought this was her last supper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">Then somebody came, took her by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ronaggo</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , gave her a note. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">Inside there was two gold coins, one for each of her daughter, and a little note. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1178">You saved my life, I am now saved yours. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">But there will be no next time.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">So Lydia was so terrified by this experience, that she went to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the Swiss side of a friend and very active member of the underground, and she went to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">And when she woke up -- these man had the penchant for putting mask with colored lights all over around the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">So when she woke up, she saw all these mask with all these lights, and she screamed, “Ayuto, ayuto, ayuto.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">And -- and all of a sudden, a -- several young men in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trunk</span> , because it was hot, arrived, beautiful young men who were waiting to pass through the Italian-Swiss border, to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> <span class="DLF">-Swiss border</span> , to come to Italy to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And she said to me, “Well, when I saw all those beautiful young men, I thought, if this is <span class="NPIP">hell</span> ,’ because she thought she was in <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , ayuto, “if this is <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , I will stay.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1185">QUESTION:  And what is -- what is ayuto?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1186">ANSWER:  Ayuto means help, help.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1187">QUESTION:  Aha.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1188">ANSWER:  So Shirley Dondréa came with me, and we went with -- you know, with Lydia, we saw this beautiful <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">The owner was working with the underground, but he was also a major entrepreneur, traffic dinart, the Swiss knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">But when he died, he left everything to Lydia, and- because she helped, saved his life many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">But anyway, this Shirley and I -- I think Shirley took a -- pictures of this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with all the mask, with the colored light, and so we had a jolly good laugh at that time, and realized that the war was really over, we could talk about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1192">QUESTION:  Did you see Lydia much during the -- during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1193">ANSWER:  Oh -- oh no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1194">QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1195">ANSWER:  No, far from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">We knew about the famous Lydia, but -- she did other things that are incredible, such as she dressed like a bride, with a man dressed like a groom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> they retrieved very precious material which was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">And dressed like a bride and a groom, they crossed the <span class="DLF">borders</span> , raising her sk-skirt flirtatiously with the German border, and then as soon as they arrived, then she has a -- a str -- tremendous number of people who came out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> to help unload the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> <span class="DLF">German border</span> , and then as soon as they arrived, then she has a -- a str -- tremendous number of people who came out of the woods to help unload the truck, because it cor -- contained precious material than the Swiss could not get. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">And so Bustelli commissioned her to organize from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , loaded with this precious material, dressed like a bride, cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> with a groom, and then as soon as they were on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , say this band of bandits -- I mean no, they were -- came out, and apparently, from what I learned from others, she had a stick and ran and said, “Faster, faster, faster, get it out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">Because they were afraid then the German would realize the trick, and go after them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">But this is Lydia for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">You saw her picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">No, then she thought that I was dead, or --</p>

class="sentence" id="1303">The <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in good faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">Tito, or ever, who is the commander of the Valtoonage did not go personally, as he was asked to do, but send somebody, because he sensed -- he smelled somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">So there was this frantic call, or communication from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valdosta</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , to the Committee of National Liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">The information had come from -- I was told, from somebody who went to a beauty parlor from our side, who heard either a Fascist or a Nazi woman, or mistress, or somebody saying, “Oh yeah, they are negotiating with the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> <span class="BUILDING">beauty parlor</span> from our side, who heard either a Fascist or a Nazi woman, or mistress, or somebody saying, “Oh yeah, they are negotiating with the church, but they are going to clean up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">The German are already started.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">Something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">So, immediately, there was this one page, frantic communication to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valdosta</span> , it was too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">We lost a lot of people, it was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">Many people were killed, and there was a traitor who was working right next to Tito. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">And when the time came for this person to go and give the meecha, the fire to the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , so then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> couldn’t go, he killed the other person with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">So -- and he had been with -- with us for three months and nobody realized that he was a double. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">But this I confirmed with Monsieur Tiba, when I saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">And I spoke to Tito a few years ago about all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">So, after this disaster, we lost a lot of people, including young people that we had send up, because they didn’t want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , they wanted to participate in the active Resistance movement, so we send them up to the banns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">And among them a young man, Hoos Franco from either <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maltarra</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pavia</span> , very close by, but actually, we were involved, our group was involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">Soon after all this disaster occurred, I was told by a friend, member of our group, the Benedetti, who was a mountain climber, and his son was working with us, he wife was working with us, that it was very important to go up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valtoonage</span> , and assess the damage, but more importantly, it was very important to go to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of pierovono, one of the guide, one of the Alpinist, and only since last dega -- August, I knew -- I learned that he was part of this special group, like Lashincross, I didn’t know before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">As far as we knew, we were all in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> , working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">And these gentlemen, these architect, would come and pick me up at -- sometime early in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">He had all the permit, and he had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , he owned a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chervinia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">His name was architect Molino. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">Never met him in my life, but I was supposed to be his mistress. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">And, “But he’s a gentleman, Ginetta, you don’t have to worry, but we need somebody to go up with him, he own a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and he has a perfect reason to see if damage was done, to fix it for the winter, and he has his mistress with him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">And the mistress was me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">And so jus -- lo and behold, here, in November come this gentleman, and kiss my hand, and I go with him, he had all the passes, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">And we arrived, traveling to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shationne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1328"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shationne</span> is right at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the <span class="DLF">Valtoonage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">And we stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">He was going to place his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> someplace in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shantionne</span> , and we had to carry the knapsack. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">I ask my ri -- I ask him if I could take a little suitcase, he said, “Yeah, if you feel like carrying that plus your knapsack, go ahead,” but, you know, I didn’t bring, I put everything in the knapsack. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">But we had to bring up some medicine, and we arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shantionne</span> , we go to this little bric and brac little <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">This wonderful woman, Delphina was her name, and we chatted amiably, and then this architect said to me, “Go ahead, because I will catch up with you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">Remember, I was in my teen, and he was probably 60, but he was much stronger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">So it was obvious that he -- well, I didn’t think much, but 1t was obvious that he wanted to talk to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">Only in retrospect I figured all that out, but I didn’t at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">And we went, and we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valtoomage</span> , and -- at the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of this family, and it was a -- all of the women were in black, they were -- well, they broke down crying, because of the horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">And one of them described to me how Franco died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">They killed several people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">In fact, about 10 years ago, I took a picture of the monument to those people, and we went, and then I realized that we -- we wanted to stay in val -- I wanted to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valtoomage</span> , and he, no, no, we have to go ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chervinia</span> , and at the <span class="DLF">passage</span> , at the <span class="DLF">block passage</span> , there was Italian young Fascist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">Very energetic, very ideologically committed people, but he had passes, and they were passes from the Gestapo, the SS, or some authority, and immediately everybody was, oh, please let me help you, blah, blah, blah, and all kind, and -- and I thought, oh my God, you know, I -- I trust Benedetti, no -- no -- but at the same time, you are startled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">I never met this person, but he was kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">We arrived at his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I was so tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">He helped me to take off my shoes, made a fire, and gave me something to drink, and -- and then I lied down and I slept for awhile, and then he woke me up, and he said, “We have to go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">And we went to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">house</span> owned by Pierovona in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">And we ha -- w-we had to retrieve some material, which we did, and I had to put them in my chest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">Then, next day -- then I went back to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> -- next day, I s -- had to say to the Fascist that were mocking me for being with such an old man, etcetera, etcetera, that the altitude was not good for me, I had to go back, and say, “Oh yeah, this old man is no good, but we are good, come with us,” blah, blah, blah all that suns -- kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">But they were very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">And I was going to walk down, but then they drove me down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">And at the val -- at the end, th -- at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shationne</span> , there was a little <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where I was supposed to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">When the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> keeper saw me arrive with this Fascist, he was as cold as one can be, he said he -- yes, he had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , but no food, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">So, well, I went to -- to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , and about one or two in the morning, there were shots fired in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , the glass fu -- so I went under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">Until the day before, the -- somebody from the Fascist or the Nazi used this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">So the partisan thought then they were still there, but I was there, so I went under the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">And about oh, few minutes later, some partisan came in with the red ankle chafe, and the machine gun is -- “Where is she, where 1s she? </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">Oh my God, what we have done?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">They knew, they learned that I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">So, the face of <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> keeper changed completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">He b -- the partisan actually, they said, libber, please give her some -- anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">So he brought out cheese and wine and bread, and -- and apologized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">And then he put some coal in a scarbaletto. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">Is a gadget with a long handle, and inside put the coals, so that his wife warmed up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">I mean, it was such a change. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">And we -- next morning, I came down and he gave me -- I realized he put something in my knapsack which was very good, cheese and a piece of meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">I arrived <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> up above was where those two friends, and it was clear that something had happened, the food was left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">And so I quickly got out, as well as bring the material to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Viabeeli</span> , and I was told then they were caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">So I began working with Dom Bickuli. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">And this Pierro, that I still don’t know, who was an elegant man, working with the cardinal, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">And the idea came, then I had to go and try to find hostages for exchange. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">That’s little <span class="DLF">field</span> that I have, 1s one example. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">And the son of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Corvul</span> sent me, because he knew then I had -- we were doing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">And I went north, all the way to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to another <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> , up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borneo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1374"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borneo Livino</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">From Banktband with a password at each <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and -- and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Livino</span> , I was told than [indecipherable] for exchange with our friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">Well, that was February, beginning of February. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , because I couldn’t walk any more, my feet were so swollen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">And I arrived in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tiranno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tiranno</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> was surrounded, and -- and so that’s how I was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">And from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tiranno</span> few days later, that was the brigatanari, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sondrio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">And to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sondrio</span> , a very important story, because I saw someone died, and all sorts of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">And then I was really -- I brought <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> to the mouti, and I was told by a man whose name was Crome that I didn’t speak, but they had the means to make me speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">I didn’t doubt it, but I -- but then they released me because somebody said then, oh no, no, I was not involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">Two hours -- I was still black and blue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">Two hours later, one of the people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sondrio</span> , who had accompanied me to the bi -- mouti in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">And he said, “You are not working, so you have to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sondrio</span> to work for us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">And I said, “Well, I have an appointment with my doctor, because I have some problem with my lungs.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">And, “Well, you go and see your doctor and then you come back with us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">So I went to the doctor, who was one of us, and the doctor meanwhile, had arranged for my friend, Enrico Mullisanno to arrive, and they said, “If you have the courage to do it, we would like you to -- to do it, to go back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">Well, once they arrived back, it was clear that it was a ruse, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">And it was -- it’s a long story, but the women of the Black Brigade were as bad as the men, and all of us remaining -- one was Bruno Bianci, whom I saw, and his wife was killed, the order came from Mussolini headquarter, from -- that all the people who may have been involved in Intelligence gathering -- and evidently they sus -- suspected that I was -- actually turnous, probably they were right, but I -- I didn’t know -- they should be executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">And what they did was to make a sign that you were there voluntarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">They received a tremendous amount of brand new money from someplace, and they made a sign than they had given us all this money, when it was in fact they kept it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">And they wanted to interrogate me once again, which was, you know, it was the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">But there was something really cruel about -- not all of them, at the point they were ready to be bad, but not all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">Still holding on to this -- what they were talk about? </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">The special weapon that the German would use, and would win the war after all, except after April thir -- 23. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">And they were talking about them, and I was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">They didn’t want to leave witnesses to what they had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">It was very important that I give the name of all our people, it was -- so, they were trying once again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">When the telephone rung, and somebody said than the German wanted to talk to me again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">Well, everything was falling apart, but still they couldn’t get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">And they were very angry that they didn’t dare to say no to the German, they still had an inferiority complex vis a vis of the German, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">That’s my personal impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">And -- and two people dressed in German uniform came in, and made jokes about these Italian sissy, that they fall down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and f -- you -- you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">So the Italian dragged me up, but the German hold -- held me, and they took me out to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">And from there they took me to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where the nun received me and helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">But I only learned later there were a number of people involved, not only for me, but for others, and German deserter was -- were asked to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">To intercept the communication in case the brigatanari, the mouti, would check to see whether it was true, that you still -- no, they didn’t trust anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">And so these people were risking their lives to -- to help us, to -- to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">And it was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bustelli</span> , and -- and Lydia that they were part of the organizing with the help, with the guardiri publicani. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">The guardiri publicani were Italian who were called to serve. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">If they didn’t, their father, their mother, would be beaten up, so they served, but they were our allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">So there was a number of people involved in rescuing last minute people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">interrogation cells</span> , because they knew that we would all be executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">And so, for a couple of days, in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , oh everything, you know, little broth, wonderful care. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">And -- but for two days, I was hidden, and then one of the people from the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> in that <span class="REGION">area</span> -- that’s another story, it’s too complicated, but apparently I saved his life, and, “Torpelino, Torpelino,” and then he came, and - so then they brought me upstair and I was in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">I was ca -- I had been cleaned up, and I was being treated, and I had wonderful care. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">And then, I have to say, the Italian government did something that every government today should do for the people who are caught in such circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">They took care of all the care, and I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sondolo</span> , it is a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , used to be for TB only, but we were rec -- put there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">And then, from there f -- until September, and then to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> called San Martino di Castrotsa, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , for winter, and -- and then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baratsai</span> , f -- at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> for a few months of treatment, and then I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and- and --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Ginetta, see -- you were captured in February?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1421">ANSWER:  February, 1945, beginning of February.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1422">QUESTION:  February, 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1423">ANSWER:  And helped to get out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Apri</span> -- on April 23", 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1424">QUESTION:  So when they were torturing you, was this consistent, every day, was it -- w-was it --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, not every day, but they would do -- not only to me -- and remember, I was just one of other people Bianchi. [</span><span class="sentence" id="1425">indecipherable] time they took turn, first him, then me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">They had a hand generator for electricity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">And I get upset when some people say, well we have to stop armament, because that only will stop torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">That’s ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">Torture can be applied in any small unity, by any means, by anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">And -- and I think by doing the -- the other, you divert the attention from the reality, that any lethal piddling group, can find a way and means to torture people, including in the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">And -- but these were sophisticated matord, and many people didn’t make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">Tiberio Pansini died under torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">And -- but also some people who were there, who tried to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">And you know, you could see in their eyes that -- and then of course, they did, they help you to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">And also put out the matchbox, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1436">QUESTION:  Yes, could you tell that st-story, when you got the matchbox?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1437">ANSWER:  Well, because one of the point of the SS, the Gestapo, and [indecipherable] other police, everywhere, the point is to make the prisoner believe, that no one knows where he or she 1s, nobody care, the -- you are 1n their hands, period. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">And there is a consistent effort to make the prisoner believe that you are in their hands, nobody knows where you are, nobody cares. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">And one night, one of the guard shouting really bad words for a woman, you know, kicked the <span class="DLF">door</span> open, and send this panino, that Italian bread, which is empty <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , you know, if you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , you’ll see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">And I pick it up, and it was dark, but I -- we left the <span class="DLF">door</span> open, but -- so I saw what it was, and -- and then I started eat, I was so hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">I was also afraid that there may be some poison inside. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">But there was a matchbox, a tiny cherino. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">They are called cherini, I’ve never seen one so small in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">They are cherini, and I lit it, and there was this little piece of paper, coracho. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">So I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">No matter how many time they told me that nobody knows where I was, and I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">But I think it was important because I -- psychologically you feel like giving up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">The other thing than they repeat to you day after day, that if you tell what happened to you to anybody, we will find you to the end of the earth, you will pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">And it seems to be a deliberate conditioning for the prisoner, because they did it on both <span class="NPIP">places</span> , in the tirano and the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">And a, nobody knows you are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">You are in our hand, we can do what we want, and b, if you tell anybody, you -- we’ll find you to the end of the earth, you know, tha -- so, and -- working with prisoner later on in <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> , and re -- same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">Former prisoner, former victim of torture would tell me time after time the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">And if it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> , or <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> , or <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> at that time, or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , or the soviet -- the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">So it -- it’s -- there is an institution which is not necessarily taught, but developed by each one, by -- in each <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">And I think most important thing is to educate the public everywhere, then there was a meaning to the universal declaration of human rights, to make sure that see will never happen again to the Jewish people, to the anti- Fascist, to the anti-Stalin, to everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">And so I am glad I survived all these years.</span></p>
