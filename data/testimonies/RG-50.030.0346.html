<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  It was beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">It was a vary large family. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My parents, sisters, and brothers -- I mean, my mother had about seven siblings. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And my father, the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And for instance, on Purim we're gathering all of us in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of my grandma. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And it was.....
QUESTION:  Stop tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">We have to do this again. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  Now, as an example, for instance, on Purim we were all gathering at my grandma's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">It was grandma Weingarten. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And it was extremely festive, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">On Purim, you bring schlackamonies. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So there were just beautiful cakes, and what they call torte, and there was fruit. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And everybody gathered there, all my cousins, and all my aunts and uncles. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And usually, it lasted -- there was one cousin who played the violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And that was Itzic (ph) Weingarten. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And then we -- it was very nice for us children because we had to stay up longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And then when we came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the manager of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> came out, and we have to ring the bell, and he opened the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And for us children, it was a big happening coming so late. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And he -- and it was Purim. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">But it must have been cold because he was coming out with a fur coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And it was a good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">We were to our grandma's we surely went by druzka, which was a horse -- horse-drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And there was always a lot of fun too. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">We met the cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">There were my aunts. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And in the summer, in the beginning, we used to go to a <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> , like Rainitza (ph), or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rapka</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And later on, we built a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portumbina</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And it was one -- there were, like, four <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And one was ours, and the other one we use to rent out. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">In fact, I have a picture in front of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">It was beautiful there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And we were spending the vacations there. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So life was pretty normal and very much based on family. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">It was called <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> imienia Hochsztajnowei. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And it was a lovely <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">It was so beautiful there. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">In our <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> was like a mirror. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And when we came to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we had to change shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And we often had concerts in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">We had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">grand piano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And there was often -- Chopin was often being played. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">When I hear Chopin now, I remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And my brother was going also to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And in the afternoon, he had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">parochial school</span> to learn more Hebrew and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And we used to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I remember we played <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I and him, in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> when our housekeeper put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> in the middle so that she could clean them. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And there were holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">There were beautiful occasions. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">There were summer outings. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">There were picnics. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And all of a sudden, like a lightening from the <span class="DLF">sky</span> actually, everything changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And, of course, we had no idea that anything like that could actually happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And so there were actually clouds in the <span class="DLF">sky</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">There was bunchen where the people from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But somehow, when you live a normal life, you just don't think and don't believe of such a possibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">My father did -- after the Germans entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , he predicted certain -- I mean, even before, he predicted certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And I asked him, "If that's what you believe, why aren't we leaving?". </span><span class="sentence" id="68">First, there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And then you have really to have guts and you have really -- to be able to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">But there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Nobody wanted us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Let me stop you a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Was your family fairly religious? </span><span class="sentence" id="74">You had mentioned Purim.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We actually celebrated all the holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And my father was rather religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">He was -- at the same time, he spoke French and he spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">He was a wizard in mathematics. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And, of course, we had a business. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">The business was on <span class="BUILDING">Ostrowska 10</span> and <span class="BUILDING">polizei station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And it was Golontaria Emenya Weingartenya (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And everybody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> knew that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And today, I sometimes meet people here even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> who said, "Of course, we were going there." </span><span class="sentence" id="85">We had a very good name. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Everybody was safe because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , at that time, you didn't have prices on any articles. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">But they knew you could send a check to that <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and they would be treated fairly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  What kind of <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  If somebody is familiar with the <span class="BUILDING">Silk Shop</span> , which used to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> , it was very similar. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">There were wools, and lace, and buttons, and gloves, and hats, and -- I mean, all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And it was in existence for a very long time, until the Germans took the keys away. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And so my father's family was more religious than my mother's family. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">But we celebrated all the holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And our Passover was just fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">It was so beautiful and -- it was so beautiful, I remember that we -- I used fall asleep finally, because it lasted so long. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">But all the -- it was just beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  Did you --
ANSWER:  You asked me about the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , sorry if I interrupt?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  Well, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I was wondering if you had any Christian friends or if you really lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  It's very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">The manager of the <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> was not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And in our <span class="BUILDING">summer house</span> , the keeper of the grounds was not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And some of the housekeepers at my grandma's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> were not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But, in generally, we were actually -- we thought that everybody was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  Large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  It was a very large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> was -- I understand there were 250,000 Jews or more. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">It was a textile in the <span class="DLF">street</span> there and it was called the Polish Mattress Stash. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And so when some of this -- of the big industrialists in textile were going to our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">It was Vininsky (ph), Korn (ph), and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Did you experience any anti-Semitism or you just weren't around it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Oh, we felt it. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Somehow we did feel it. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">We knew that it exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We felt it much more before -- after Hitler came into power and after the death of Marshall Pilsudski. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">That really felt 1t and I remember one program. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">summer house</span> all the father, I and Lolick (ph) and when we came back my mom was petrified, terrified standing at the <span class="DLF">window</span> because she had a feeling which I will always remember because she knew there is a program and -- but we were able to somehow safely reach our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And there was some times such a underlying fear of certain things which I as a child could sense and it had much to do with anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">That .... did that answer your question?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  Yes, and it, your question actually right now is how it was before the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="124">See, that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I was going to was a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> and I started the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> from the first grade and then I was maybe fortunate because I gained one year to graduate and they -- I had my papers graduation papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I thought they were very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Dave, my husband, saw them and when we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I thought it would be helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I put it in my stocking. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">But of course, it wasn't helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I could get a copy, I think, if I would write to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , but it's not -- not really important right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So it was -- it was actually a good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">It was a Jewish life. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We also had very high morals and ethics. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And I remember that when the Germans came and we had to wear the yellow star I was, nothing to it as I was concerned, but I had a friend, Genya Finkelstein (ph), who was from a little bit more assimilated <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she didn't want to go out I said, "Genya, they're doing it to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">They are the perpetrators. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Let them be ashamed. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Why should we be ashamed to wear the star?" </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And it had something to do with the upbringing I received in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we knew much about charity. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">My father used to always to say "It's not enough to give. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">It's important how you give." </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I know when there were some relatives not close relatives who needed help. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">There was always help ready for them and every Friday night my father was bringing from the <span class="BUILDING">House Of Prayers</span> a guest which is called the orrach, and he was sitting with us at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and when we finished the meal he was given a bag of food to take with him and nobody asked him any questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">It was a charitable atmosphere in our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">For instance, my grandmother one time somebody stole silver spoons and her daughter says, "Don't let htm in anymore." </span><span class="sentence" id="144">She says, "Look, if he wouldn't have needed the spoons, he wouldn't have taken them." </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So considering the high ethics and high morals it was inconceivable for us to think that such atrocities which followed later on are possible that we had to prepare ourselves, but there was no way to prepare ourselves anyhow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  One more question about before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Were you involved in any political or Zionist organizations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  I knew of their existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I knew of their existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">However, in -- in retrospect I know that it was -- actually the right thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Because if you have an idea, no matter how impossible it seems at the certain time what should actually follow it? </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Because the first there is an idea always and there are deeds following it. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But because of the background and because of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I was not involved in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I remember a certain time somebody wanted to -- to -- me to join, but I didn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  What do you remember about the day when the Germans came in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  Yeah, it was a very, very frightening thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">They put up some --
QUESTION:  What was the, I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">What was the date, do you remember’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  It was in 1939 and it must have been already in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And some gallows were put on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and some Jewish men were hung and they were very much interested that as many as possible people would see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">When they entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> they somehow wanted to harass and abuse the Jewish men, so there were, let's say, a knock in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they wanted my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">People who were taken to so called work were not taken actually to actual work. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Some people were, for instance, bringing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> up the set <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and the others were suppose to take it down and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">It was just shear harassment. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Shear torment. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Shear like they wanted to demoralize us and what was happening was my father was still going to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and I was afraid that he'll be picked up and harassed, so I was going with him and he called me his angel. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I had long brown hair and somehow I was very often able to talk the German out of letting him go. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I remember that one time we -- they brought us into a <span class="DLF">court yard</span> and they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And -- but it was a very frightening time because it was a very unsure time because -- and what was so tragic about it the Germans actually could not recognize who is a Jew and who is not, but there were Polish children standing on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and pointing out to the Germans who is Jewish and considering that they were just having been occupied by the Germans and why did they do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="170">You know, very often I'm thinking about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Where does all this, I mean, it's -- it's based on -- on the teaching unfortunately of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> which I hope is being changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">But in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> it will take a very, very long time until it would be changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I heard somebody saying that he got this feeling of a stygmatism with the milk of his mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Because -- and as I understand, that the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , the -- anyhow the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic Church</span> since Pope the 23rd, is realizing that the roots, a lot of the roots of this tragedy actually started with the people of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Because it can teach hatred and there have been changes in their liturgy and their changes are -- are going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I'm sure there are many, many Christians of very good heart and I'm glad that there is from the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> some directions now to change the liturgy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">We were talking about how the Polish people would -- would turn you in. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">What else was happening on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  It was especially -- for instance, 1t was so dangerous that my parents decided to send Lolick, my brother, to a smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where his closest friends were living. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">In the hope that he would be spared, but he came back after awhile because things were just as bad there. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">There was also much more difficult to get fuel. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Much more difficult to get food, SO we were living in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in order to save fuel. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">We could sometimes -- of course we couldn't get the amount of food which we needed, but we still could get some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">It was dangerous to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">It was dangerous to be in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because they were just coming in and pulling you out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  Were there any bombings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  The bombings were in the short period before the Germans came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">In fact, we went to a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">We -- you know, there were <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> where people were keeping the food to keep it cold and we were hiding there because there were some raids. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">That was in the period, the short period, before the German army actually entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  So how long did -- how long did this last? </span><span class="sentence" id="193">The Germans were in the -- the Germans came in, they were around all the time harassing people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  Yes, they were harassing people and one day when I brought my father to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> some Germans approached him and told him they wanted the keys to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">We just had to hand it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Now, we probably were expecting it and were bringing certain materials from the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and hiding it under the hardwood floors and we hid there also some Torahs. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Maybe I'll mention it later, but when we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> the manager, we assume, or we actually know that the manager of that <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> informed the German about it and my brother was taken to the <span class="BUILDING">Kripo</span> and from the <span class="BUILDING">Kripo</span> he had to go to our <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> and to -- to show them where everything is and they removed everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And it was -- you know, it was a very -- it was a very dangerous, dangerous time because there were shootings. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">There were shootings at that time and this -- this constant harassment, you don't know whether a person would go out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> or even from his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he would come back alive because the torture was quite perverse.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">QUESTION:  So, did you stay in most of the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">ANSWER:  We must have stayed in, but they were also coming into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I remember one time when they came and we hid my father in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , but it didn't help. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We had to show them where he is and they pulled him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And he wasn't -- he was very spiritual and he was very learned, but he wasn't a strong man, a very strong man physically. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">But he actually survived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  Did the Germans promelgate a bunch of decrees? </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Were there new laws, things you had to do?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  Like what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  First they liquidated all our <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">We couldn't own any <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I'm sure there was a catch for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">The amount of food we could get was limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Of course, I couldn't -- the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Our <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">We had -- we had -- actually, the minute they came in we were prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">We were prisoners and as an example of it they were putting up gallows and, you know, hanging people. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And, our dignity was taken away -- I mean, it my -- the way I feel it, my dignity was never taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Not even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I never felt inferior to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">It could be with the teaching of -- the teaching atmosphere of my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> I felt that the ones who do the wrong they should be ashamed of my -- of themselves and when I heard somebody say that he felt inferior during this time it struck me actually because I -- I never felt inferior. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Never.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">QUESTION:  Did all these changes happen right away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  Right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Right away, but the taking out of the -- I mean, the -- asking for the keys of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> because I remember I was still taking my father to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> for a short time and before he had to hand over the keys.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="232">QUESTION:  Did your family have any plans or you were just going to....
ANSWER:  There was no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">There was absolutely no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">You live a normal life and something which is beyond your many imagination happens you cannot prepare for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">There was no way to prepare there were some very very rich people who were somehow able to -- to reach a different <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">However, even the people of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who would have left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Even -- even a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was -- a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was sent aware form the shores of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">The white paper was issued and there was no <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Otherwise, some people could have maybe reached <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">No other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> would have opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , so, I mean, we were just boxed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Completely boxed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And, so some people did leave to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , for <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And a friend of my -- the closest friend of my brother left for <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and survived, and he asked, he came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and asked my father's permission that Lolick should go too. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And I do understand my father on -- on -- in a way because he said we all should stay together. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Nobody could have predicted what would happen and he said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And Lolick was an extremely -- first he was absolutely gorgeous. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">He was so handsome that when he was helping out sometimes in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> people would say "Go to that <span class="BUILDING">store</span> just to take a look at that guy because he's so handsome." </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Then he was extremely talented. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">As a child he was curious how the grandfather's clock is working. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">So he took it apart and when he couldn't put it together he used a string, but the clock was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I mean, by losing him, of course I lost a brother, but the world lost something too. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And when we considered all these people who were burned, gassed, tortured, murdered, the world lost something too because they were scientists and they were future doctors and they were future physicists and they were just people who learned from childhood, charity. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And that you are not living only for yourself, but you're living only for others.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">QUESTION:  At what point did the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> come about?</span></p>

QUESTION:  What did you find -- I mean, how did that happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">There were announcements that we better go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or else they'd be shooting us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">QUESTION:  When was this do you remember’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">ANSWER:  That was in 19 -- 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">It was maybe six months after the Germans entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I guess when we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> it must have been somehow the beginning of April and they -- so we just had to go because otherwise, we would have been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And fortunately there was a neighbor of our's who was very helpful because she said she had some kind of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and why don't we go with her? </span><span class="sentence" id="264">So we packed some belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Not much of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">It was very very traumatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I was a pretty pampered child. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I wasn't a child anymore, I was 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">But I was pretty pampered and I couldn't take it so I kept fainting and there was no, there were only lavoratory -- there was no, you know, accomadations for <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And I remember we stayed there and then Ciotka [aunt] Hannah (ph) came and Uncle Moshe (ph) came and we all were sleeping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and then some how somebody told us about the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> of the Fresetska (ph) eight. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I think 1t was the same neighbor and that was one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">We lived in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and that was my father, my mother, my brother, myself and later on during one deportation there was also Ottos. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Ottos --
QUESTION:  You know, I'm -- What had you decided to take with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">ANSWER:  The time was very limited.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">QUESTION:  When you went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  Yes, and the amount of things we could take on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> was also very limited and, of course, we didn't have anybody ecspecially to help us, but anyhow I remember when the -- I remember that we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And I remember that we had one piece of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> which must have come from our <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">We had also a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> wasn't very large and what -- when ever I think about that <span class="NPIP">place</span> on Fresetska eight, who wasn't -- which wasn't very big and was the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and everything was in this one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , I have to give an enormous credit to my wonderful mother because it was extremely clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Always, extremely clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We're cooking there and sometimes I think about it, how was she able to keep this <span class="NPIP">place</span> such meticulously clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And later on after one deportation Ottos, our cousin, was adopted by us. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I think it had to be done so that they have his name in the register so, that's why he was really adopted. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And he came to us with a skin disease and my mother bathed him and cured him and my father got infected and she bathed my father, and she cured him. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And my mother was absolutely a very remarkable women. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">She was very beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">She found a job for herself, by herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">She was doing some -- some working with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">She cooked where ever there was some food to cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">She keeped everything clean and I know that at a certain time she was going to sick people and she was washing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">She was washing their bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And thats why the tragedy of -- when ever the tragedy was touching my mother she never complained, but it was very very painful to me and -- if I think about the time we were taken to the <span class="BUILDING">Kripo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292"><span class="BUILDING">Kripo</span> was the Kriminal Polizei. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">They were actually having a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and since we were considered well to do in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I mean, before -- they assumed that we had some valuables which they wanted to have. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Now first 1t was only my father who was being taken to the <span class="BUILDING">Kripo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">We were just petrified of the thoughts that they were going to take him and whether he would come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Many people didn't come back from the <span class="BUILDING">Kripo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">The Jewish authorities were notified to take the corpse away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kripo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">My father never disclosed anything and the strength his -- his spiritual and strength to be able to take the -- because they were actually whipping and hurting him and he came back and he didn't disclose anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">One time, they took my mother and I remember exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I was standing there when they took her and fortunately they came later on for me because I was very much afraid about her not that that I could do any help. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I remember I walked into the <span class="BUILDING">Kripo</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> , in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> , there were the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">torture chair</span> -- there were the <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> , where we were kept and in the back were the <span class="INT_SPACE">torture chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So when you were sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> you could hear cries and screams. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And -- but when I walked in there and this head of the Kripo, I think his name was Stutar (ph), was standing there and I laughed. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I was laughing in his face and he says "Das Lachen wird dir hier vergehen," which means "The laughter will stop here. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Your laughter will stop here." </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And I was also taken to the -- to the <span class="INT_SPACE">chambers</span> and I was also tortured, but not to a degree that, you know, that I had to be hospitalized or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And finally, I don't know how it happened that they were -- released us. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">It -- the whole time we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , there was always an enormous fear that we would go to the <span class="BUILDING">Kripo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And I remember when my father was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kripo</span> , when I was very concerned that he is not coming back, and he is not coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I went to his brother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">The brother was already deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">But his two sons -- one son was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And the son was very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">He was the one who was playing the violin so beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And he was a real genius. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And he says he was very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">He said to me, "Look. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">It's Friday night, and we didn't light the candles yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">So until we light the candles, he might still come back." </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I just remember what he was saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we tried to remember when it's Friday. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And on certain holidays, we made some -- mother prepared something from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> , or from the leaves, or something which was appropriate for that particular holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Now, you want to ask me something?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="324">QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Now, the problems in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were hunger, lack of fuel. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">But the worse of the worse was, the constant, deportations. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And you could never be sure that, what is not being deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And -- but there was one deportation, in particular, which was done by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">The other deportations -- when they hit somebody, of course, it was very tragic. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">So we really did not know for sure what was happening to us, and nobody thought that we were going to <span class="NPIP">places</span> that they would gas us in some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">In the beginning, they are telling us, they are taking people to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And there was a small number of people who were deported from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for the purpose of working in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , or in the <span class="REGION">territories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">In fact, one of my cousin, who was pretty husky, came back one time from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">But they took him -- after a very short time, they took him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I don't know whether to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Very likely, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">But it was torturous work. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So we did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">We actually had no inkling that a deportation means being taken to death, or gassed, or murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And this Germans were master of deceit. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Before they -- the deportation to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">loudspeakers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And I don't know who, in particular, it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">But 1t was people. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And they were assuring us that we should take everything we possibly can with us, because we are going to a better <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And I remember that my brother was working very hard to pack everything possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">They say, "Take pots and take pans, because you are going to a better <span class="NPIP">place</span> " -- and I was sick already at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">So I was just watching them. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">But they were packing. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Now, the deportation -- going back to the deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">There were always deportations. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">There was a list made, which in view of what happened -- this was, I think, '42, September -- the alternative -- the other alternative was very -- was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">They just -- I am -- they just came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , they ordered a gehsperren, which means, you know, a curfew -- they ordered a curfew and they said that they would take all elderly people, they would take children, and take -- we are -- if anybody would hide in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , they would be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">What I did -- I knew -- my mother was actually in her 40s. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">But she already had gray hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And I was very much afraid for her, that they would take her. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I don't know how I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">But I took her to the part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> which they already were searching and taking people away, and I hid her there. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">But I had to run back because there had to be a certain amount of people present in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> for them to do the selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And then I went back and brought her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Now, that was a terrifying time, because they were shooting anybody who, let's say, approached a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , or run to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that they didn't want to, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">They were all shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">They were just shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">They were taking some people who were younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">They did not really select only the older, the elderly, ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">It was one of the most traumatic, terrifying deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So there's no excuse for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">However, maybe because none of my family was deported -- so I'll tell you in a few minutes about my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">In comparison with the alternative, the alternative would have been -- I'm talking about the list -- the alternative would have been that they would enter the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and just shoot whomever they wanted and drag whomever, which was of course much more frightening to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And we didn't know and no one knew that we are going, just like we didn't know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , which I am very surprised that the Poles or somebody from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> would not somehow give us, because they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">They knew where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was, and they knew what was going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Anyhow, one time, my brother was about to be deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">What happened -- my mother was at her sister's, and I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and that Sonderkommando came, and they looked for him that he was supposed to be deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And he hid. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">But we had to, we had to, he had to come out of the hiding, and they took him. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And I had only one solution. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">See, he was very sick in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">He was sick with typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And he was -- that was a very terrible experience, because he was very sick and his eyes were not completely closed, only partial. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And finally, 1t was so hard on me to look at it that I was sleeping at a neighbor's and, in the morning, I was going to the <span class="DLF">window</span> -- we had the shutters closed -- and looking through the shutters whether he 1s still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And my mother, did everything possible -- we got some food for him -- she washed him, she bathed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And a neighbor told us of a doctor who was a heart specialist, Doctor Yorkiche (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And Doctor Yorkiche found that his myocardium, which is a sac around the heart, is infected. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And everybody suspected its typhus also. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">But if it would be -- if they would have taken him to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> -- of contagious diseases -- you would have never come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Nobody came out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And -- but -- so he was finally taken to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , a regular <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And fortunately, this was not at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Because later on, the German took all the patients from all the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , including the <span class="BUILDING">children's hospital</span> , and deported them. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">But that was earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">He reported that he was going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">But I knew Doctor Yorkiche. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And Doctor Yorkiche was supposed to be in the commission to select who is going and who is not -- no, I mean, -- so I ran to her, and I said, "Do you remember how sick he was? </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Do whatever you can do, and she must not have done it because they didn't take him." </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So we were together -- and maybe I should inject it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">When you philosophically think about life, it's true. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">They didn't survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I'm the only one who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">But everyday -- I mean, the life is not forever anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">So that we were together and that we were together until <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> has its great value. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And when we talk about going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I will mention to you that we had a day extra. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">But I think I should do it later. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">My father was also sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">But he also recovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And he had a work, which was much too much for his physical strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So -- but I was able to find him some other work. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I felt always some responsibility for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">When my brother was sick, I prayed that if somebody has to go, let it be me, but not him. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And I always tried to get something. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I was able to get some soup, I was able to pick up some leaves, I was able to go to the <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> of -- I mean, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there were vegetables -- and get the potato, or get something. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">But finally, you know, there was a lot of starvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And I, actually, was never used to -- wasn't a big eater. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">But I was the one who had swollen -- who had edema. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And later on -- that was already '43. '</span><span class="sentence" id="415">43 -- I may be jumping around -- but in '43, many people had tuberculosis, many people had pleurisy, the worst diseases, which were the result of starvation, because there was very little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">It was an accumulated process. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">The body was being starved and being starved and being starved. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">In the beginning, you saw people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> who were much slimmer than they used to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">You could see it in their clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">You could see, when you look at them, they had funny color of skin. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">But later on, there were people working with a lot of edema. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">It was from malnutrition. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And there were many people dying of tuberculosis. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Most of the pathological diseases somehow disappeared, like my father who used to have diabetes. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">He didn't have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">My mother used to have a kidney stone. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">She didn't have the kidney stone. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">It was mostly the effect of malnutrition.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about the food situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">How did you get food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  There were portioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And they were -- see, depending what the German appropriated -- for the ghetto population. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">It was known in the administration of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">They were also very good at knowing where people lived, where people worked, how many people died, how many people -- most of the time, they even knew how many people are deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Only the time when the Germans deported people, probably, they were not able to have the real good statistics. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">So they were able to fix the rations for -- based on how much food it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Now, there were sometimes starvation rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Now, people who had worked were entitled to a soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">The soup was actually some vegetables and it wasn't much. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">But it was something. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And we all were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">So we all had the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And the rations of food were sometimes very, very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">But it was, I was able sometimes to get an additional soup, or something additional. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">We somehow -- I mean, I was actually the smallest eater before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I had -- I had signs of starvations already. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And so -- I sometimes think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">How that everybody -- there was very little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">But it wasn't like -- you know, sometimes you stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> , and you say, "No, we ran out of food." </span><span class="sentence" id="450">It didn't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Everybody -- that's a little minimal, that very little was substandard. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I mean, and it was not sufficient, 1t was a starvation diet. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">But everybody got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And here, maybe -- maybe we should give thought to the way the administration of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> has been formed and of their functioning, that they were able to provide everybody with what little it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">But everybody got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">It was never a situation that somebody was completely left out. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And also, most of the time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , maybe not at the very end, I don't recall any time where there was ever corpses on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , or where there was -- we had to -- it had to be clean, because the Germans would not -- would have closed us up and finished the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> off. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And also, there were in the beginning, and now later on too, but people were after -- they were afraid to go the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , because they were afraid they would be deported the way -- it was a big tragedy. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Human life, as I see it, was very important to everybody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Because I recall that we -- there was a little bit of <span class="REGION">land</span> at <span class="BUILDING">Fresetska eight</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And it has been divided so that we can -- not at the very beginning, but later on -- it was divided so that we could grow some tomatoes, or onions, or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And I, we had also a piece of <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Now, I don't recall that anybody stole anybody's vegetables, and really don't recall it. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And I am very impressed -- I am very impressed with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And as far as the neighbors, where my brother would sleep, they were very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">They disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">They must have been deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">The neighbor who came with us, who helped us with that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> -- they were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And they had a little child. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">In '43, you didn't see any children. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">There were no children in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">In the very beginning, the administration in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> tried to have <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">One time, there was even a graduation. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And to keep up, you know, the intellectual part of life so that we can survive intellectually. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Now, about the German Jews who came in, I remember them. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">They were so different. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">They were, like, normal people. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">QUESTION:  Well, before you tell me about them, when did they come in and how did that happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">ANSWER:  Must have been -- wait for just a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">They might have come in in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">1942 was that big, big deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And they were deported before. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">So it must have been, like, 1941, or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">They came from the lawyers, Germans, Germans who have the iron crosses, I mean, some Mischlings, which means they were married to Jews, some whose ancestry was discovered that they were Jewish, some who were actually Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">But when they came in, they were normal people. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">We were not normal people anymore, not in our -- not in our looks, or not in our way of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Maybe, some intellectually, actually were. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And they also -- some of them brought farce (ph) with them, or different clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">But it was tragic, because it was a very short time they were so miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">They were so miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">But there were also many lawyers. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And some of the lawyers were, had positions later on as prosecutors and judges in the <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">There were <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and there were judges in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and there was a priest in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And so -- and then most of them, the majority of them -- there were some rumors that about 20,000 came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">But many of them, afterwards, were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And there were many musicians. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And at the end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , all the instruments, musical instruments, had been requisitioned -- requisitioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I will just repeat that. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And that's it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="501">QUESTION:  When the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German transports</span> came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , did they mix with the -- with the rest of you, or did they keep to themselves?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">ANSWER:  It probably varied. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">For instance, it varied. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">There was one big industrialist Hirsch (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And I know that my husband let him come to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> where he was and --
QUESTION:  Your present husband?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">ANSWER:  My present.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION:  Not your husband in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">That's my first husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And I was not married --
QUESTION:  No, I know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">But when you say, "my husband" you're talking about fifty years ago?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">ANSWER:  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">My present husband, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And he was -- he was -- it was a Mr. Hirsch. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And he -- he was -- he kept exempt so that he could get us to -- so there was something. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Of course, I'm sure they -- when they looked at us, not properly dressed that there was malnutrition and we probably looked like <span class="NPIP">heck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">So of course, I'm sure they felt superior. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">So unfortunately, after a not very long time, they didn't look very much different than we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">But many talented people were -- were incorporated in the administration of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And the, the musicians were -- there were, sometimes, concerts. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">So they were active there. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And the lawyers were -- were -- some of them were active as judges.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">QUESTION:  In order to bring in all these new people, did it just get more crowded, or had the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> been cleared of a lot of --
ANSWER:  At this time, it had been cleared somewhat, but not completely, because there were people coming from other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> which had been closed, like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pabanitzya</span> (ph), Suskavolya (ph), and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">It was a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And that what -- in retrospect or maybe even then, this very well organized administration of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , with all its flaws and so on, was able to -- to somehow incorporate them, maybe first not in <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">But they were incorporated, and they were -- given food -- they were also buying food with their fares and with the fixed wage they brought. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">But each time there was an influx, somehow -- somehow, the administration of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was doing something about incorporation. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">But later on, there was so many deportations that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> shrunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I mean, you could see when you walked that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> 's shrinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">I don't know whether -- what, maybe, not even one third of the population was there when we were ready to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">QUESTION:  Was there -- you've mentioned a number of things like concerts, <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">So there was --
ANSWER:  In the very beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">It was in the very beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Because then, when the older kids and everybody has to work -- and I understand children who were very young had also to work, so that there was -- the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were only in the very beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Later on, we could not have any <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">They went to middling <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and if -- 1f a person wouldn't work, they could be deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">They had to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And they took, in this awful deportation in 1942 -- children were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And before we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="541">There were no children in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I heard of a -- of a which, Dave my present husband witnessed and mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">See, the Germans were masters of deceit. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">So they were telling stories, like, they were going to take the children and they should be make to look pretty, by whichever means is possible, and that they would be going to better <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And then, this mother had to put the child on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and, right away, she'd become insane. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Tape #2
QUESTION:  You were talking about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and you had mentioned concerts. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Was there some attempt at a normal life there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">ANSWER:  A person who has been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> has to answer that there was no normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">It was absolutely not a normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">We were living in a constant fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And when we talk about concerts, very, very few people actually attended. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">We knew that they were -- in the very beginning, more people could attend. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">But it really is only like a token that something like that existed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="554">But I'm sure that many people didn't even know about the exsistence of the concert, because very few people were able to reveal themselves to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">QUESTION:  Was there a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">ANSWER:  Absolutely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">In fact, there were -- in the beginning, there were some Rabbis. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">But later on, they had to -- they cut their beards off, and they were not able to function. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">In fact, see, they were -- there was a marriage, marriage ceremony. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">At the very end, the only person who can conduct the ceremony was Rumchovsky (ph) -- the Rabbis had no rights to do anything of this kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Services -- there was no services. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">They wouldn't allow that. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">See, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was also changing, it wasn't always the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">If we talk about <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , they were only at the very, very beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Later on, the German wouldn't allow it, they would allow only work, and they demanded work of children who were very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I think anything above 10 -- they had to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">So <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were absolutely out of question. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">The life was really, absolutely not normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">So, let's say, our family -- we were extremely fortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">One -- one reason for our good fortune was a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">In the other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">The <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> was very close to the <span class="DLF">back wall</span> where our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> was standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And very frequently, when we knew there was a deportation, we went down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="574">It was very crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">My brother -- there were two boards to cover that <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">He covered it, and he put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">We would close the shutters. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">So there were quite a few times that we escaped deportation this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">That's why we were able to stay so long before we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">In the same way -- it was no normals, because it was terror, it was fear, there were -- I don't -- I didn't have any social life. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">The life was work, and you came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and there was also -- we were not able to use electricity very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So it was darkness. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And you know, in such a situation as it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , you just want to survive, you are happy that you lived that day, and that your mother lived that day, that your brother is living the day, that your father is living the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">That was -- that was all we wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And nobody even had -- had -- we, you know -- you have -- you accept it that you don't live, actually, for today. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">You accept it that you just -- or you live for today, that you accept that a day passed by without any deportation, without any shooting, without any -- any decrees. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And it was in the time of the -- it was a time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , at the very end, that they were cutting off parts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , so people have to go, have to leave their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and go to others. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">We were fortunate, quote in quote, that we stayed, you know, in this, one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , from the beginning, you know, to the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And when it was very cold -- there were times that it was very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">But I think that they even cleaned the <span class="DLF">streets</span> during the winter, maybe not for us, maybe for the Germans, so that they -- nothing should happen to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And it was lie that we -- they were always some rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And it was -- it wasn't really what you call a life. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">It was a sub -- subliving, subliving. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And see, we -- we had something -- that the war is going well for the Allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And you know, we were hoping. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">We were hoping. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And that this hope kept us alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">But we were not even visiting family. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">First, many of them have already been deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And in fact, my grandfather, my mother's father, and his daughter went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="601">It was a time that, for one reason or another -- I don't know how it was arranged -- but it wasn't -- it wouldn't have -- it wouldn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Because when I told you about this Purim celebration, at this very crowded beautiful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , there is, there are only two people, me and my cousin, Renya (ph), who lives also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> , who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">All of everybody there, all my -- Ciotka Dopcha (ph), Ciotka Hannah, Ciotka Sulcha (ph), Ciotka Peza (ph), and their husbands, and their children -- everybody was murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">On my mother's side, I had family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tomachav</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And I was able, while we were still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , to somehow go there, because I didn't look very typically like a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And we took some money, brought it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tomachav</span> in the hope that 1t would be easier to live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">So she had two small children. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">It was Paula Rosenblum and they perished, they perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">From my mother's side, I had a picture of the Ciotka Rucha (ph), who perished in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , Ciotka Paula, who perished in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tomachav</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And there was, in fact, a brother of my mother who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And sure enough, he was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and murdered, with his wife -- and with his two small children. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Now, we were sure that he would be surviving. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">But he didn't survive even in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">They -- so, you know, when you live in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there is death all around you when people are being deported, when you don't know what will be tomorrow, when everyday they can come and take you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kripo</span> and murder you there, when you are starving, when you are cold, when, when, when there is disease, because there was typhus quite a few times in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , you don't really think that there is something like a social life, you don't think that there is something which would entertain you, or -- we never went to anybody's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And the neighbors somehow were disappearing too. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">They were disappearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And so --
QUESTION:  Do you remember what you talked about when you were at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">ANSWER:  I was thinking about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I was thinking about whether we talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">But we must have talked, because my mother was -- one time, had a dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I do not believe in, you know -- I'm not superstitious at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">But she had a dream that she went someplace, and that she met her brother, who was in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I mean, he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I mean -- I mean, why she had this dream and how this dream came upon I really don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And what did we talk about? </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Now, when --
QUESTION:  Maybe we should stop a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Is that music still here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">ANSWER:  So the life was just -- 1t was to survive, to see that your family survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And I feel that considering that we had, you know, this little -- little <span class="NPIP">places</span> where we could grow vegetables -- and I do not recall anybody stealing. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And I remember kindness from the neighbor and, actually, kindness from the people I worked with. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">So I don't think that I -- [ -- that it 1s a picture -- a rosy picture is el (sic). (</span><span class="sentence" id="632">pause) The way I saw it -- and I do not think that it's something in my imagination -- but anyhow, from my experience -- and I did not have any special standing in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , or any special influence -- but I, myself, experienced a pretty high moral fiber. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And the ... that's what I experienced.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">QUESTION:  Let me ask you; what kind of work did you do in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">ANSWER:  It was actually desk work. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">There were -- we had to issue what was legitimaceje obiadove, which means -- there was a little booklet based on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">You got a stamp that you got the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">It was actually a part of the administration of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , which I was working in. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And it was a job like a bookkeeper's job. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And we were issuing -- it was called legitimaceje obiadove, which means -- such a little booklet, where it was stamped whether -- when somebody got his or her soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And in order to be entitled to the soup, they had to have this booklet. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">So that was my work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Before, I was working in the produce department doing similar work. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And then I was transferred to that department.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="645">QUESTION:  Is this where you met your future husband?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">ANSWER:  Actually, he was the head of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> management in that department. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">He was very strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">He was the first to come -- and he was standing there -- and if somebody dared to come late -- he was just peering at that person, didn't say a word -- I don't think anybody came late anymore -- and was very much respected for -- for his, I would say, noble -- maybe yes, noble behavior and so on -- integrity -- for his integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">QUESTION:  Now, working in the food department, I would think, in a situation like the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- this is a pretty good job?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">ANSWER:  It did not entitle me to any additional food, maybe sometimes a soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">But otherwise, I could not get anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">In fact, I had diarrhea, and I needed some rice, and I approached my future husband, and he refused because he had his reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I am not blaming him. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">But it is very telling that I approached him, and he said, "No," he can not give it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">He had such -- such strong conviction of what he can and what he cannot do -- he wouldn't give it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">He wouldn't take it for himself either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">QUESTION:  So you had no opportunity to --
ANSWER:  I had sometimes --
QUESTION:  -- cheat a little?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">ANSWER:  I had sometimes an additional soup, which I brought and gave to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">But otherwise, I sometimes -- it was a time that I could -- when there were more potatoes in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I could get a few more potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Then we were actually -- the worst -- we found out that there was something growing -- I don't know exactly what it was -- it looked like spinach or something similar -- and we were gathering it, and we were cooking that. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">So that was, of course -- every little bit was helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">QUESTION:  Did people come to you and try to get favors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="663">ANSWER:  I was -- I wasn't the one who they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">So they couldn't come to me for favors, because I am not -- I don't have the means to give anybody favors.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">QUESTION:  Were you aware of much corruption and bribery going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">ANSWER:  I don't know whether I am an optimist, or I have a rosy outlook. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I knew that somebody who was working, let's say in the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> , had more, could get some more bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">But -- and somebody who worked in the police department could have some favors. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Somebody who worked in the Sonderkommando and had -- or helped -- was stationed in the Kriminal Polizei, in the <span class="BUILDING">Kripo</span> , for sure was able to get some favors, some more nutrition, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">If you needed medication, you had to go to the people who were connected to the Polizei, who were either policemen, or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">They were able to bring some, which I -- when my brother was so very sick, you know, I got some medication from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="672">QUESTION:  How?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="673">ANSWER:  I knew somebody who knows somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And so, one time, I got some medication. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And that was in the very beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">In the very beginning, we had -- it was easier to get medication. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">At the end, it was nearly impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And maybe, I felt that it is a matter of fact that people who were associated with these <span class="NPIP">places</span> would have a little bit more nutrition. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">But nobody lived in a beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I don't think anybody -- maybe very few -- had a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="681">They were mostly latrines.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">QUESTION:  There weren't -- you went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">ANSWER:  Yes, we went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="684">Most of the people were living in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">See, it was a part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which was a part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where very poor people used to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">So you know, there were not -- I, you know -- so corruption. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">By the nature -- let's say there was a Sonderkommando, who was very much in touch with the Germans -- I mean, not in touch because they were informers or something -- they were because they were supposed to be performing certain duties. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">It was obvious that they had probably a little bit more food. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">But all -- as I understood it, all was about food. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">They couldn't have much better living conditions, because they were not available -- maybe some people did have running water and some people did not have running water. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Many people did not have running water.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">QUESTION:  Now, you worked in the food administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Was this....
ANSWER:  A part of the food administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">But it --
QUESTION:  You worked on these coupon books for --

<p><span class="sentence" id="695">QUESTION:  -- for people --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">QUESTION:  -- but your department also worked on distribution to food sitters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">QUESTION:  No?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">ANSWER:  We had -- we never saw food. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">We never saw food. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">It was just a bookkeeping department. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I never -- no food went through -- we were a part of the so-called Aprovisation Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">But we were the part, an administrating part, only of this -- of this coupons, coupon books, and we never saw food. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">It never came to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">QUESTION:  Did everybody get coupons? </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Did everybody get the same amount?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">ANSWER:  Everybody who was working was getting a soup.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="709">QUESTION:  And people who were not working how did they get that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="710">ANSWER:  There was -- see, what was happening -- there was a certain amount of food which we're getting besides the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And the food, which they were getting besides the soup, they were getting. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">And if they were working, they were also getting the soup.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="713">QUESTION:  How did they get this, were there <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I mean, how did the poor people -- people who were not working, how did they get food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">ANSWER:  In the <span class="BUILDING">Distribution Centers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">They were -- everybody was entitled to a certain amount of food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="717">QUESTION:  They didn't -- they had coupons?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">ANSWER:  It was called -- wait a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">They were called -- they were cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">They were cards for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">In fact, as I recall one instance after this deportation from -- when the Germans were -- came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and took the people out -- some people who were not expecting to -- expected to be taken -- because they just were not so exact to what they were saying they were going to do -- some people took some of the bread, or whatever, cards with them, and it was a hardship for the others.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">QUESTION:  Let me ask you a different question; do you think that women were treated differently in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">It happened what -- it happens even now. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">The women were living longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I think that, physiologically, the women are equipped with -- because we are the child-bearing species -- that we have certain -- this -- what is chemistry, or there is the glands, or something -- that we can survive easier than the men, because there were more women afterwards in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> than there were men. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">But treatment -- I don't think that we were treated differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">In fact, you know, in Europe, women were treated better, in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I mean, it depends from what point of view you are looking of course, because the man was the man of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the woman, you know, hair drop -- it was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">So there were many women who were in professions. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">There were women doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">There were women chemists. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I had a relative who was a chemist, a relative who was -- had a <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And there were many doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And actually, I wanted to study biochemistry. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">That was my chosen profession which, of course, never happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">QUESTION:  More than -- did you think that there were women who were able to use their appeal, to get favors in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="738">ANSWER:  Not that I was aware of -- not that I was aware of. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">If somebody, of course, worked close to the administration, there is a likelihood. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">For instance, I know, when people got married, they could have asked Rumchovsky to give them -- to give them something. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">But I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I do not think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I might have not come across it. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">But I don't think SO.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">QUESTION:  So how long were you in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="746">ANSWER:  Until the very, very end, until nearly the last day, because I -- I don't have a tattoo. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Because when we came, the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> -- they were so crowded that they didn't tattoo us. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">So it must have been very late in August already when we came. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And we had extra -- an extra day for ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">What happened was that we were on the way which we didn't know is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And we --
QUESTION:  Well, how did -- but how did you even get rounded up; how did all of this happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">They were coming -- in the beginning, they thought we would go full of tyranny [terror]. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">But people didn't go full of tyranny [terror]. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">So the Germans started rounding people up. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">They also came to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">But we had the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , and we closed the shutters, and we went down there, we heard them. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">They were banging with their rifles in many <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="759">But it was that we could pull the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> there -- and it was not usually -- I don't know whether they expected it -- but they banged it on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> -- they did -- but they didn't bang where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">So we did it -- we did 1t whenever, which was probably very, very often -- you know, it was -- we were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And in fact, what happened -- I have the picture of my cousin -- and his whole family was deported, and he came to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And unfortunately, I, my father, my brother, and Aros (ph) -- Aros must have been, maybe, seven years, or something like it -- and we don't have <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for Fishek (ph) -- so -- but there was a <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="763">So we said, "Fishek, we'll hide you there," and we hid Fishek there. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">We got up in the morning, we looked in the <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> , he was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">So the German took him out from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">They were looking everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">They were looking everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">They were just -- just going through everywhere and herding people to go, herding people to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">QUESTION:  And this is in August, 1944?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="770">ANSWER:  That was in August, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And I -- this was -- like, I wish maybe -- I was thinking about hiding there. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">But we didn't have any food, and we didn't know what will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">If we would have known where we were going, we would have probably stayed in that ca...., <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , maybe suffocated. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">But we would stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Now, with the transport --
QUESTION:  What happened, how did you get there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">So this extra day -- I have to tell you about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">So we were on the way to this <span class="BUILDING">gathering place</span> -- and August was just a beautiful month -- and we saw very close where we were supposed to be gathered. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">We saw, like, a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Anyhow, there was a guard, a German guard, in front of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">But it wasn't a Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">So we said, "Can we stay there for a day?". </span><span class="sentence" id="783">He said, "Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">But no more." </span><span class="sentence" id="785">So we took -- we took <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> for a day in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And I was so spoiled that, even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I had to have my spoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And we were there, and -- you know, in retrospect, you sometimes think only, "Did we survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="788">We didn't survive, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="789">We didn't survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">So what good was everything?". </span><span class="sentence" id="791">But no. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Maybe it's philosophical. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And since life is not forever, this one day was also important, because this was the last day that we were a family and that we were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Aros was with us too. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And that's why I think sometimes about this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And I don't want to say, "What good was it that they didn't survive?". </span><span class="sentence" id="797">But they had to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And then we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">It was the most strange thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">I met my cousin and her mother on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> where we were waiting to be taken away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And we stayed together, I and my cousin, until we were liberated, which was very lucky for both of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">She claims that my spirit helped her to survive, because I was just -- when we were working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sasel</span> , one time, we passed by <span class="DLF">windows</span> which were lit, and there was some kind of a holiday, and she mentions to me, "Look, we will never live like that." </span><span class="sentence" id="803">I said, "What do you mean, Renya? </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Of course, we'll live like that." </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And she always repeats it. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And I think that it was the defiance, the defiance. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">I just wanted to defy the Germans, because I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with pleurisy, which is water of the lungs. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">I had a bladder infection. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">I was very sick before we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And when I was lying down naked on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> --

<p><span class="sentence" id="817">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">Since I wasn't -- I was in a very, very small -- my job was administrative. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">But I had nothing to do with food, I had nothing to do with distribution of food, or anything of this kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">So I wasn't so close to the administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">But as a person who lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> from the very beginning to the very end, my assessment is that so it was hunger, so there was deportation, so there were tragedies -- but there was -- somehow, we knew what is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">There were <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Nobody came back from a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with contagious diseases. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">That's another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">But there were <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="826">There were <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> also where children could go. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">There were <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> where people -- if some -- if there was a birth that they could go. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">There was certain civil safety. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">I mean, we were not afraid that somebody would come into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and rob us. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">There were very -- of course, some of the criminals were included in the early deportations. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">That's true. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">There were <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="833">There was a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="834">There were judges. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">There was a prosecutor. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">They had names of everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">They knew where everybody was living. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">There was a Department of Statistics. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">There was a Department of Distribution of Food. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And within this department was the Department of Produce. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">It was a department where they distributed flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">There was a Department of Bakeries. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Now, there was milk and coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">I mean, they knew exactly about how many people we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">I think that could have changed after one of the deportations. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">But they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">They knew about who has an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , or whether there is an empty <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="848">They knew who had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">So it was in this tragic conditions there was something that -- we, for instance, knew that there would be a deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">We, for instance -- besides, there were many rumors which, sometimes, were not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Very often, Rumchovsky had speeches and prepared us for certain things, certain changes, or what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">They were an instrument -- in the beginning, Rabbis were performing ceremonies, if somebody, you know, got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">There were circumcisions performed. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">Later on, when they -- when the Germans didn't allow it, Rumchovsky was the one who married people. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">So for a very short time, there was even something, like -- on the marichian (ph) was something like a reserve for people who worked very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And one time, my brother had the privilege, and I took him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And that was in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> became more and more less run by the Jewish administration, and the Germans had more of a part. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">But this was at the time when Jews had more to say about administration.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="860">QUESTION:  Was this -- do you think that this was positive that Rumchovsky and the Jewish Consul had so much control over your lives?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="861">ANSWER:  Considering the alternative, because if they would not be an order, if there wouldn't be order, if there would be dead people lying all over, if there would be a lot of crime, I believe the German wouldn't go for it, they would just close the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="862">QUESTION:  So you thought he was a pretty good man?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="863">ANSWER:  I -- besides that I saw him, I never met the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">But I'm, what I'm thinking -- in this abnormal condition, with enormous pressure of the German from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , with the population probably being very often not very happy with whats going on, to have this kind of an administration -- so that since we're taken care of, no matter -- no matter what, I think that people who survive the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , if not for this kind of an administration, would not survive it until August the 25, 1944, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> would have been closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And if this workshops, would not be administered, administrated the way they are, they were they were, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> would have been closed also much sooner.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="866">QUESTION:  What workshops are you talking about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="867">ANSWER:  The workshops for the Germans, the workshops -- like, there was a leather workshop, and there was -- there were all kinds of workshops which -- for which, you know, they were paid, and they could use the money to buy the food, and so on and so on, and -- I mean, the administration -- the administration, not individuals -- everything, the administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Now, you know, when you think today what's going on in certain <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , that, under this awful circumstances, they had an administration who had everything in check, they had powers -- of course, they had -- if they wouldn't have the powers, there would be wars there. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Because if somebody wouldn't get enough food or something, no matter whose fault, people would rebel. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">But there were no rebellions. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Anyhow --
QUESTION:  Did you get paid for your work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="872">ANSWER:  Not -- no. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Whether I got -- okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">But --

<p><span class="sentence" id="882">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">I told you about my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And I had enormous -- all -- I mean, respect and all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="885">QUESTION:  Wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">You told me about your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="887">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">I told you that she was beautiful and --
QUESTION:  Oh, you have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="889">ANSWER:  -- that she kept everything so clean --
QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="891">ANSWER:  -- and she would -- took care of me when I was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I took care of my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And she never complained. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And we went into this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle wagon</span> with all these packages, which they deceitfully told us to pack, and she was sitting on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="895">I can sit on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="896">It doesn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">But my mother sitting on this <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and being so unhappy -- it just broke my heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And aI said, she never complained. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And it was so embarrassing. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">It was -- I mean -- and there was a little <span class="DLF">window</span> in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle wagon</span> , and people were trying to look whether we are going. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And, as I said before, the day was absolutely gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And here, she was, poor -- my poor mother was sitting on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and -- I'm not sure -- it must have been the <span class="DLF">air</span> there -- and I don't know what happened to the excrements -- I think there was some kind of an <span class="DLF">opening</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">Anyhow, then they slid the <span class="DLF">door</span> open from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , and we came out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="904">QUESTION:  How long had you been riding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="905">ANSWER:  I do not recall exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">I was just from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="907">From far away, it looked like a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for the insane, because there was some wire around it and there were people running back and forth, back and forth, with shaven heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And here, we had to come out, leave everything in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And then they told us to go to the left, to go to the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And there was one Oberscharffuhrer at the head, closer to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="911">And he said to my mother to go to the left, and I went to the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">And not knowing, really, the depth of that tragedy, I still felt that it means that I'll go to work and she won't. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">So I run up to the Oberscharffuhrer, and I said, " Meine Mutter kann arbeiten viel besser wie ich," which was true, that she can work much better than I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">So he said, " Du willst, sie schon sehen im abend, " that I would see her in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">There were very deceitful, very -- I mean, that this deceit was the smallest deceit -- I mean, because the one which they did to get us out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was a much greater deceit. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Now, I was with my cousin and her mother, Tess (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="917">She had lighter hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">My mother was already, partially gray. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And we went in, and there was a second selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">We were supposed to completely disrobe, which we did of course -- we didn't have any other choice -- and that we will go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> and -- there was something round -- and I was close to my cousin and her mother -- and all of a sudden, they took her mother out. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">It was a second selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Of course, when she was undressed, they realized she is not in her 20s or 30s. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">In fact, only one mother went with us, a Mrs. Kohn (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And what she went through in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> -- she was lashed and whipped so many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">But that's another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Then we, from there, there was -- they shaved our hair -- and I had long brown hair -- and my cousin, Renya, said, "You know, I couldn't recognize you" -- so I was calling, " Tusa, tusa " -- and so I came out and she saw me -- and they shaved our heads -- and we were naked -- and we were supposed to lie down someplace on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> to sleep overnight, which we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Everything seemed completely insane. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">And miraculously, I awoke, I didn't have my bladder infection. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">Then we were given some shoes, and I was given some shoes which had my foot, and we were given some clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And then I remember <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I remember we were standing, one time, in <span class="DLF">line</span> and I had some container with some -- what was supposed to be soup -- and it was all, like, in a <span class="DLF">maze</span> , what was happening, what has happened, I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And what I see someplace, a sign, " Arbeit Macht Frei." </span><span class="sentence" id="932">That was the sign in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And fortunately, we were there only a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And everything seems like a very, very bad dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And they were telling us that going out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camp</span> is a rather fortunate occurrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="936">QUESTION:  Who was telling you that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="937">ANSWER:  It must have been some other person -- people who were already -- have been there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">Some of them were incarcerated people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="939">QUESTION:  Now, you were over in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="940">ANSWER:  Yes, that was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="941">QUESTION:  So you talked to some of the people who were --
ANSWER:  Who were there before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="942">QUESTION:  What else did you observe while you were there in those few days?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="943">ANSWER:  The first impression was that it was some gathering of insane people. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">They just didn't look normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">They absolutely didn't look normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">Their movement didn't -- wasn't normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">That was my first impression when I went out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , and I looked to my left, to my left and -- because we went out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , and then we were standing facing this Oberscharffuhrer here. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">So then I was on the left side -- I mean, I was on the -- my mother was on the left, and I was on the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">So -- and then, as I said, it was like a -- like a bad, bad dream, the whole thing -- it was so unbelievable, the movement of the people, everything there. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">When I think about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I just remember, like, fragments because it was such an enormous shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">It was an enormous shock for, for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">And they took my mother away, and my father, and my -- and Aros and Lolick were also taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">I didn't know where they will be going. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And I didn't realize what actually happened to my mother for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Because, from there, we went to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="956">My leg started swelling up. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And we went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="958">There, we were supposed to be laying <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And there were German woman, women who were our -- I don't know -- they were called Kapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And in the morning, very early in the morning, we have to stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And there was a German SS, and he was pointing out who's going and who's staying. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">In the beginning, I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , there was a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">In most <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , there was a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">They wanted to have us, on one hand, probably, fit, and on the other hand if not, eliminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">So this -- this doctor -- I ask her whether I still have water on the lung. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And she said, "Yes, you have." </span><span class="sentence" id="968">And I had a cut on my leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">So she put a very large bandage on my leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And it so happened that, after I had the bandage, in the morning, she, for a short time, pointed out for me to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">Now, you were asking whether I realized what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">So what actually -- when I started going to work, it was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">It was very hard, to me, to climb on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> because my legs were so swollen. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">But since it was very early, there were stars in the <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> , and I prayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">So I prayed for my parents, and for Lolick, and for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">But -- so at this time, I had no inkling what, actually, is happening to them, absolutely no inkling. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And then we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> for quite a while.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="978">QUESTION:  What was the name of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>

QUESTION:  How long were you there for?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="984">ANSWER:  It wasn't a very long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">But 1t was more than a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">From there, we were transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sasel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="987">And I, as much as it was, the conditions were not good -- this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was situated in a very <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woody area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="988">And I am very sensitive to good <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="989">And also, when we came there, there were always accommodations that the doctor -- there was a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">So when people came from work, they could come there. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">It was called the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="992">Actually, it's like an <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And I approached this doctor and I asked her whether I could work for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And she says -- so she had chosen me to work for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">That also allowed me to recuperate somewhat. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">I had to work, I had to wash the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> , which no big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">It was a big deal for me then because, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">But anyhow -- and when people were coming, I was greeting them, I was taking reports, and I got -- they were saying that I am very polite and friendly to everybody and -- now, this doctor wanted me to sleep with her -- she was afraid to sleep by herself -- which I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="999">QUESTION:  Was she a Jewish woman?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1000">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">She was from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">She committed suicide after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">And so that was going on for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">But then, for one reason or another, I guess she wanted me to sleep with her and somebody else wanted me to sleep in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">But anyhow, somebody else got my position. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">So I was going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">When we were coming from work, we had to stay at attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">And if there were any complaints about anybody during the work of any kind, the person was whipped, and we had all to stand and watch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">And in the middle of this <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> was something -- I don't remember -- some wooden contraption or something where the people were whipped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">Now, one time, I was also punished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And it was -- they claimed -- which I do not know whether it's true or not -- but that I brought some meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">We were working someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">Over there, we were digging <span class="DLF">foundations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">And at one time, we were carrying heavy stones, one giving it to another in a <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">And one time, we were called to a <span class="BUILDING">slaughter house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And they -- he claimed that I took some meat into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">And I had a big speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">I spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">And I was just sentenced to clean the latrines, which -- I don't know whether -- I think I remember it right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">I never felt -- I felt always defiant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">I never felt -- even when I had to clean the latrines, I didn't feel inferior. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">This mother, Mrs.Kohn, has been unfortunatly, she has been lashed and whipped so many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">So over there, one time, I was milking acow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">We were working someplace and we saw cows there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">So I was milking a cow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">But unfortunately, another girl was doing something similar -- I don't know whether it was a cow or it was a bull -- and hit her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">And it was tragic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">There was not enough food and the coats -- the coat was a big problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">And one time, we walked -- worked -- walked to work, and we had wooden shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">And the ice was building up on the shoes and building up on the shoes, and we stopped and wanted to get the ice off our wooden shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">They wouldn't let us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">And it seemed like it will never end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">And I remember that, later on, we used to say, "If this walk ended, anything difficult will end." </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">And --

</span><span class="sentence" id="1181">So it was important to run there and to get the little bit of watery soup in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">Otherwise, you didn't get anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">And there, you realized subconciously and conciously, that I will never see my mother, never see my dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And just -- just lying -- we were just lying on this <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> there day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">Probably, when we had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> , we went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">We must have gone out, because we were able to see this -- this piles, piles, and piles, of skeletons, just skeletons, unburied. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">And they were throwing more and more piling up more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">And, that was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">And I remember when we were liberated, we were liberated by the British. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">There was no joy in my heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">I understand they told us -- somebody told us not to run out too early, one girl did, and she got shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">There was no joy what I was doing, I got some <span class="NPIP">place</span> , some paper and a pen, and I was writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">I write -- and I never thought that I should keep this writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">I'm sure I wrote in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">And I wrote and wrote. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">And, then -- that was liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">Fortunately -- unfortunately, they meant very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">Some people were taken to, like, a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">They meant well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">But they wanted to share with us the food, and they gave some chocolate and other things to people, who were starving for a long, long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">And their stomachs couldn't take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">So they got diarrhea, and some of them didn't make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">And then we must have been taken out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">And we were still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">But, of course, in completely different <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> , and with food and so on, supplied by the British.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1216">QUESTION:  Then how did you know you were liberated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1217">ANSWER:  Probably, the screams, and they probably walked in, and we probably saw the uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">But I know as much as later on, at that point, there was no happiness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">Because after Bergen-Belsen, I -- I knew, that my parents didn't survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">And there was absolutely you know, maybe, seeing all these corpses, and I mean, you couldn't be happy about anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">I wasn't happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">However, once we were transferred to some <span class="INT_SPACE">human quarters</span> , and I wanted to look for my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">He was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">But he didn't survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">And I do not know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">And I was sure that Aros would survive, because he was such a tough young, young boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">I don't know what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">There's no way to find out anything right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">I talked to people who knew my brother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">And that's why I didn't stay long in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> -- I mean, not -- this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> -- but liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">But I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">I got some clothes there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">I don't know how I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">And then I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> , because it was where I was asking everybody -- I was inquiring whether anybody saw Lolick, and whether they know, and maybe he registered someplace or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">But, he did not survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">He did not survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">And so everybody, everybody from this enormous family was tortured, starved, gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">And there is a story.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">Because the Germans were also getting coupons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">At that time, it was rationed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">And we got an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and we got -- we got food -- and we got some clothing, and we started what you would call the beginning of a normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">Some people, you know -- that -- that's what was happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1276">QUESTION:  Was it difficult to resurrect yourself in a way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1277">ANSWER:  I have to admit that it -- I remember some extreme elation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">Not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">Not when I was -- but when I started -- when I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> -- I don't know whether it started there or much later -- but I was so elated that I am alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">I just -- my cousin, Renya, was just, like, envious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">I mean, she was happy about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">But she was envious that -- I mean, I felt that Iam alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">And it was -- it was a elation for me to -- it -- I went through this grieving period for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">And I was -- we were always grieving, we were always talking about it, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">But this -- this absolute transformation for being not even a human being -- and all of a sudden, being free -- when I realized it, I was -- there was a period -- it didn't last forever -- but it was a period of great elation.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1289">ANSWER:  No, it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1290">QUESTION:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">Sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1292">ANSWER:  We actually stayed there for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">We also were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">And yes, the reason we stayed so long in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was we wanted to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as soon as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">There were too many memories and you never knew to whom you're talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">Because if they told you that they always were buying into your <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> -- or something like that -- then you know: "Watch out." </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">Then we didn't want to -- but anyhow, Dave had a sister in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">So actually, they were doing something to send us status. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">However, I had no pleurisy in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and also in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">And so I didn't have the pleurisy when I was liberated just miraculously. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">On an x-rays, there were shadows. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">And the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , very rightfully, didn't want to let people in with tuberculosis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">They would have let somebody in with pleurisy, because it's not contagious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">So I had a very hard time, to, until they declared me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">It took a long time because -- we came here in 1950, liberated in 1945 -- until I got a <span class="DLF">clearing</span> that I can go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">And that's why it took so long for us to come here to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1307">QUESTION:  So you and David got together pretty soon in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1308">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">Well, we got married in 1946, March 16th. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">And you know, the lady in whose <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we lived, who we met afterwards -- she just couldn't believe it, that we got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">You see, there is a big age difference between David and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">But it really -- he's -- I mean, he's a young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">So he now believes that he's -- am I on tape still?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1314">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1315">ANSWER:  Oh!</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1316">QUESTION:  You know, one thing that's confusing to me -- I've never heard this before about both you and your husband -- 1s -- I didn't realize, that you were sort of operating with German authorities, as opposed to with British -- the British military Government or the American military Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1317">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">Now, we got the British Government -- and that was a UNRR, UNRR -- they were also helping. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">Now, I don't know whether <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">KZ Ausschussz</span> was later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">Formed later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">I would have to check with Dave exactly where it was -- where it was formed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">Because in the very beginning -- I have a picture with La Guardia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">And yes, in the very beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">This happened later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">That's what -- what we are telling you about the KZ Ausschuss. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">It didn't happen immediately after the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">It didn't happen immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">Because at this time, we were being sent supplies from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to the UNRR, and La Guardia came, and, since I was involved in with the <span class="BUILDING">distribution center</span> of the food -- but this was food given directly to people -- and La Guardia came -- and there's a picture of him with me -- he was so shocked when we were telling him what was actually happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">So in the very beginning, there were not so -- the people started coming, you know -- more and more people started coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">And then when -- that's how, that's how I remember it -- because in the beginning, we weren't old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">That was -- the beginning, we were on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auerstrasse</span> (ph), and food was coming, yes, to the UNRR.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1332">QUESTION:  And you got involved in food distribution?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1333">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">I was working together with others and we were -- yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1335">QUESTION:  When you were in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and you were with your cousin, do you remember what you talked about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1336">ANSWER:  We wanted to keep our sanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">So when we were digging this foundations in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sasel</span> , we were doing some algebraic in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">We were doing square roots, when we had a little bit of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">And um.... See, we were going to the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">She's a little -- she was a little -- in a little bit older class than I. So this, we remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">That we had a little bit free time, and we were were doing the algebretical roots. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">So you know to keep the sanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1343">QUESTION:  Did you think about religion at all; did you pray?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1344">ANSWER:  I never stopped praying -- I think that I never stopped praying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">I do not pray -- I mean, I change the way I pray. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">Very frequently, and I pray with my own words. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">But I don't think -- I might not have prayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">I might not have prayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">But I prayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , because I remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">And, I don't know whether it 1s, has something to do with my upbringing, or whether it has something to do with my spirituality. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">And I think that we have certain powers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">Maybe powers is too strong a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">But we were -- in the worst of times even, we have some abilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">Not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">Not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">But we have some abilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">We have -- and I think they are, maybe -- you could say they are God-given. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">And so I keep praying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">I keep praying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">I keep -- actually, my way of praying is, if this 1s important, a way of thanking God for what I want to have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1361">QUESTION:  Let me ask you one more question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">And if there's anything you want to add. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">Have you thought about what sort of long-term impact these experiences have had on you, and, and have influenced the way you are today?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1364">ANSWER:  It is absolutely miraculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">I went, in the very beginning, after in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , through some times which I was very -- I may be depressed, nervous, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">It's likely that, having been blessed with two sons and two daughter-in-laws and four grandchildren, and having worked also on my physical and emotional health through things like yoga and others, I am, actually right now, in a very good, very good <span class="NPIP">place</span> emotionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">Because I could talk about it and I could -- when my husband was testifying at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">UCLA</span> [University California-Los Angeles], there's no way I was able to testify. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">It still -- when I think about it, even about testifying, especially about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I was having butterflies in my stomach. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">However -- and I cannot watch any -- anything on television about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">And when I watched the first time when there was a Holocaust story, I was sick for quite a long time because I have a visual memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">And when I hear something, it doesn't affect me so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">But when I saw it, I cannot see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">I cannot see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">And I try -- since I don't do any good to anybody and I have my responsibilities -- so I try not to look.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1375">QUESTION:  Can you think of how -- could you talk about it after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1376">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1377">QUESTION:  It took you a while?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1378">ANSWER:  Yes, we couldn't talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">In the beginning, we just could not talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">And I couldn't talk about it for quite a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">And, my son was always -- when I started talking quite recently, he was, was, like -- in a way, he was pleased that I talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">He'd be very surprised that I was able to testify, with pretty much of a composure, because I -- Dave was talking -- my husband -- I couldn't -- I was always, want to protect everybody from everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">Now, I have a little number which I was wearing in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">And my granddaughter wants it, she said, "Don't give it to anybody," she wants it -- so probably -- I will show it to you -- probably when she will ever eventually give to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1385">QUESTION:  Can you think of any other way that these experiences have affected the way you've lived for the last 50 years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1386">ANSWER:  What really affected me is my upbringing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">I was brought up to respect elderly people -- and I don't forget that I am one of them right now -- I was taught to be honest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">I was taught that you're supposed to be charitable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">We never were taught to hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">And I think it's not so much the experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">But the way I was brought up, there are certain things I just would not do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">I wouldn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">Because this period of time -- of course, it is a big -- it's not a void -- a hurt -- my main concern 1s actually whether when my -- especially, my mother -- my father, of course, too -- when they went into this <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , whether -- hopefully, they didn't suffer too much -- that is my very, very important concern. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">And I do not want to investigate too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">Because I don't off -- on the one hand, in the beginning, I was hoping it was instantaneous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">But I understand it was not instantaneous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1397">QUESTION:  What are we looking at, Estelle?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1398">ANSWER:  This is a photograph taken in a <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> which we spent the summer in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">And there is my dear mother, Hannah Ryba Weingarten (ph), my dear father, Yakaf Weingarten (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">And there is my dear, handsome brother, Herschlipe Weingarten (ph), we called him Lolick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">And that's me next to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">I was about five years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">And let me remember them the way -- the way -- the way they were here, and not think that they were gassed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1404">QUESTION:  What are we looking at?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1405">ANSWER:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">This picture was taken in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portumbina</span> , where we had a <span class="BUILDING">summer home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">And I am picking up the balls and my brother, who is at the right, is playing with -- and his name is Lolick Weingarten -- he is playing with Fishek, my cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">I mentioned his name because, before going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , after his family was deported, he came to us and we tried to hide him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">And there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in our <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">And there were already five people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">And we hid him in a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">But unfortunately, the SS found him and took him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> a few days before we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1413">QUESTION:  What year do you think this picture was taken?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1414">ANSWER:  I must have been here, maybe, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1415">QUESTION:  So the early 1930s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1416">ANSWER:  Yes, it would be in the early 1930s. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1417">pause) On this photograph, on the left, standing, is Felka (ph), my cousin, Felka Weingarten. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">And on the right is Ritcha (ph), Ritcha Weingarten. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">And I am in front of Felka, and my brother, Lolick Weingarten, is in front of Ritcha. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">Unfortunately, Felka perished in the Holocaust and Ritcha, her husband, and her baby, perished in the Holocaust also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">Rest their memory. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1422">pause) This is my aunt, Paula Rosenblum, a sister of my mother's. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">She perished in the Holocaust together with her husband and three small children.
