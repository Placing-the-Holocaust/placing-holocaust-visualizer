<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  No.</span><span class="sentence" id="187">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And, obviously, he wasn't in one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , though, he was probably marching. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Because it was a whole, you know, like, a march into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And it was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , I mean, it was a cosmopolitan city. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I don't know how many people, but, you know, it had <span class="BUILDING">cinemas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">It was a very contemporary <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="201">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  But it's amazing, even to me, that -- well, you know, it's a pretty momentous situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I mean, there's so many things that I don't remember later, although I do remember -- well, we will go into that, how we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And that was an amazing situation, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">But you probably will want to ask me Q:uestions about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  Yeah, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">We'll get into that in a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Do you remember anything else about when they came in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  No, I don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Because after that, I don't -- things didn't change that much at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I mean, I think I still, you know, went to the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> and -- at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">You know, later on, of course, it was totally changed and the children were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Most of them, you know, was murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">But in the very beginning, it hadn't hit yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So in March they -- you remember them coming in, and then when did you leave for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Now, it's very difficult for me to give you an actual date, but let me tell you how we left for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">The Germans -- my mother wanted to take us to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> where my father was. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And there was no way she could get permission, but somehow she was able to talk -- now, you know, this was something that I found out a lot later- to someone in the German, well, authority -- and she was a charmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">She was an absolute charmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And she was able to talk them into her taking her two children to visit her father who was dying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">That was my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">He was actually dying, he did have stomach cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And so we just put on clothes, you know, a couple layers of clothes and went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">The amazing thing is, that she was able to ship things to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">You know, which is an unusual story, because, you know, usually you just leave everything and that's the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">But to this day, I have menorahs.</span><span class="sentence" id="229">My daughter now has beautiful candlesticks, and, you know, many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And I was asked if I would donate stuff to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and, actually, I want to keep it for my children, and grandchildren --

<p><span class="sentence" id="235">ANSWER:  Yes -- no, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , to my father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  And -- but then when we left, we left with nothing and went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And she stayed with my grandfather and I was taken care of by, you know, my cousins and aunts and my brother, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And my grandfather died. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And he died, actually, I guess it was beginning of August of 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And she sat Shiva. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I don't know if you know what that is, Shiva is the seven days that you sit after someone dies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">ANSWER:  And then she tried to talk her sisters and brothers to let her take their children to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And everybody said, no, you know, he's got <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and that's going to be it. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">You know, he's -- you know, that's -- and they -- nobody left except for my mother, my brother, and I.

QUESTION:  Can you spell that for us?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  G-D -- gu din (ph) -- N-I-A I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Gud (ph) -- oh, Y. Let me just write it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">The thing 1s that that <span class="DLF">port</span> changed many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">That <span class="DLF">port</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> and also <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Danzig</span> when it was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Danzig</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdynia</span> would be G-D-N-Y -- gu din (ph) -- A I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> is probably easier to spell. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">It's G -- gurs (ph) -- D -- dunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">G-D-E-N-A-S-K I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  But it's been -- you probably can look it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="263"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Danzig</span> the different names that it's gone under. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">You know, these things went back between <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and went across the English Channel --
QUESTION:  So this is your mother, yourself, and your brother, correct?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  I don't think -- you know, it was still -- you know, she had a passport, I think, and you were able to travel in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I mean, this was before the Germans invaded and - I mean, my father had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">They traveled all over, all over Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">ANSWER:  And so, you know, they had passports or whatever they needed to travel.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">QUESTION:  And what was your father doing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">ANSWER:  He went on business, you know, to -- no, my father went on business. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">But my father was a worrier, and that will explain what happened to him later. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And he, I think, foresaw that things were going to happen, and so he went to, to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> on business.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So he was the one who instigated you coming across to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to meet him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Oh, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">I mean, we wouldn't have gone otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">He -- he had gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And I can't tell you how long he was there, but I can tell you that when he - we came there, he was only 39.He was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with a heart attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So the pressures and the strains, you know, of the family -- and between my father and my mother, they were able to get us over there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">QUESTION:  Did you need special permission from the British to stay there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">ANSWER:  No.</span><span class="sentence" id="293">That's such an interesting thing because the British -- actually, there were many refugees that came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Most <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , including <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , including, you know, so many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , even in <span class="REGION">South America</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , you know, nobody really wanted the Jews to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">But my father was there on business, and it's not just -- we then made friends with a lot of other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">In fact, I'm still a close friend of somebody who came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravska Ostrave</span> that were close friends of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">The name was Winer, (ph) and she's now married. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Her name is Honey Arnold. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">She's still alive and she's in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And we're still in touch and close. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">We visit there and they visited here. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And there were probably oh -- not dozens -- there were many, many people that came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And that is amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I don't know, because I know the British have not always been wonderful, they were very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> at the time of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> being established, and certainly the British were pretty bad about letting Jews into <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span><span class="sentence" id="307">So we were just very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">We did have an -- my mother had an aunt there, her sis -- her mother's sister lived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And so we actually lived with her for a little while until we got established in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">But that was not an easy time either, because it was wartime and the Blitz and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">But, you know, these are things that, as I got older, you know, I remembered more things about what happened and our evacuation and the bombings and going into the <span class="BUILDING">underground shelters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And so it was a difficult time, but as children, you sort of adapt to what it 1s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">QUESTION:  We'll talk about -- more about the Blitz in a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Can you first tell us -- did you have other family members that stayed behind in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravska</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Well, actually, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szinov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">My two grandparents, my father's -- my father was an only child, and the only family we had were his parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And we used to visit -- oh, that was something I forgot to mention. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">As a child, we used to go out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szinov</span> and they had a big <span class="DLF">garden</span> with fruit. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And we used to go and pick berries. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So we had a- really had a very nice childhood in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Well, it was pretty short. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">But they stayed there and, unfortunately -- well, maybe fortunately for him, my grandfather also passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">But my grandmother, Ella, her name was Ella Brenner, his name was David Ginsberg, she did not survive and was killed by the Nazis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">QUESTION:  Was she deported to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> or --
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">But, actually, not from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Because of my mother's big -- my mother had a very big family as opposed to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">She actually went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , and from there she was deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And I don't know exactly where or when, but she was killed, as was my mother's mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">They were both killed by the Nazis, as were a couple of my mother's siblings and some children, so...
QUESTION:  If you -- we do some research here at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , so if you're interested in finding out more information, we might be able to look that up for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">ANSWER:  Well, that would be great.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">ANSWER:  Her name was Ella Brenner -- well, Ginsberg.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">ANSWER:  And my other grandmother was Erlich, Eva Erlich, maiden name of Corow. (</span><span class="sentence" id="336">ph)
QUESTION:  And I think after the recording, maybe if you can email me the information, and I'll pass it on to the researchers here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">ANSWER:  Well, that would be very, very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">My cousin, by the way, Zvi Barlev who ended up, besides writing the book, being with the Israeli Diplomatic Corp.He was -- after all he'd gone through, he was first secretary in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> .</span><span class="sentence" id="340">Actually, it was in <span class="BUILDING">Buckingham Palace</span> with the Q:ueen. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">He was also first secretary in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">He did a lot of research. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And we, actually, you know, have a -- he put together a family tree. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Not so much of my father's side like Ella Ginsberg, but of the Ehrlich side, which was my mother's maiden name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">QUESTION:  Did you spend a lot of time with him growing up, or was he a different age?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">ANSWER:  He was older. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">He was, you know, Q:uite -- well, several years older, and not that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Because he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , he visited us and we visited there. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">But it, you know -- a visit would be a short visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">But I've been very close to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">We've been to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> now 26 or 27 times. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And so, you know, we've been in touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And they've been here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  Because he -- as I said, you probably can find the book at, you know, at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">So that -- but there are a lot of books that have been written, but, of course, this one was published -- I guess it was a self-publish thing by Vantage. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And it did have a forward, actually, I think, by Elie Weisel even.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">ANSWER:  It was translated from the Hebrew, not only into English, but into Swedish and Norwegian. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And so the book was in a few different <span class="NPIP">places</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">QUESTION:  When you first came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , did you live in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">ANSWER:  No, we went to live with my great aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">It was my grandmother's sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">We lived with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">She had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at Six and Andrews Grove in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stamford Hills</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And we lived with her because my father was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , as I said, with a heart attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">But once he recovered, then we moved into an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> at Two Stamford Hill Mansion.</span><span class="sentence" id="368">And that's where we lived until -- I mean, we lived there the whole time, but I was -- we were evacuated part of the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">QUESTION:  Where did you go when you were evacuated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">ANSWER:  A <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , which is now a bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kennington</span> , outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kennington</span> --
QUESTION:  Was that just you and your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">ANSWER:  And my mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">ANSWER:  And my father used to come on the weekends. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">He would be working in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">He was still working, he had his business. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">But terrible, terrible strains. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Terrible strains, you know, trying to keep the family as safe as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">In fact -- and I mentioned this to Ashley, but I will tell you, I guess, it was in 1940 things looked so bad in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And we thought that -- the Germans had invaded everywhere -- that it looked like they might be coming into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So my father, being the wotrrier that he was, said we're going -- we had an uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">He said we're going to send the children to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And we stood in <span class="DLF">line</span> and applied for all the papers that you need for that and got everything and were scheduled to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and go to -- actually, I think it was <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , but then <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">It left from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was sunk, and, I think, 70 some odd children died on that and other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">But at the last minute, my father decided we're stick -- keep the family together. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">So even though we had all the papers to go, we didn't go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="389">QUESTION:  So it would have just been your mother and you and your brother on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and he would have stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">ANSWER:  Actually, I think it would have just been the children, just my brother and I. You know, like -- it was like the Kindertransport, but it was a little different. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">You know, it was something that they were trying to arrange to get kids out of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> when it looked very dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">ANSWER:  And I don't know about my mother at that point, but I do know that we had all the papers we needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And then the discussion with the family and my father said, no, we're going to stay together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">QUESTION:  Do you remember anything else about that, what he explained to you about first going on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">He said, you know, I -- that the family needs to stay together, but we'll try and stay safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And we did in those days of the Blitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">It's an amazing thing, Heather, but the kids used to like to go down into the Underground because they'd run around with all their friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">You know, children are amazing, I mean, how they adapt to different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And we would go into the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> , you know, when the sirens would go off.</span><span class="sentence" id="402">And then we'd be with other kids and other friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And that -- they sort of learn to adapt to the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And it was interesting because a lot of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">But there was one <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that stayed open, and it happened to be a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And, of course, I was Jewish, as were a number of my friends, and the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> allowed us to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And not only allowed us to come to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but we had asked if when they had their catechism and everything else, could we have a Jewish teacher come in and they allowed us to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">So for part of the time -- and I ended up with a very -- even though I was evacuated and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kennington</span> in a one- room schoolhouse with my brother, who was four years older than I was, and then coming back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and going to the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , by the time I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> -- we're getting ahead of ourselves -- but I started <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And because of the years of education I had, they put me in as a freshman. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">But after I was there for six months, I became an upper junior because of all the subjects we'd already had, even during the wartime.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And we'll talk more about that in a minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">ANSWER:  I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I'm sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">QUESTION:  That's okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Can you talk more about -- did you understand what was going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">QUESTION:  What did you understand about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">ANSWER:  We understood that the Germans were bombing and were hoping to come into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And we really felt, maybe because where we came from -- the British may not have felt this way, maybe they felt a little stronger, you know, that no one 1s going to come in here. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">But after seeing what had happened in Europe, there were times that we really thought that the Germans would come in and invade <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">QUESTION:  And did you understand why they wanted to come in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">ANSWER:  I understood that Hitler wanted to rule the world and get rid of the Jews, one of the things that he wanted, one of the main things that he wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And the amazing thing is that somewhere or other they said that somewhere in his background there was some Jewish blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And, you know, sometimes those -- you can get Jews sometimes that are so self -- not that he was Jewish, I'm not trying to say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">But they can be self-hating and worse than anyone else against the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">We did understand that, as Jews, we were very vulnerable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  And did you experience any anti-Semitism in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">ANSWER:  Well, I know there was anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">But when I think about my experience at the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and the friends that I made and that -- one of the gals that was in my class actually became the mother superior, and I visited her on one of our many visits to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I really had very positive feelings about, you know, how other people treated us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  How did you know that there was anti-Semitism if you didn't experience it yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">ANSWER:  Well, I imagine -- I knew what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Well, I didn't know at that time about things like the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">But I knew that -- that's a good Q:uestion. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">ANSWER:  I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Maybe it was --
ANSWER:  But there definitely was anti-Semitism in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I mean, I've read many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">You know, people resented the Jews coming in and taking jobs away and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">So I know that it definitely existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">But we happened to live in a very <span class="REGION">Jewish area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">It's even more Jewish now than when we lived there, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stamford Hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And so our friends with Jewish -- now, there was a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> there, but we belonged to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and attended services and really participated in Jewish life there, again, celebrated the holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Friday nights my father would bring home people for dinner without even talking to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So we'd always have guests at Friday night dinners. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And things were rationed, but somehow we managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">In fact, I remember my parents never eating an egg because they wanted to give -- we got two eggs or something -- giving the eggs to, you know, to my brother and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">They figured we needed them more than they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">So we had, really, you know -- they were difficult times. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And we certainly didn't have the same kind of life that we had in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">My mother was not working. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">But, you know, she had to clean the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and clean the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And I'd help her, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So it was a different, different life, but still --
QUESTION:  Was your father working?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">ANSWER:  Yes, my father was working.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">QUESTION:  And as a fur merchant or --
ANSWER:  Yeah, still in the fur business, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">QUESTION:  Do you remember anything else about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">ANSWER:  He had a partner, I remember, Arpud, (ph) and must have done okay because, you know, we had food as much as we could, you know, with rationing. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">We had a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">We were always --
QUESTION:  So you managed to keep a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Interestingly enough, and at least in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kennington</span> , I have no idea because they had never seen a Jew before. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And when we came there, they actually wanted to know if we had horns. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And, again, my mother, ended up charming them. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">She'd invite them over and she'd bake strudel and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And there we were billeted or lived with an Anglican minister in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , you know, when we were evacuated, my mother, my brother, and I. And when my father came, he would stay there, too, and --
QUESTION:  Was it just him or did he have a family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">ANSWER:  No, he was single. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">His name was Reverend Williamson. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And he particularly, I must say, liked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">That might sound difficult today. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">But as long as we lived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , he would never forget my birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And he was very kind to us, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">So, you know, it's interesting, you know, with all the anti-Semitism going along, the people that we dealt with were very kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION:  Did you meet a lot of other people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kennington</span> as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">We lived next to a girl who became one of my best friends there by the name of Marge Hoggnet. (</span><span class="sentence" id="483">ph) I've lost touch with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">She eventually moved to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">But I -- I tried to locate her. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Not Jewish, they were farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And they had chickens and they actually had sheep. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And I actually helped with -- I didn't really help, but I was there and they let me do some sheering of sheep. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And so it was, again, a different -- very nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And they -- a lot of it had to do with the way that my mother behaved and, I guess, the way we behaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And we -- there was only a one- room <span class="BUILDING">schoolhouse</span> , you know, where all the kids went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">As I said, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with my brother, but -- who was four and a half years older than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">But we had a <span class="BUILDING">schoolhouse</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">QUESTION:  Were you in the same class?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">ANSWER:  Yes, it was just one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Oh, yes, just one class. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">It was just one class.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">QUESTION:  So you went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kennington</span> and then a different <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">ANSWER:  Correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">QUESTION:  And how long were you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kennington</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="501">ANSWER:  Well, we were there two different times. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">One was earlier, you know, when the Blitz was really bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And the second time -- and I don't know the exact dates, you probably can look that up -- when the buzz bombs came over and they decided it was too dangerous to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">The buzz bombs were the ones that you could hear, and then when they stopped they would drop and blow up whatever they landed on. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And that was later, you know, maybe in '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">The first one was maybe around '40, '41.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION:  Do you remember how long you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kennington</span> each time, was it months or years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">ANSWER:  It wasn't years. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">It would be several months. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Because we would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford</span> , and near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford</span> there was actually an American Air Force base and we used to see the Yanks. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And there was an expression that the kids there used, got any gum, chum.</span><span class="sentence" id="512">You know, just -- you know, it was something that we would say if we met an American. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And I did meet a couple of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">But, you know, how old was I, 10, 11, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">We were young.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">QUESTION:  Do you remember anything else about the Americans on the base?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  We didn't ever go to the <span class="BUILDING">base</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">They were just young, nice guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">You know, this was- actually, let's see, <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> went into the war in '41, so the first time -- I don't think they were -- the first time we were there, I don't think they were even at war yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">But there were some American soldiers that did come to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And there was a <span class="BUILDING">base</span> -- and I don't know exactly where it was -- but it was somewhere near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford</span> .</span><span class="sentence" id="522"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford</span> 1s a beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , very historic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">QUESTION:  So what else do you remember about the Blitz and --
ANSWER:  Well, after it was over, we would go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and we would try to collect shrapnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Now, none of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> where we lived, you know, were hit or blown up. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">But there was -- you know, there was a lot of damage. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And one of the things that we did as kids is we would go out, you know, and collect shrapnel.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">QUESTION:  And did you find a lot of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">ANSWER:  We found some. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Found some.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">QUESTION:  And who did you collect it with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">ANSWER:  Other kids, other children that I was friendly with. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Like, even this girl that I mentioned to you, but there was -- there were other friends, you know, that we made as youngsters, you know, from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Usually it was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">QUESTION:  Did you ever talk amongst yourselves about what was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">ANSWER:  In the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Yeah, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">I don't think we realized how, how horrific it was in Europe, you know, as children. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Certainly my parents did. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And I know that they did communicate for a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">There was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> where all the family was, including the grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And they got a picture of her -- that's my mother's mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And -- but as I mentioned to you, my father, you know, the stress and the strain was really tremendous on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And --
QUESTION:  Your grandmother was able to write to your mother, though?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">ANSWER:  In the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="549">ANSWER:  In the beginning, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">But, you know, then things got much worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And we didn't really talk about these things like -- we always had dinner together. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And I think my parents tried to have us have as normal a life as you possibly could. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">One of the things that was rather interesting was that, as a youngster -- and this is when I -- I don't even remember at what age -- I developed appendicitis and I didn't want to admit it. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And, actually, it ended up rupturing. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">This was the days before penicillin.</span><span class="sentence" id="556">And my father, who is very religious -- and, as I said, we were as kosher as we could be, you know, and we were.</span><span class="sentence" id="557">You know, we kept separate dishes and -- for whatever food we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And when I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> -- I'll never forget this -- and they didn't have much meat or anything else, and the only thing they had was bacon. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And he said I want you to eat that because it's more important, you know, to save your life than to worry about kosher.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">QUESTION:  How long were you in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="561">ANSWER:  Good Q:uestion. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">You know, it's funny how you remember some things and don't remember others. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">But it was ruptured and I was very, very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">As I said, there were no antibiotics at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And it was probably at least a couple of weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">QUESTION:  Do you remember what year that was or how old you were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">ANSWER:  No.</span><span class="sentence" id="568">Isn't that funny? </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">But I was little, maybe nine. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Eight, nine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">QUESTION:  Do you remember being underground during the bombing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">QUESTION:  And how -- can you tell me more about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">ANSWER:  Well, there were different ways that we could be underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">There were <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> , which were near the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And people from the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> would go to the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> and stay there until there was, you know, there was a siren, and then there was an all clear siren. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">So you would go to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">But the ones that I remember the most is when we went into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Undergrounds</span> , which -- have you ever been to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="581">ANSWER:  Then you know how deep they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And we would go down to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Underground</span> and actually sleep down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And you're going to ask me how often did we do that, I don't know, but it was Q:uite a few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And as children, we actually -- I'm not going to say had -- but we actually, you know, we went around and saw our friends and -- it's such a strange situation where you live in a difficult situation, but you kind of adjust to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="585">QUESTION:  What was the environment like down there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">ANSWER:  A lot of people, and, you know, with blankets and they would sleep down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And all -- you know, families would sort of stay together. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And it wasn't that often that we'd go into the Underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">But thefew times that I remember, it was not that -- it sounds like an awful experience, but it wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I don't know how to describe that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">QUESTION:  Did you bring food with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Yeah, we'd bring some food with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Yeah, maybe sandwiches or something, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Whatever you had because there wasn't that much available. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Talking about food, another thing I will remember always is my father buying me a peach for two and six pence, which was a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">That was a Q:uarter of a pound. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And it was- you know, it was something I just remember, because fruit -- you know, it was hard to get fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="599">QUESTION:  And that was something you took down there into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Underground</span> with you —
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">QUESTION:  -- to eat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">ANSWER:  No.</span><span class="sentence" id="602">That was the time that we were actually in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West End</span> and somebody was selling fruit and he bought it for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">We still did things, you know, I went with my father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">QUESTION:  And, at this time, you were also still going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Yeah, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> all the time that we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And we had -- you know, we had to work hard and study hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And we had good teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Some were nuns, some were not nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">I remember a Sister Ursula who had a very good sense of humor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="612">QUESTION:  Now, what else do you remember about the nuns?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">ANSWER:  Well, they were strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">You know, on my report cards -- which I think I still have somewhere -- it was -- I was a very good student at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I usually -- this gal who eventually became mother superior and I were always like, first, second in the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And on my report card, I'd have all these nice grades. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And then on the conduct, it would say very good conduct but she talks too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">So I guess I'm still doing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="619">QUESTION:  And your brother was not in the same class with you at this time, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="620">ANSWER:  No.</span><span class="sentence" id="621">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">This was an all girls' school. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">He was in another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and he had a lot of -- he was very social and he had a lot of friends, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">| And I remember the friends, and, you know, they were handsome young men. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And they used to, you know -- used to bother them and they would always sort of try to get rid of -- from all their activities, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">That's the way, you know, it is with brothers that are older.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">QUESTION:  So outside of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , do you remember spending a lot of time with your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">ANSWER:  Not that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Because he -- you know, he was with his friends and I was with my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And we did spend time at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kennington</span> , we were in the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And he put up with me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">QUESTION:  Now, what was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> like after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">ANSWER:  Well, it -- 1945, you know, things slowly, slowly started getting better. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And, of course, this is where -- by that time, I was 12 and --
QUESTION:  Do you remember when the war ended?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">ANSWER:  Ended? </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And there were, you know, big celebrations. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And -- but then the thing that I remember a lot is how I felt as a Jew with the fact that <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> was not allowing, you know, Jews to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">We were -- oh, I was part of a youth group, and it was a Zionist youth group. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">It's called B'nai Akivah.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1089">ANSWER: Physically, not as close as I would like. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">But my daughter and her husband live up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santa Cruz</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> , so it's an hour's flight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">My son lives in the <span class="REGION">San Fernando Valley</span> , which is about an hour and 20 minute drive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">But we still get together Q:uite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">In fact, we were just with my son and daughter-in-law down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Diego</span> with the children this past weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">That's why we haven't been around, you know, I had to give you this date. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">And then the next day we were with my son, daughter-in-law, and one of their children, because three of their kids are now in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1106">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">I never taught on a full-time basis, I really only taught part time.</span><span class="sentence" id="1108">I taught at a <span class="BUILDING">community college</span> , and, really, it was a very good experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">And some of my students have done very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">And then after that, I taught at, again, <span class="BUILDING">state university</span> , actually, where I got my master's. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">Because I knew the people there and so then they hired me there, too, and I taught.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1122">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">But she did live to be 89 and worked in our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , ran the <span class="BUILDING">gift shop</span> , was very popular, was very involved in the community and was very happy here, as were my in-laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">Very involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1125">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">Is there anything else you can tell me about <span class="REGION">California</span> that we haven't touched upon or that you would like to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1127">ANSWER:  Well, we live in a very -- you know, it's a nice community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">It has its problems, smog and probably a lot of other things because we're ringed by <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">But a very close community, especially through the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , which is where we have a lot of our friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">And I'm involved in something called Osher and something called LIFE, which is Learning is Forever, which is through the <span class="BUILDING">University of California</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riverside</span> which is for seniors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">And we have lectures and programs and different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">So, you know, it's very nice being in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">university town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">As I told you, I enjoy learning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And so, I think -- as I used to tell my students, learning is not for making a living, it is for living and you should learn as long as you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">And so I enjoy that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">also volunteer with an organization called HiCap, which is health insurance counseling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">Because I helped my mother when she was ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">And seniors -- because I'm a senior, too -- but a lot of seniors have a tough time navigating the healthcare system, and probably is going to get worse, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">So that's something that I volunteer with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And then I do stuff through the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , you know, on education. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">And my husband, as I told you is still teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">And we -- and whenever we have an opportunity to be with our kids and grandkids, we do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">When my daughter was working and her husband was working, she sent her twins down for a summer and they spent the summer here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">And I'd take them, you know, for swimming lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">But that was a number of years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">They now just started <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">And we just figured we had better enjoy, enjoy the family when they still have time for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">Because, as I'm sure you know, Heather -- I don't know, you're an intern. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">Are you in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1150">QUESTION:  Actually, no, I'm a permanent staff member. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">A Oh, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">So -- but, you know, as you get more involved, whether it's with education or with jobs, you know, you don't have as much time for grandparents and families. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">So whenever we have a chance -- we're actually heading to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in October for the 100th anniversary for Hadassah.</span><span class="sentence" id="1155">All of us are -- my mother and my daughter and my daughter-in-law, my granddaughter and I are all life members. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And right after that, it turns out that it's grandparents day at my twins' <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and they just started <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">And so we're going right from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santa Cruz</span> so we can be there for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And we're also going up for Sukkot -- unfortunately, it's not as easy to get together for holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">All our children belong to <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> , which makes me very happy that they're involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">And what will happen with the next generation, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">But we took everyone to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> a couple of years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">Actually, it was five years ago in 2007. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">There were 14 of us that went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">So we feel it's very important, you know, for our family to know, know <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and to know the history of the Jews and to be proud of who they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1165">QUESTION:  Have you also been back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1166">ANSWER: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1167">QUESTION:  Or <span class="COUNTRY">Czech Republic</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1168">ANSWER: Yes, we have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">We've been back there a couple of times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">Not gone back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravska Ostrave</span> because I probably would not even remember where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">And also I've heard that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> is not a terrific <span class="NPIP">place</span> to visit now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">But I -- I don't know, we may still try to go back, but I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">But we've been to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and we've been to other <span class="NPIP">parts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> is a beautiful, beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">And, of course, you may know that Hitler had maintained a lot of the <span class="NPIP">places</span> there, supposedly as a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> to an extinct people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">So the <span class="BUILDING">Altneuschul</span> , which is the oldest <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and we went there for services -- is been in -- it has been in practice since 1200. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">Of course not during the Holocaust, but it's still there.</span><span class="sentence" id="1178">A wonderful <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">Have you ever been to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1180">QUESTION:  I have not, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1181">ANSWER:  Well, it's an absolutely, beautiful, beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">And a lot of Americans have gone there to work, young people, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">So we have -- I have -- both my husband and I have been back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1184">QUESTION:  I know you said you've also been back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> a lot, does that include <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kennington</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1185">ANSWER: Yes, we did go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kennington</span> and it really has changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">I did find the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we lived in and -- but it's become much more metropolitan. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">You know, more of a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> compared to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">country village</span> that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">It was really a real <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">You know, the people next door to us, you know, had sheep and chickens and Marge, their daughter, was my best friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">And, you know, we used to play together all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">So I'm sorry that I lost contact with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">One thing I try to do, I still have that -- you know, several friends that I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with at the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> that have visited me here and that I visited in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">So we -- you know, we've kept -- we're still in touch.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1194">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">Is there anything else that you want to touch on about anything that we've covered that you think is really important that you want to add that I haven't asked you about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1196">ANSWER:  No.</span><span class="sentence" id="1197">I think, not only have you asked me things, that I probably, you know, said more about things than you wanted to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">Actually, there was one little thing that I did mention to Ashley before, and that is a story of another cousin of my mother's who left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and tried to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> after <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had already invaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">And when she got to the <span class="DLF">border</span> with <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , she needed to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> her name was Celia Summerville -- well, no, it was Celia Mohrer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">She later married and her name became Celia Summerville and she was an artist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1201">QUESTION:  Can you spell her name for us?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1202">ANSWER:  Celia, C-E-L-I-A, and Mohrer was what she was at the time that she left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">She was a very young woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">M-O-H-R-E-R. And her parents were actually in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">And my mother helped -- they were older and my mother helped take care of them because they were like an aunt and uncle of hers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">But when Celia left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> at the <span class="DLF">border</span> , she needed to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and she got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">And the Nazis got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and cleared off all the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">And then she got back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and went into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">And from there she came to live with us for a while in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , then she moved into her own <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">But she then moved to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and married a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Summerville</span> and they lived right near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> on <span class="DLF">Cambridge Street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> , <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">And they had only one son, and he's -- he's a Ph.</span><span class="sentence" id="1212">D in epidemiology. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">And she -- he was working in <span class="REGION">New Mexico</span> , she moved there, we went to visit her, and then, you know, she passed away and he moved up to <span class="REGION">Alaska</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">And this summer, he called me and said he was getting married, and could we come up to this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Palmer</span> outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Alaska</span> so we went up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">So just wanted to mention that to show you how family is so important, that my husband and I dropped everything that we had planned and decided to go back up there and we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">And we went to the wedding and it was -- he was thrilled and his new wife was thrilled.</span><span class="sentence" id="1217">And we're very happy for him because now he has a whole family rather than being all alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">And one other thing I do want to mention, you know, I told you about our really tremendous loss. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">It was with me all the time, my oldest son. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">His son just got out of the IDF in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">He was in the Israeli army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">And that's another reason we're going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in October. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">Not only for the Hadassah's 100th anniversary, but also to see him and the rest of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">So that's something you didn't ask about maybe you wanted to know, but --
QUESTION:  No, we like details.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1225">ANSWER: But I just thought, you know, this -- the story of -- she was called Cilly, Celia.</span><span class="sentence" id="1226">It sounds -- C-I-L-L-Y. And she was wonderful young lady and I got to know her very well in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">We have some of her paintings, which were exhibited at the <span class="BUILDING">Fogg Museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">And, so, you know, it's just important to stay close to family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">I hope you have a good family and --
QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1230">ANSWER: -- realize how important they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1231">QUESTION:  So she was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> when the Nazis cleared the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1232">ANSWER: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1233">QUESTION:  Did she realize what was going on and --
ANSWER:  No.</span><span class="sentence" id="1234">She got back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and didn't realize until she realized that all the people that were traveling with her or near her were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">You know, and then from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> she came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and she stayed with us for a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">And then she, you know, moved into her own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and, you know, did different things, but --
QUESTION:  Did she know what happened to the Jews that were taken off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1237">ANSWER: No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1239">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1240">ANSWER: No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">I don't think there'd be any way, you know, of knowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">But -- and I can't even really tell you what exactly what year it was, because we were already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> when she came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">And she came through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">But, you know, this was another one of these stories, sort of like the one about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> we were supposed to be on that -- you know, it's just by chance that we're here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">And that's why it's so important to do the best that you can with your life as long as you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">Which sometimes isn't as long as you want, but, you try.</span></p>
