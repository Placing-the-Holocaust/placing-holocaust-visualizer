<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Niels Bamberger.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  And where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born in October 1928 in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And I was born, as an infant, my parents fled <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> 1n 1932, where my mother originally had come from. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And, uh, she lived in...1n <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for nine years, ten years. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Then she went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Why had she lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for ten years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  Because she got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">She grew up in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and then she married my father who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they were married in 1923 and then they went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> when it started to get...uh...with Hitler, and it started to get too hot in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Then they went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And that's where I actually grew up and lived half of my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Tell me about...what did your father do? </span><span class="sentence" id="15">What was his occupation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Well, in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> he had an <span class="BUILDING">antique store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">He had an <span class="BUILDING">art store</span> ; and they started that like in 1935-36 in Copenhagen, 'til we fled to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> in 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Tell me if you would about growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> before the Germans came, in the '30s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  I went to a non-Jewish school. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I was...I wouldn't say I was the only Jew in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but we were probably two or three fellows and the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was from 8 to 2 every day and then in the afternoon, we went for Hebrew...for Hebrew lessons or <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> for another two, three hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So we came back...we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> like 5:30, 6:00 every night and did our homework. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And that was the same routine. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Of course, we had no <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> Saturday or Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Then we were off and we went to football games and bicycling and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Whatever we did with my friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  What was your...your parents' <span class="BUILDING">home</span> like. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Did you practice...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Well, we had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> , in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">We had our own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that had belonged to my grandfather and great grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">It's still standing there now. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And it's probably two or three hundred years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And we had a big <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">There were other people living in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and then there were <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">There were <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And we had a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> that had been there for more than one hundred years also started by my great-grandfather on...in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we had that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  In the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And it's still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">It's not anymore there today because it was given to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Tell me how that worked? </span><span class="sentence" id="42">That is were you...you must have been heavily...your family was heavily involved in that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">We were very...I was brought up very Orthodox; and, of course, my parents were too. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">My grandfather was a Rabbi, and my brother is a Rabbi today. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So that's the way we grew up. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We...we had a very good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Like Tove said. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And uh...we had no problems whatsoever all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Not money-wise or economic or we had no problem until it started in October '43, and the Germans had been in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> for three years from '40 to '43.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  Hold it for one minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Before we get to the Germans, I would like to know a little more about your being Jewish in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And you were so closely involved in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">What...what did your Jewish life consist of? </span><span class="sentence" id="55">What kinds of things did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Holidays, services, what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  We had services every day in our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And, of course, we had the sabbath, the Jewish Sabbath every week, and we had the Jewish holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And uh...the reason our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was started originally of...by my great grandfather or grandfather was that he didn't think that the big <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> --they have a beautiful, large <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen--</span> but that wasn't Orthodox enough hundred years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">They started with, uh...different reformed things; and they cut this prayer out and they cut this one out. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And that's when my grandfather started his own <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And like I said, it still...it still can be seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">It's in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> ...the city. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">You see them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">They have...they removed everything when the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was sold a couple of years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">It...like I said, it's a very old <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and it's in the heart of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And there was no money to pay the taxes and the <span class="DLF">roof</span> was falling apart so to speak and...uh...then it was sold. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was sold, and the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was removed. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And that's the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Today, it's just an old, uh...<span class="BUILDING">landmark building</span> in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> that's being owned by a private man or corporation. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I don't know who has it today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Uh, in growing up in such a very...in a <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox Jewish home</span> , did you feel differently? </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Did you feel you were treated differently than your Christian neighbors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">They were my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And, uh...we went together for this or for that and we had birthday parties and we went to ball games and things like that, I said before. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And, uh...there was no difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Nobody ever mentioned anything about Jewish or non-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We were all the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We were citizens of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and that's all they cared about. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Nobody said you are Jewish or you are not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">That made no difference to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  When the Germans invaded in 1940, you would have been 12 years old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  Uh, what can you tell me about, uh...the invasion itself? </span><span class="sentence" id="86">What do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  Well, we know that, uh, there were soldiers all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And they threw out leaflets all over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that people could just go now and don't make any uproar. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Everything will continue the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Of course, everything became rationed or rationed whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And...uh... we were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">We saw loads and loads of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , bombing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> coming one after...I mean hundreds and hundreds of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> coming in and Germans on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> , horses, dragging cannons and the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">It didn't take more than a couple of hours ‘til they took over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Like I said they [the Danes] couldn't resist. </span><span class="sentence" id="95"><span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> was a very small <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And, uh...life went on as before, except that that you are not allowed to walk on this side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> in front of the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They would post soldiers with, uh...guns and...and steel helmets and things like that in front of the <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> and important institutions that they wanted to guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">But besides that nothing happened really. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">The police was in force and the Danish Army was...although they were there, they had not much to say or to do, but they were all...life was continuing the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Everything got rationed and we had to buy butter and bread and gasoline, all the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">You couldn't go out and buy whatever you wanted, but there was plenty of it around. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">The Germans took away whatever they needed, but there was still plenty. </span><span class="sentence" id="103"><span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> is a dairy country, so there was plenty of food for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And then in...uh...1in 1943, they took the...they arrested all the police and the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">They took them away in August of '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">That's when we know...knew something was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">They took them away and interned them all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and took their weapons away and then they said that 1t was the police's fault and the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Then all of a sudden they switched over and they said that it's all the Jews' fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I mean they didn't say it, but we knew that something was going to happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  How? </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Tell me what your life had been like in those three years and then we will continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  The same thing like before. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">We went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">We had food. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">We had all holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And...uh...we went to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> , went to regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">There was no difference so to speak except that...uh...we saw the Germans all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And...uh...everybody despised them. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">They still do today. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">When the Germans go to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> with their big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and so on, nobody likes them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">But otherwise, everything continued the way it had been til '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I think it was August '43 that...uh...they took, the Germans...they took the police force and the soldiers and interned everybody and...uh... August...and October Ist, I believe it was Rosh Hashanah, they had been in to pick up the...all the files from the Jewish... uh...community. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">They had all the names, all the addresses of everyone in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> , which was about 6,000 Jews and they had.... They knew where they lived, what they did, their business. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">They had everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And we were informed in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on Rosh Hashanah, the first day of Rosh Hashanah, we were informed that nobody should go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because the Germans are going to round you up the night between the Ist and the 2nd of October. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And those who believed it, which most of the people did, we were all scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">They...uh...didn't go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We all had made arrangements with some non-Jews, some Danish where we could stay or where to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Those who didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">They were taken, which was a very small percentage anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And they all came back after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So we went to our grocer who was a bachelor and he said, "Come to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I'll take care of you." </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So after the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , we went to him and he bought us, or he had in his <span class="BUILDING">store</span> bread and butter and cheese and milk and eggs, whatever we needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">He took care of us for a week til we found a connection how to get out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> 1s on the <span class="DLF">seashore</span> and we went up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Snekkersten</span> , same <span class="NPIP">place</span> and where most of them went from. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Everybody went to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> from there because it's the narrowest point between <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">It's like three, four miles wide. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">That's the whole thing...the <span class="DLF">waterway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">But it is very heavy stream there. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">It's a very heavy...uh... <span class="DLF">waterway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So we stayed in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and....
QUESTION:  In whose.... Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">How...first of all, how did you get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Snekkersten</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  How did we get there? </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Well, he called up every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">He called up somebody that he knew from the resistance movement and he didn't say...we went with...I went with my parents and my two brothers and a sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">We were six people altogether. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And he wouldn't say that he has some people to send. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">He didn't know if this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span> was...uh...what do you call it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  Tapped?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  Tapped!</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  This is your grocer calling?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So he called up. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">He said, "I have six tons of potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Could you come and pick them up?" '</span><span class="sentence" id="156">Til he finally got a connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And uh...it took us about a week, until the day before Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And then we got a tax1; and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> took us up to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Snekkersten</span> , where everybody had been collected, so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">All the people were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">There were two or three hundred people there everyday, four hundred people maybe in somebody's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , in a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And I remember as a child that...uh...we were covered up in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> with...uh...a blanket in case the police would stop and say, "What's wrong? </span><span class="sentence" id="162">What do you have in there?" </span><span class="sentence" id="163">He would say, "I have a sick person. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Just close the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I have to go to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So we were covered up and he went up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">It's not more than 30, 40 minute ride by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">We went up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">We came to that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And...uh...we met somebody from the resistance movement who took us down to the <span class="DLF">pier</span> at night, and we came down there and we were told that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> we were supposed to go with had been taken by somebody else who paid more money for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">He paid a big sum of money, so he took this man out by himself...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">So we had to wait til the next day and...uh...the next day, luckily for us it had been organized this way that the resistance movement had a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">schooner</span> -like; and they took two or three hundred people aboard. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">We went all down...down below <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> , and uh...we went out there by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">row boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">It wasn't far out to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and when they had all the people there, first we paid them money. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">We paid like 2,000 krone a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">That was the going rate. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Which was a lot of money at that time; but we were told if you come to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> the money 1s worthless. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">You can't do anything with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">You might as well leave it here, number 1, and number 2, whatever money you give now will help those people who are poor or sick and can't afford it. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">They will also get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Everybody got out, whether they had money or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">They were all helped to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And we got aboard that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and, uh... we got off. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">We sailed also...uh...for an hour or so at midnight and in the middle of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> we had this big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Swedish torpedo boat</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gunboat</span> coming towards us. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">We all thought it was the Germans, but it was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Swedish boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">They had the same kind of uniforms and they helped us all off, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Swedish ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">We got aboard the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Swedish ship</span> and they gave us coffee and candy or whatever, and then we went into <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And we were saved.

There was no fighting when we came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">What they needed them for was to clean up after the Germans, and take the weapons away and count this and count that. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And the uniforms...whatever they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">My father was too old, and I was too young, so to speak; so they didn't take me.</span></p>
