<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  Would you elaborate on what happened to your family once the military operations -- to you, of course, once the military operations against Soviet Union started?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Once the war started against the Russians, they Jews in our <span class="NPIP">place</span> were considered like spies. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Now, we were not to -- we were not allowed to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">We were not allowed to travel too much from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">locality</span> to another, except with a permit from the gendarmerie. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">We also experienced a tremendous amount of anti-Semitism; it started. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">The Germans also went through with their army to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucovina</span> to the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And right after the Germans attacked, there was an order that came down to us that we are going to be evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">We did not know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">It was on a Thursday morning that we knew that we are going to evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">The following day, Friday morning, the army came in with their machine guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Surrounded us, and we were given the order to go to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">There they had lined up already <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , and as a family -- I think it was the middle of September that we were evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">With as much as you can carry, we didn't have too many things because they did not allow us to take a lot of things with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So we were dumped then into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> , about 60, 70 people with the little bit of belongings that you could take. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And when we left on that Friday morning, we did not know where we were going, except in passing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , that you recognized the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bessarabia</span> , and we were asked to disembark in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hataki</span> (ph) . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">That was the place next to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Dniester</span> , to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Dniester</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  That was the crossing point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  It was the <span class="DLF">crossing point</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hataki</span> , you could see from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hataki</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mogilev</span> , the <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And on that <span class="DLF">hill</span> , you saw thousands and thousands of people going up that <span class="DLF">hill</span> , like a continuous convoy going up that <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hataki</span> itself, 1t was raining. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">It was -- the mud was impossible to -- if you put a foot down, you couldn't drag it out from the mud. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And you were standing there in the rain for about a day and a night, until they had only two of these <span class="DLF">pontoon bridges</span> that could take about, let's say, maybe 100, 150 people across to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hataki</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Because a lot of people were -- died. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I myself bearing the , | don't know until today who he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">He grabbed me to dig the <span class="DLF">grave</span> , and today, the person was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">There was robberies going on because on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , when we came over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mogilev</span> , you had already Ukrainians there, which were very, very much anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And there were robberies going on and killings and beatings and shootings, so we thought we cannot stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We would like to go further, and that's why when we came over, one of our family, one of my uncles, knew that -- he has a local permit, so he went to the Romanian Kommandanturen, and he was asking for a permit to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">The day after he leave -- we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">We had to be dependent on them to let us know where we are going. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And so they gave us a permit to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Moldova</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So we were about 150 people that formed a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Moldova</span> , and we were escorted by two soldiers, two Romanian soldiers, which took us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">The trip lasted about two days and two nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Moldova</span> , he says this is the locality. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">It was a small, small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> which was occupied by Ukrainian Jews and also Gentiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But the inner of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto,</span> and that's where they chased the Jews and that's where they put us in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Let me ask you something, please. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">The Jews, the local Jews, are these Ukrainian Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morava</span> or local Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morava</span> or Jews deported from other places of the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morava</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  No, those were the Jews living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morava</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">They all wore the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">They put on yellow stars on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And they were not allowed -- we were not allowed to walk out from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">They never gave you permits to walk away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and we settled in there with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Life was really -- was peculiar. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">You didn't know the beginning that is going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">They wouldn't let you work. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">You had to eat, so you started to sell whatever you had from your possessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">You started to sell. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I was -- there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">The Jews, the local Jews, had some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">They had some money left over, their gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We came with what we could grab in the last minute, so we did not have any rubles or any currency that was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We only had Romanian drays and we had some gold, some -- we had a few diamonds. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We had some watches, which slowly, slowly we started to sell and to be able to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  Before I ask you finally to describe to us the day-to-day life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morava</span> , I would like you to go back for one second to the crossing of the <span class="RIVER">Dniester</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Because, if my understanding 1s correct, you witnessed also the Bessarabian Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Enest</span> (ph) where. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">We witnessed -- we witnessed Bessarabian Jews and people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mogilev</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">We were there and we were right next to the Dniester. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And in one evening, they came in with their valiants, with horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">They chased them from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Those Jews, it was a tragedy. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">We still had something to wear, but they did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">They were, I would say, three-quarters naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Rags. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And the soldiers were beating them, . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">The children were put out because they could not take the children, so they left them with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I mean they left them with the people that were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Said, "Please take care of my child." </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Three-year-old, four years, five- year-old children which couldn't go any further. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">It was a frightening situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">At that time we thought that in case we can get a permit, we'd be able to walk away and not being chased like they were chased ,
QUESTION:  Let's return to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morava</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And I am kindly asking you to describe for us what was the daily life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morava</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I mean what were your relations as deportees with the local authorities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  Well, the local authorities were the Ukrainians. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Many of us were Ukrainian. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We also had, on our part, we had a Jewish organization . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So when they needed something, they asked the organization to provide it. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Like, for instance, during the springtime, they were asking for people to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And the Germans were providing a list that they needed 500 to 1,000, 1,500 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So they came and they said that from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morava</span> , they needed to send 500 young boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">As it were, we had to provide those 500 young boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So it was a very hard thing for the Jewish community to go around and say, "Look, you have a boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I want him to go to work." </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Which we did not know if they are going to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Because they took us all the way down to the <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">The was at that time in , and they're and . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">During the springtime, it was not so bad because it was not cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">But in the wintertime, when you have to be there, I mean three-quarters of the people died from hunger and from starvation and from cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">That was during the springtime. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And at the end of the summer, they sent whoever remained, whoever was not sick, came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">During the wintertime, they took us out and cleaned the <span class="DLF">roads</span> , so that the <span class="DLF">roads</span> could be opened for the Germans to bring their supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">At one time, we were taken out to , It was a little place where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> was passing. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">They had a lot of activities with there, so they had to cut the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , around the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So they cut up the -- they cut the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> out for about 100 or 200 feet away from the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> , so they should be able to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">This is the type of work that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And cleaning the <span class="DLF">roads</span> , which I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I worked from early in the morning till late at night with one piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And I have seen with my own eyes like people were just standing there, and within a minute you saw them falling down and being stiff, because it was -- the temperature was 20, 25 below zero. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So I was just lucky, I had some good clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And then I was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Just young, that 1s good to do -- do whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">When I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the depression had set in. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I had seen so many people that did not come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and they would always ask me, "Did you see this boy? </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Did you see that boy?" </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And I knew that he is dead, but how can you say that to somebody? </span><span class="sentence" id="131">That maybe they took him away and he's going to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But it was a frightening situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">The life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> proper was a -- you were living with hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I personally am an optimist. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">With every day that passed, I said maybe God will help. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Maybe something will come of it, and maybe somehow we will escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">But during the wintertime, we suffered tremendously because during the wintertime, you had the sickness. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Typhoid fever with spots, that was tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">It took about two weeks if a person got sick with that sickness. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Which I was sick with it, I was sick for two weeks with about 104 temperature, 105. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And then there was like a crisis, and if you remained alive, a lot of people developed all kinds of sicknesses with their eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Even I have a complication of the inflammation of the veins on both legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And I was sick for about six weeks during the wintertime after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And thank God I escaped and I came through. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Doctors didn't have any medications. "</span><span class="sentence" id="146">The only medication," he says, "I could give you is pray. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Pray to God. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I have nothing to give you. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">If you are strong, if you have a strong heart, you'll be able to live." </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And that advice, what can I tell you? </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Thank God I came through it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  How many people do you estimate were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morava</span> , local Jews and Romanian Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  Local Jews and Romanian Jews together, we have about -- I would say about 2,500.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  From which -- how many Romanian Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  The Moravian Jews were about 1,500, and we were about 1,000, maybe more. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We were mixed up, we were partly from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We had quite a few people, we have some people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sojava</span> (ph) . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We had some people from . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And that was about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  Can you think about any other dramatic or particular incidents that you witnessed in the ghetto of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morava</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  The particular incident that I witnessed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morava</span> , I mean that always comes to life in me was two incidents. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">One, that you were taken one time out to work on the <span class="DLF">tobacco fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">They had a lot of tobacco. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And there they lined us up, and we were all young kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">There they lined us up after work, and they beat us. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Gave us a tremendous beating.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  Who beat you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  The Ukrainians. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">We could not go to complain to the Romanians, because if we will complain, then the authorities, the Ukrainian authorities, which were very anti-Semitic, would kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So we didn't say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">We took the beating, and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And that went on for days. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Every day, every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Another bad incident that I came through was they asked us one day to bring our bulletins. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">You know, we had identification cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">To bring the bulletins into the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Anybody that is not bringing in, is not coming in with a bulletin to be signed by the authorities will be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So I said, "I have to go." </span><span class="sentence" id="179">My mother was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">She said, "Don't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Whatever will happen will happen." </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I said, "Look, I must go." </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So I went, that was late in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And as soon as they got them, about 500, 600 people they made a circle to their soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">That was the Romanians, and they beat them. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">They hit us with daggers. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Then they sent us down to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mogilev</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">When we came there, there was about 2,500 people gathered together from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jelenia</span> (ph) , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shagala</span> (ph), from whatever <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , whatever they had there. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And they were going to send us away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gruenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gruenwald</span> , to send us away to the Germans, specifically to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nikolayev</span> to build a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And we knew that any person that went there from before never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So what I did is plainly, we were all sitting in a <span class="DLF">yard</span> surrounded by <span class="DLF">fences</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Somehow my luck was that I saw an <span class="DLF">opening</span> in the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , and I jumped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mogilev</span> , but they didn't know -- they didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">They did not have any notification that I left when I came. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And that was the only thing that saved me. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I had cousins, I had an uncle that went there, did not come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">They never came. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Because you had to -- with the type of food that they gave you, you got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And after you got sick, the Germans shot you because they were very much afraid of having sick people, they feed their soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And that was the end of that little incident.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  How long did you stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transnistria</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  In all we stayed from 1941 to 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">In 1944 the Russians liberated us. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">They went through, there was about two days and a night, there was fights between the Russians and the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And then you saw the Germans pulling back. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I think we were lucky that the Germans pulled back, we could not -- they could not handle the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Because at the end of the German pullback, the SS always went and they always destroyed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Somehow weird, it seems to me, that the Russians were too powerful and they chased them too fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And they couldn't stop, and they didn't have any time to go around at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">When I saw the first Russian in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , I didn't recognize that it's a Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I just thought he was from the partisans that were fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">They came in so fast, and there was machine gun fire that we sat all in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">That we were just lucky that it just happened, and they liberated us. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">After the liberation, the Russians came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">They formed an <span class="BUILDING">army barracks</span> , and said to us that we should come there to be examined. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Because they wanted to take us and to sent us back to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to -- I would say an amount of military exercise. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And they put us back in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">So, but we formed right away detachments of boys and girls, and they left the <span class="REGION">localities</span> , going towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mogilev</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And from there, we came to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car train</span> that was also the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Then we came back to . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">| came back, from I weighed, I lost maybe half the amount of weight. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I came back I weighed maybe 70 pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">QUESTION:  Then you stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> or did you go back to ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">ANSWER:  We stayed -- I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> about eight days, and I experienced in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> a gathering by the Russians, which they grabbed young kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And they sent them away to the <span class="REGION">hinterland</span> because they wanted to train us to be soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">They sent us to the <span class="REGION">Polish front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">But I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I was not that old, I didn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">We left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , and we followed the front to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mehalin</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="231"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mehalin</span> is close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sirets</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="232">There's a Gibba (ph) Sirets, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">It's about 45 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> , and there we went already over to the <span class="REGION">Romanian side</span> , where the Romanian authorities were in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So there I was waiting for my parents to come, because they came about four or five weeks later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  Did already the Romanians switch sides at this moment or not yet?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">ANSWER:  The Romanians switched sides, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">The Romanians formed a different government. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">They switched sides, and we could not go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because the front was in retreat. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So as soon as we heard that a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">locality</span> was liberated, we went a little bit closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Until I came back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> that was in 1944 on Rosh Hashanah. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">There was nobody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">It was a deserted <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">There was a few people living with the rest of the people from over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
