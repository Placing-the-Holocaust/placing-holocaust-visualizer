ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">And tell me something about your family and your background.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  Mother and father, father was a newspaper reporter in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> , transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and became sports editor of the New York World Telegram. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I have a brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My mother and father divorced and saw very little of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And -- but my mother, I think was loyal to him all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">The one thing that I remember about him, when I wanted to become a nurse, he said to my mother, “There’s not going to be any damn maids in our family.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  That’s what he thought of nursing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Well, in those days -- you’re thinking -- talking 1939 -- is when I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">So my mother said I could go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and become a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Well, I didn’t want to become a teacher, I wanted to become a nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">So I stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for a whole year and did absolutely nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And she finally said to me, “Go, go,” you know. “</span><span class="sentence" id="14">T’ll pay for it,” because in those days you had to pay for a nursing education. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And it was Dad’s responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">So, anyhow, make a long story short, I became a nurse and he never congratulated me or anything, until I got in the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And he wrote me a letter that he wanted to come down and do an article on the nurses, the army nurses. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And by the time I July 15, 1995 got the letter, we were all -- already overseas, living 1n <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">In fact it was [indecipherable] who helped me compose a letter back to my father saying, “You wouldn’t want to do a story on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">We don't look like nurses, we don’t act like nurses. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">We’re,” you know, “we’re living in <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> and,” you know, “walking in mud and not the sterile atmosphere that you think, the white, crisp nurses.” </span><span class="sentence" id="22">So he dropped the subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">He never said boo to me a -- the rest of my life -- or his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And --
QUESTION:  Where did you get the idea that you wanted to be a nurse and why was it such a strong motivation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  Well, actually, it goes back to -- I was five and a half years old, had a real bad operation and I al-almost died, evidently. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">It was rare in that time -- and I won’t go into it, because, well -- but anyhow, two holes in my belly here. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And I can alway -- and I had specials around the clock and I can always remember, you know, begging my -- my nurses to, “Oh, I'd give you a drink if you were thirsty,” you know, and -- cause I couldn’t have any water, anything to drink and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And that must have been what was instilled in me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  You remembered that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Cause I had no idea what nursing was like when I went into training. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">In fact, my mother, when she finally said go, she said, “I give you a couple of months and you’ll be back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And I said, “No, I won’t, I'll stick it out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  Well, where did you get the idea that you wanted to go in the service?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Well, that -- that’s almost another s -- chapter in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I had my boyfriend through <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> was -- had gone in the service before he was drafted, so -- and he and -- July 15, 1995 volunteered for the airborne. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">He was in the 82nd Airborne Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And in training we weren’t allowed to be married. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And we had been really romantic and he knew he was going overseas and so he got leave and I sneaked out and we got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Well, his -- his family knew about it and my family knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">It was a real simple ceremony and we just had a weekend pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And that was the last I saw of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">He went o -- he was in the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Sicily</span> and he was mi -- th-that’s a thorn in my side, he was considered an MIA for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Then he -- they you’re dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Not like the MIA’s today that they’re still -- you know, I know that they have to look for these people, but they didn’t look for the boys in the World War Two. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And there were many of them that they never found. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And unless there’s blue eyed blondes running around <span class="COUNTRY">Sicily</span> , then I don’t know where he 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And -- so I went trying to find some trace of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I’d written to his chaplain and I’d written to a lieutenant that used to censor our letters and never got any response. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Went to the Red Cross, never got any response. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So, I finally found -- when I was in the service, and I was stationed down <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlantic City</span> in what they called <span class="BUILDING">England General Hospital</span> -- it was one of the big <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlantic City</span> at the time, they made a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And I found a -- a fellow that was in his company. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And so he invited me over to his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with his wife and we got talking and he knew that my -- my Hughie had jumped, and he -- cause I wondered, you know, did he even make it over there? </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And he said, “Yeah,” he said, “but that was a” -- I guess that whole operation was a faux pas, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">They went off of target and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So anyhow, at least I knew that he did his duty, [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  What was his name? </span><span class="sentence" id="57">July 15, 1995
ANSWER:  Hugh Sheridan. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And that’s why they call me Sherry. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">My maiden name was Williams. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So at least I found that out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  When did you find that out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  Well, actually it was a year that they -- well no, 1t wasn’t a year, because they had listed him as missing in action and his pap -- picture was in the paper and a | -- his -- his family had given this little blurb that -- you know, he’d just gotten married, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And I knew my directress of nurses would see this paper, cause it was a local paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">By this time I’m out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but I felt so bad, cause I had lied to her, you know, to get this little pass that I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So I went back to her and, you know, in a teary eyed, nice, you know, “Miss Copeland, I want to talk to you and --” so I started to say something, she said, “I know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="66">She said, “I know you got married.” </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And I looked at her and -- but she didn’t know, you know, that he had been missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So she was sorry about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">But it was okay and I guess she probably felt good that I came back to confess my crime or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">But -- you see, we were Catholic and -- and the banns had to be announced in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and they were announced in his <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , where -- where she went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  Oh, so she knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  And she picked up the n -- the names and she must have even known who was writing to me, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Cause they knew everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So that’s --
QUESTION:  So he was lost in --
ANSWER: <span class="COUNTRY"> Sicily</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  June *44? </span><span class="sentence" id="76">July 15, 1995
ANSWER:  Actually, July.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  July.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  July ‘43.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  And I got out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> probably September ‘43. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And by the time you took state boards and, you know, to get your RN, cause you couldn’t join the service until you got your state boards and had physical, papers, it was ‘44. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">It was early ‘44 that I went in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  And was stationed down <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlantic City</span> for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And then got my orders to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Polk</span> where the 131st was being started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">The full name of your unit was what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  131st <span class="BUILDING">evacuation hospital</span> , semi-mobile. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">In other words, you could pick up half of that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and move it on, while the other half was still operating, although we never did that, but it was equipped to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">You could even take down half of the <span class="INT_SPACE">operating room</span> , which was a huge, big <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Look -- it was several <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> put together. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Looked like a big <span class="BUILDING">circus tent</span> , almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And you could take down half of that and move it on and move half of the <span class="INT_SPACE">wards</span> on. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And we had two teams, you know, nurses and doctors and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">But we never did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">We - we all -- when we set up -- set up as a whole and moved the whole unit as a whole, so --

QUESTION:  A <span class="BUILDING">mobile hospital</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  Yeah, mo-mobile army surgical hospital. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And I imagine today that that’s what they call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">| don’t think they call it <span class="BUILDING">evacuation hospitals</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">The patients that we had stayed maybe -- maybe two nights at the most and then they were either taken by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> or air evac-ed out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  So this was 1944 they were forming this unit at Fort --

<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  Well, it -- we headed up north in December, early December and by this time we knew that we were heading someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">We had gotten a leave to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and it was a short leave, probably 10 days and then we would up at -- and I don’t remember whether it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Kilmer</span> , someplace in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And we did a lot of training, as far as marching with packs on our backs and --
QUESTION:  What el -- what other kind of training? </span><span class="sentence" id="118">July 15, 1995
ANSWER:  Well, well I think we did that down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Jackson</span> , we dug fli -- <span class="DLF">trenches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">We put up <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> and we hiked and I was -- I think I told you about the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> that we went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And then we --
QUESTION:  Tell me about that again, on tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  Well, it was this -- almost about the -- the length of a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , maybe shorter, but there was nothing in it but tear gas.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Underground, or it was --
ANSWER:  No, no up -- up above. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">It was all sealed, full of tear gas and there was a sergeant or some GI sitting at the end with a pad of paper and a pencil and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and you went into the far end and walked through this whole <span class="INT_SPACE">chamber</span> of gas, with a gas mask on. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">You always had to have your gas mask on and you had to put it on properly, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Cause if it wasn’t properly fit then you got the gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">When you reached this officer -- enlisted man, whatever he was, took off your gas mask and told him your name, rank and your serial number. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And if you got nervous and flubbed -- cause he must have had it right down there what your s-serial number was, if you missed a number, he’d say, “Repeat that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="128">You know, and -- but it was one way to teach us all our serial number, because that was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And then you -- you got out into the fresh air and then --
QUESTION:  Oh, where he was sitting -- he had a gas mask on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  Oh, he had it on too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  Oh, was a gas -- July 15, 1995
ANSWER:  Oh yeah, he wa -- he was sitting in there with his mask on, but you would take yours off. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And he was just delighting in every, you know, especially with a bunch of females you know and we were all screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And -- I imagine -- I know the men had to go through this too, probably even harder. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And --
QUESTION:  And -- and you had to dig <span class="DLF">trenches</span> and --
ANSWER:  We -- we dug a slit tr -- well, what they call a <span class="DLF">slit trench</span> , which would just hold a -- a body, you know, in case you got bombed, you could jump into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And we put our <span class="BUILDING">pup tents</span> up. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And those were small <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> , they were like two men tents. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And as I remember, each one of us carried a half a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> at all times. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So if you were ever caught someplace with no shelter, you could double up and -- and -- and put some s -- kind of a shelter up. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">All those things I think are in the bottom of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Atlantic Ocean</span> , cause when we came back, stuff was going over the side.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Oh, really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Well, you didn’t want to -- hey, you didn’t want to carry this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Hopefully you wouldn’t need it again, but --
QUESTION:  Did they teach you how to use a weapon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  No, no --
QUESTION:  Never?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  No, never --
QUESTION:  Never had to use it? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">July 15, 1995
ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">We were given all sorts of films on disease, body lice, sanitary conditions, and I don’t even think there was a film for us on weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And there were no weapons in our <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , although I do have a picture of our dental assistant and he’s got a bandoleer of, you know, shells on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I don’t know where he got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But --
QUESTION:  And did they -- did you have special training in how to treat combat wounds?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  Well, that was -- in the army you do everything, as they say, by the AR’s -- Army regulations. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">There was only one way to dress a wound and you did it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">You might not like to do it that way, but the army wanted you to do it that way, so yes, we had -- had all these army regulations on how to treat this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And going over on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , I was assigned to -- to be an orthopedic surgical nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And I met the orthopedic surgeon and he gave me a whole list of what we would do for all these orthopedic -- amputations or whatever, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And you read them and okay, we’ll do what we have to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  Were they substantially different from the way you had learned in <span class="BUILDING">nursing school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  No, no, but -- no, not really, you know, the -- you -- you still had a surgical technique that you had to follow. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But they had a particular way of doing things and the army is a stickler for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Y-Y -- In the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> you might have several different sizes of bandages, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">In the army, you have one or two sizes. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I do -- it may be different now, but 1-in wartime it wasn’t anyhow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  While we were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , I saw returning casualties from the Battle of the Bulge. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">For bandages they used the latest issue of “Stars and Stripes’, which was the magazine. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">They July 15, 1995 had no bandages. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And we’d get them in the <span class="INT_SPACE">operating room</span> and we’d have to wet down this leg that was -- had all this paper -- newspaper stuck to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Cause that’s the only thing they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Cause that was a different situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So you can’t say that they went by army regulations. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">You do what you have to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  Mm. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Mm. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Let’s pick up our chronology. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">You had to leave in December, you went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  We went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for a short leave and I can remember my mother gave me a Hagen Hague bottle of Scotch, pinch bottle and I hate Scotch. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And so we got back to base --
QUESTION:  Why did she give you Scotch?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">She -- it wa -- evidently this was a very -- and 1s -- I don’t know, cause I’m not a Scotch -- it’s a very good brand of Scotch. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And she said, “Take this back, you know, they might want to have a little party or something.” </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And when we got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , the <span class="DLF">door</span> came down and you could not make a phone call, you could not write a letter, you could not have any visitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">It was -- and I’m trying to think of the name they used. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I want to say black out, but it wasn’t -- was the censo-censorship. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So my mother never heard from me and she’s saying, “Oh, Louise got caught with that bottle of -- 1n her --” She said they put her on -- you know, put her in the brig or something, cause I got -- and I went in -- I can remember going in to the little <span class="BUILDING">commissary</span> there and they had a fl -- a florist in there that you -- they could wire flowers out. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Pll fix -- Pll get in touch with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So I wired her a dozen red roses. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Course she got them a month later, but I thought they would go right out, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">But they were smart, you know, and just all I put on 1s, “I love you”, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And -- it didn’t work. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">July 15, 1995
QUESTION:  And you -- and you shipped out

<p><span class="sentence" id="425">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Yes, I did, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Wondered, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="428">He used to have a -- on his dogtags he had a little vial with my hair in it and he had said to me the last I saw him, he said, “Don’t ever believe I’m dead unless you get this back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And course, I’ve never gotten it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">But there were -- I’ve heard so many stories since, how -- must have been an awful job for these -- I don’t know what they call them, they had a name -- that buried the dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And this especially, in the Battle of Normandy, I heard this from one of the GIs, the -- the -- the -- the invasion of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> was so horrendous, that they had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> of left arms and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> of right arms and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> of left legs and when they went to bury a body, if it was missing a left leg, they went to that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">So, you wonder. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And even when I was in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , my July 15, 1995 chemistry teacher in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> was a doctor, a female doctor and she was a doctor in World War One. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And she had all these slides to show us. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">They were slides of heart tissue and lung tissue and all sorts of tissues that she had taken out of World War One dead soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And she told us then -- and here we are, that’s way back in the young -- late -- early 30’s, that they stuffed them with straw and sent them <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to be buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So you wonder, you know, what came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Maybe he’s better over there, not knowing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Blown to bits or something, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">But that stuck and I -- I -- I can always remem -- I can remember we had these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> in -- in hi -- in -- in -- in our chemistry lab that were two to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> , and I w -- I -- listening like this and all of a sudden I hear bump and the girl next to me fainted right out on -- of her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">But I don’t know if they could do that now. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Maybe they do, I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">QUESTION:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">So you were caring for e -- wounded soldiers and grieving at the same time, or --
ANSWER:  I couldn’t have been grieving. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">As -- now this 1s a -- a year later, for one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I was busy doing my work. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I thought of him, I <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> -- I still have the same picture I carried with him -- with his wings, and the last letter I wrote him, or he wrote me, excuse me, which was a V- mail letter, but they never photographed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And I am curious to know why it was never photographed, because they came all photographed, I don’t know if you’re familiar with the- well, V -- V mail, you would write on this certain paper, you could only have one sheet and they would photograph and put them into microfilm. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And then they sent that microfilm. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">They’d get thousands and thousands of letters on this little spool of microfilm. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And that July 15, 1995 saved hundreds of cubic feet in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo ship</span> , sending all these letters back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">This letter, dated July, it looks like seven, but he made it an eight and he was missing on the 10th. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And it says, “I’m going to be busy for awhi -- this’Il probably be the last letter you get from me, cause I’m going to by busy, but you’!l hear about it soon enough.” </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And that -- why would they sent that handwritten, you know, piece, the original piece. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">So I still have that and his picture, which I carried all overseas with me and kept even when I remarried and my husband knew it was in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> and it stayed there and it’s still there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="637">ANSWER:  And there again, it’s survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">A sense of survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Just like the poor inmates in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Why did this one live and thousands other die? </span><span class="sentence" id="641">They had a survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And I’m sure a lot of them must have had a guilty complex going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Especially if their whole family died. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">July 15, 1995 Why did he live? </span><span class="sentence" id="645">That’s -- you know, I would -- I would have no idea what that feeling is like, but I imagine there must be a lot that -- that have that feeling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">QUESTION:  So you would -- you would have your <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> and then they would come and get you and you would go down to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> would always take -- we couldn’t walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">We were in -- supposed to be walking <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="REGION">areas</span> , because you didn’t know what was out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> would bring us down to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we would work and eat and they would take us back to <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> and we stayed there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">QUESTION:  And the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">ANSWER:  Was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Gusen</span> , which was a satellite of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> was up on the <span class="DLF">hill</span> and they brought down -- well, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gusen</span> enough -- had enough of it’s own patients, but some of the patients from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , because there was no medical facilities up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And our <span class="INT_SPACE">wards</span> were set up, they must have told you, in former <span class="BUILDING">SS barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="654">But we used the same -- I guess you’d call it the same three tiered <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , for the inmates, except there was only one in each <span class="INT_SPACE">bunk</span> instead of three or four. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> of straw, because I, you know, I never questioned, when I was there, where’d all these blankets come from? </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Or where’d these pajamas come from? </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And evidently they must have flown them in and it wasn’t -- this Mike Wordell, who I’d wanted to come, he told me -- and I didn’t realize it at the time, there were two units that were sent in, which were called delousing units. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">That’s all they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And they were behind the <span class="DLF">walls</span> , delou -- cause these guys all -- pa -- inmates, July 15, 1995 patients, whatever you want to call them, had to be completely deloused before they were brought out to us.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="661">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, before we arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And then -- and while we were there, because as we would have, say eight deaths a night, we’d have eight -- eight empty <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , they’d bring out - but they were -- they were doing this behind the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Washing them down and delousing them and giving them either a blanket or pajamas, whatever was flown in. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And I didn’t know about that, I didn’t even question, “Where 1s this all coming?” </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I should have said, “How come?” </span><span class="sentence" id="666">You know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="667">QUESTION:  And what did you do then, you would come every day into the same <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">ANSWER:  We’d come in -- into the same ward, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="669">QUESTION:  And how many people were -- would be in there, do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">ANSWER:  I would say at least 100, but I am not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">120 - 140, I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="672"><span class="INT_SPACE">Rooms</span> on both sides and they were big, big <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And --
QUESTION:  And a <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> in the middle?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="674">ANSWER:  Big <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> and open <span class="DLF">door</span> here and an open <span class="DLF">door</span> at the other end, so that you could -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> itself was very dark, but you could see light at the end of the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And I -- I like to think of that, yes there is a light at the end of the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="676">One of -- and I think I told you that we were not allowed to have any physical contact with the patients. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">We could not -- inmates, whatever you want to call them. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">We were not allowed to give them nursing care. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">They brought in either prisoners of war -- German prisoners of war or people from the July 15, 1995 community. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Went out in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and rounded them up and they stayed there for the day, fed, washed and cleaned. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">These guys did what they could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">QUESTION:  So you didn’t touch them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">ANSWER:  We didn’t touch them. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">We weren’t allowed to touch them. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">The only thing we did was give them medication.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">QUESTION:  Every day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">ANSWER:  Every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Those that needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">We learned the word diarrhea in three languages and I’m not sure that I can even say the -- the names today and I’m sure they would too, because one was Russian, one was Polish and one was, I guess French, because we had a very sweet Frenchman who spoke beautiful English. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And whatever we were saying, he says, “Sister,” cause they call the nurses sister, “don’t say” -- and I think we were -- I forget the word we were saying, but -- excuse me, but we were saying shits. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And he wanted -- he said, “It’s deeareeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">That’s not nice,” he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Cause we’d stand at the -- at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and yell out these three words and those who had diarrhea, would raise their little old hand up, you know and we'd go over and we’d give them their medicine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="694">QUESTION:  Huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And that’s how you cared for them, huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  That’s -- that’s the only way. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I don’t think we kept any records. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Maybe number wise, I -- things like that I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I know we didn’t keep records, cause we didn’t know their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Towards the end of our stay there, things seemed to ease -- you know, maybe because we’d been there long enough to not be so tense, that we were able to talk to some of the patients through an interpreter. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And I got a couple of names that I wrote to their -- one July 15, 1995 was a sister back in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and one was some other kind of a relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">To tell them, you know, they’re begging, “T-Tell <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> I’m here,” you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And at that time you couldn’t say exactly where they were, you know, just someplace in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was the term you had to use. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">A-And you couldn’t say exactly what their condition was. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">When I got back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and I must have given my address back at the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , I got a letter from one woman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Evanston</span> , <span class="REGION">Illinois</span> and she had gotten my letter and sent me a check for 50 dollars, to do something for her brother, it was her brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And so by this time I’m back in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , so I wrote back to her exactly where he was, exactly his condition and sent her back the 50 dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Hopefully he was still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And I said, “Contact your Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Now you know exactly where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Whether he’s still there now, I don’t know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="711">I never heard from the other one that I wrote from, but -- to -- so I -- you know, sometimes I think -- I wonder how he made out. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Did he make it out of there, did he make it to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="713">So --
QUESTION:  So you -- you did - -you were, after awhile, able to have some communication with some of the people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">ANSWER:  Some of the -- some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Not very many. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Our -- our corpsman happened to be a great guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">He was -- I think he was Mexican and he spoke Spanish fluently and he could speak a few words of German or Polish, whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And he was able to -- well, this, you know and then you could do with hand signals, too, you know and there wasn’t much you could talk to them about. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">They were too weak for one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I don’t know if I told you the -- an-and Ecky knows I will tell you the story where we weren’t supposed to look like women and like I told you, we used to give out these medicines together and she’d give the July 15, 1995 pills and I’d be behind her with a bottle of whatever it was I had to pour out and give it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And I’m waiting for her, she’s bending over, giving this guy his pills. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And out from the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> comes this little bony hand and pats her on the fanny. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And I’m standing there- not laughing out loud, but saying, “There’s hope for them after all. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">There’s still life in them,” you know, really -- which you -- and of course, she didn’t even feel it, it was so weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And when she stood up and I’m -- and I says, “Who we kidding? </span><span class="sentence" id="726">They know who we are.” </span><span class="sentence" id="727">You know and she’s, “Why?” </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And I -- I get tears. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I can still see him now, doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">It was -- it was cute. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">It was pathetic that 1t was cute.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">QUESTION:  Did you know who these people were? </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Were they -- did -- I mean, som -- they were from different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , were there -- there were some Jewish people, mostly Jewish people, do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="734">ANSWER:  Oh, I think there were -- I -- I -- I would -- I couldn’t swear, but I would say I thought most of them were Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">QUESTION:  At the time, you did, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">But we had Frenchmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">We had one Spanish guy who worked on the ward. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">He was another one I didn’t trust, cause he was a -- a -- a trustee for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And he was - looked well preserved. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And he had been in the Spanish revolution and had gotten caught somehow and you know, and the Germans helped them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Roberto his name was. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">But he helped us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">But these people, no, we didn’t know who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">There was even Russians there too, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="747">QUESTION:  At the time, did you feel that what you were doing for them was helpful? </span><span class="sentence" id="748">July 15, 1995
ANSWER:  It must have helped a little bit, but 1t was like swimming upstream. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">You made a little progress, but not much, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">You nourished them, but you had to start out with, you know -- thin, thin soup, because you couldn’t give them food, per se. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And just the thought that they were free, you know, must have been something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">ANSWER:  And I’m sure, you know, I see pictures of these survivors now for the ho -- in the Holocaust and God, they look great. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">So they -- you know, they -- life does -- you know, the body does improve.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">QUESTION:  Oh, you mean survivors today?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="756">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">That they interview on TV and you would say n -- look at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">You couldn’t have been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">You know yourself, if someone’s really sick and loses a lot of weight, gets better, they do come back, but -- the body is a wonderful machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">So -- it’s too bad it gets abused.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="761">QUESTION:  How long were you at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gusen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="762">ANSWER:  I would s -- I think about five weeks we were there, because we left to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , either -- it was either on my birthday or the day after. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">It was either June 21st or 22nd, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">My birthday.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And were you informed suddenly that you were going to leave and --
ANSWER:  I think probably a week’s notice, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">July 15, 1995
QUESTION:  And did you -- by the -- by the end of that period, did you feel as if some of the people that you were caring for had made progress, or -- was the situation better when you left than when you came?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="768">ANSWER:  Well, the -- the attitude was better, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">It wa -- it was a lot more relaxed, because we went in there with -- so tight and so tense and you were all literally afraid of them, because, you know, they were so riddled with disease and hey, you know, you’re protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And --
QUESTION:  Did any of the nurses get sick?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="771">ANSWER:  Well, as far as we -- now, they’re talking about the DDT, which you heard about. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">The -- you know, several of our nurses have developed breast cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">But, with the ratio of breast cancer today, I -- I can’t see blaming it on the DDT that we had --
QUESTION:  You didn’t tell me this -- you were sprayed with DDT every day”
ANSWER:  Every day, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Down our pants, up our arms and in the back of our necks. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">She had an old flint gun, I don’t know if you know what a flint gun it. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">It’s a -- it’s a ca -- a canister on the end of a sh-sh-sh pump thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And I think flit they used to use for flies or mosquitoes or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">You’d fill this canister with whatever and that was filled with DDT powder. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And we’d stand in front of our chief nurse and pull our pants out. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">How degrading, when you think of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">But that’s how we had to go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">The first couple of days that we worked at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , we felt so bad, so dirty, so contaminated, that we would come back to our nurses quarters and literally strip, outside the <span class="DLF">door</span> and just drop our drawers right there and these nice German girls would grab them and wash them for us, cause we didn’t want to go in the July 15, 1995 <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with this aroma around us. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">You know, and -- and that odor clung to you -- your clothes after awhile, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">So -- and after awhile you didn’t notice it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="787">ANSWER:  Well, I know they got musical instruments for some of the inmates that were musically inclined. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">I don’t know where they came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">I imagine they just walked into somebody’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and took them. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">That’s what they usually did. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">This Jeannie Striker that I gave you her- her papers, she worked with the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Now, I never saw the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I knew they were there, but I never saw them. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Some of the men went in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and got bolts of material and brought it out to the women and she said they practically clawed at the material, they couldn’t wait to get a piece of it, to make themselves, you know, a top or a -- you know, a muumuu type dress or shorts or something, something to put on their bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And -- but that’s the only story I ever heard from her from the women.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="796">QUESTION:  Do you know if there were children around?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="797">ANSWER:  I never saw a child, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Thank God.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="799">QUESTION:  So there were survivors there who were well enough to play musical instruments?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="800">ANSWER:  Yeah, but, you know, there were all grades of degration or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">I don’t know what you want to call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">There were some that could not move at all and some that walked around. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And yes, they could play a violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Maybe not as well as they did in days gone by. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And the spirit is always there, I guess, if you’re a musician. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">I’m not. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">But --
