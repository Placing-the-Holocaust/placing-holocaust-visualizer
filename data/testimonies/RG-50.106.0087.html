<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Elzbieta Lusthaus.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  And the date of birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  May 15, 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  And place of birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Would you talk about your childhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">My parents were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iwonicz</span> , which is a <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My father was a physician, and he and my mother had been married for two years when I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">They were very happy together, they were looking forward to my birth, and things were pretty idyllic. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">In 1939, the war broke out in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">The Germans invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and my father, being a physician, had to join the Polish Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Before he left for wherever he was going to be sent, he went to say good-bye to his parents, who were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">At that time <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was partitioned, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span> was in the <span class="REGION">Russian sector</span> , and where we were living was in the <span class="REGION">German sector</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And when he tried to get back to us, he was taken as a prisoner of war to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">When he didn't come back, my mother became very worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">But she was a very strong and resourceful woman, and so what she did was she sold everything she could in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , because I think we were probably one of the few Jewish families; there may have been one or two others. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> was where her mother was living. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And so where does a young woman who doesn't have a husband with a small child, go? </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Back to her own mother, and we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And when I did the show interview, I didn't know that we were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but I found some papers of my mother's which said that we were ina <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Part of the time we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> with my grandmother, and then we were taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And my mother was allowed to go out and work for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My mother was a pharmacist, but I don't know if that's what she was working as. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Iremember when they took my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I was probably about three years old, I remember when she went. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And from my mother's papers I learned that she was concerned that they were going to do another transport with young children. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And so because she was able to go out, she had connections, and she found someone who sold her Christian papers, so that we went to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milanowek Potashawol</span> (phonetic). </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I think it was probably around 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  Now, this was in '43, and so you would have been five years old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">It may have been '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I have pictures of myself in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> in '42, so I would assume it was either '42 or '43 that we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milanowek</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  And you had different names on the papers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">My name was Barbara Stachura and my mother was Maria Stachura, and we lived with a lady by the name of Mrs. Gesia, which is a diminutive of Genowefa Bandyrowa, and her two daughters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  And how did you find them or how did they find you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  They were friends of friends of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Somehow they had no connection to us but they were willing to hide us, and so we lived with them until the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And at times I lived upstairs with my mother, at times I lived in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I was usually drugged when I was put in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> because it was a dangerous time and my mother had access, I guess, to medication. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">At times I was allowed to play <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and my best friend at that time was Wisia, and Wisia was the younger daughter who was nine years older than I, so she was probably 14 or so, give or take, and she was my best friend, and I'm still in contact with Wisia.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  Now, backing up, some of this story has been told to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  What is the earliest thing that you remember’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  I don't remember my father, obviously; he left when I was 16 months old. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I certainly remember my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I remember my grandmother, and I remember the Germans taking her. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">That's a very, very vivid memory for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I know there was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stone seats</span> , and my mother had always said to me if anything bad is happening, you go into this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and you hide under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And when they took my grandmother, I went and I hid under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  This was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  No, this was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Okay, in the -- okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So you remember that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Iremember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And I was three, probably three or three and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And I don't remember going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milanowek</span> , but I remember living there. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I remember the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I remember the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">We had a very, very large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> which had tiles on it, and that was the only place that you got warmth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  So you and your mother had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for yourselves?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  And did you spend all of your time in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , or did you live with the family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  We lived with the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was just partitioned into lots and lots of little <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , and there were lots of people living there. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">People were coming and people were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">It was also the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> for the Polish Underground, and there were little eagles on the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , and when it was safe, they flashed certain colors, and there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">cupboard</span> with a false back. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I mean, this was a very exciting <span class="NPIP">place</span> in which to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But I thought I was Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> ; my mother never went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I never questioned that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  Who did you go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  I went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with the Bandyrowa family, with my best friend Wisia and her mother and her older sister, and at times I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  So that's something that you just always did, and it --
ANSWER:  Oh, absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  You didn't think anything of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Iwas getting ready for my first communion, I was preparing; I mean, this was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And the Germans were there and everybody hated the Germans, and there were secrets, but in those days, unlike now, children didn't question. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Ifthe parents said this is what's going to happen, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Sometimes my mother would go away for days at a time, and I never questioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">If I asked Wisia, she would say I think your mother's working in a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , or the Germans are looking for people, and she was hiding, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And there were other people in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that were hiding, so it was not anything alien in any way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  And what was your understanding of what the other people were doing there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  There was a war going on, there were bombs falling, people's <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were being destroyed, people's families were being killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">People shared. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">You know, if you had food, you shared it with other people; if they had food, they shared it with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I remember being hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">There wasn't always enough food, but we grew vegetables, and we had milk that was brought in, and we did the best we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">But everybody shared, and it was war, and there were bombs falling. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">There was very little meat, because all the meat went to the front for the soldiers, and the Germans were taking a lot of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And everybody hated the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I mean, that was a common thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  And do you remember hating the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  Oh, absolutely, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And there were times when my mother would put me to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and she would tie up my throat, and she would put carbolic acid around, because the Germans -- that was a smell that you used in <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , that was a smell that you used to disinfect. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And they would come and she would say krank, meaning sick, and she said we'll pretend that you're sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Period. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And if they asked me questions about my father, I knew my father was in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , and that was a positive thing, because obviously if he were in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , he was pro-German, and we were, you know, just a good Christian family whose father had been taken away by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Then after the war ended, and the Russians came in to liberate us, then my mother said now we can't tell the Russians that Daddy is in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  So you were about seven then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  The war ended in'45. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I guess, yeah, probably around seven. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So now we're going to tell them that he's in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> or a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , and that was okay with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I mean, I was a very good child and I did what my mother told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">There was not a question of saying why or, you know, there was a war and people were getting killed, and I didn't want to be killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  Do you remember being afraid that you would be killed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, because the bombs were falling, and for years afterwards when I saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , I would expect bombs to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Even when I was -- you know, after we had left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , I was very, very scared of bombs and the noise and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> going over, because that's what <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> did in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> during the war, they dropped bombs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  You said that you spent some time in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Was that when the bombs were falling that you went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  Sometimes, also sometimes when they were looking for Jews, and my mother looked very Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I guess I didn't, although when I talked to Wisia when I did the show interview, she told me that one of the things she was supposed to do was to keep me dirty, and so when I played <span class="NPIP">outside</span> with all the children, I was always covered with mud because I wasn't blond, and everybody else was blond. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And that was fun, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I mean, imagine being a little kid and your big sister puts mud on you and your mother doesn't say anything about it, everybody thinks it's cool. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So that was kind of a fun -- fun part.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  So Wisia was nine years older than you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  That's right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  And she was your best friend?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  She was my best friend.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  She looked out for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  She looked out for me, exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Were there other children in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  Some. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Actually, the caretaker who lived in a little <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> near the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , who was responsible for taking care of this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , had I think ten or eleven children. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">There were seemed like zillions of children, and we all played together. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We tried to lead as normal lives as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Sometimes we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , sometimes we didn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  What made the difference whether you went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Depending upon what the situation was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Ifthe Germans were coming, then <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was not in session. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">If we needed to hide, we hid. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">But nobody questioned, everybody hid, everybody did what they were told.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  And what kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did you go to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  I went to <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> with the Sisters of St. Ursula, the Grey Ursulines, and I finished -- I don't think I even finished second grade.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  And did that seem natural to you, to be going to a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  Well, I was Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I was Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Ofcourse. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and I prayed, and I prayed that my father would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I prayed he would be there when I went to do my first communion. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And I know now that if anything had happened to my mother, that this family would have kept me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  And you would have stayed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  And I would have stayed, and I would have been a good Catholic girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  What else do you remember about that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  Flowers on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , fruit on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , you know, that we ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">When the Russians came in to liberate us in '45, they came and they took over the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and they wouldn't allow anybody out. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And we had a woman who delivered milk, and she had to go and deliver milk but they wouldn't let her leave, and I remember she tied I thought they were sheets but it turned out it was a rope, and she went down the rope, through the <span class="DLF">bathroom window</span> , and everybody thought that was a really interesting kind of a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And I remember when the Germans were leaving as the Russians were coming, and everybody was cheering because they were leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And there had been some German children in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> that were pretty nasty, and they were fleeing with their families, and that was kind of nice, too, because they were doing what we had been doing, and now we were sort of on top and they weren't. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And the Russians were nice, and they were giving us food and stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  The Russians were nice?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  Very nice, extremely nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">They came and they liberated -- liberated us, got rid of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And then we left shortly after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Now --
QUESTION:  So there was no mistreatment from the Russians?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Oh, no, not at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I mean, we left within a couple of months of when the war ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">My mother and I were taken by -- Wisia's father was apparently in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , the Germans had imprisoned him, and when the Russians came, he was released. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And so he drove us to the <span class="REGION">Krakow area</span> , and my mother put me in a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and she went looking for family, and of course she found no one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  She put you in a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  What were the circumstances 1n the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  She was -- I was still one of -- I was one of the young children, and I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was in a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , and this was a different set of nuns, different order of nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I don't know how you would translate that into English. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They were called Prezentki, and maybe I can find out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  Now, were you still being considered a Catholic child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">At that point, when I -- when the war ended and the Russians came, my mother told me we're going to tell the Russians that Daddy's in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German camp</span> , and I want you to know that we're not Catholic, that you're Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And I was horrified, because I -- you know, I was into the dogma, and into the teachings of the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And I went to talk to my priest, and my -- and I said I'm not Catholic, Father, I'm Jewish, will I burn in <span class="NPIP">hell</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And he said yes, go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And that was a pretty horrifying kind of a thing, that was pretty awful to be told that, because I had been -- through no fault of my own, all of a sudden I had changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">But when we -- when we left to go to the <span class="REGION">Krakow area</span> and my mother said I'm going to put you into <span class="BUILDING">school</span> so you're safe, she's said you're still going to have to pretend that you're Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  You were horrified when the priest said --
ANSWER:  Yes, absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  -- you're going to burn in <span class="NPIP">hell</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  Did you talk to your mother about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">She said well, that's what they think, but that's not what we think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  And then how did you feel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  I was confused because I hadn't really met any Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I didn't know what Jews were like. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">But before we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milanowek</span> to go to the <span class="REGION">Krakow area</span> again, my mother said we're going to go see if we can find any of our Jewish relatives, and then you can see how nice Jews are.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  When your mother said you're a Jew, what did you think that meant, being a Jew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  It meant that I was the awful person. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">You have to remember this is in the early '40s, where the Polish Catholics thought that the Jews had crucified Christ and they were awful people and, you know, there was a lot of antisemitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">You know, I can -- speaking as an adult, I didn't know that then, but they were the bad people. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">They were the people that the Germans were taking away because they were so bad.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="420">QUESTION:  What had your parents' religious practices been before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">ANSWER:  My father apparently came from an extremely orthodox family. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">My grandmother had shaved her head and she wore a wig. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">My mother came from a very observant family, but not to that extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">So but they both had strong traditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And they continued, you know, when we had our own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And Judaism is a religion that you can practice in any way you want, to any degree you want, so it's very permissive in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">QUESTION:  So you were going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with the Church of England?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="437">QUESTION:  So you had to wait several years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">ANSWER:  Five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">QUESTION:  Was that for a quota that you had to wait?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">ANSWER:  Apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Then they passed some special law that allowed us to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> as -- you know, we were stateless, and we were allowed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And my great-aunt and uncle guaranteed that they would take care of us and support us. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And we were healthy.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="550">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>

QUESTION:  When the tape was cut off, you were talking about moving to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> with your husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">QUESTION:  And your two children were born there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">But prior to moving to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> , I did eventually go back to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> , and I did get a master's degree in social work. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And I worked for almost a year for <span class="REGION">Montgomery County</span> , and then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> , and my two children were born there, and I went back to work as a social worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And after being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> for about eight years, we moved back to the <span class="REGION">Maryland area</span> , and we've been here ever since. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">That's been since 1970.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">QUESTION:  Was your husband a survivor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER:  My husband came here at the age of 2._ </span><span class="sentence" id="573">He was brought over here by relatives from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> , but -- and he was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but he came here before the war actually started. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">So even though technically by our <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> standards he is a survivor, he doesn't feel that way because he really doesn't remember anything that happened prior.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">QUESTION:  How do you think all of your experiences as a child affected your subsequent life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">ANSWER:  You know, I never thought about it very much, because it really wasn't the "in" thing when I was growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">People didn't talk about the war, and people didn't talk about the atrocities and whatnot. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And I guess it was not until maybe the mid '70s when a friend of one of my friends with whom I worked was writing a book about children of the Holocaust, and my friend Joan said would you talk to Ina, Ina Friedman. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And the book is called Escape or Die. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And she said would you talk to her, because she's really interested in your background. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And I had to talk to my mother, because I couldn't really put my finger on things, and my mother didn't really want to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">But I did remember, and so I talked to Ina, and Ina wrote the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And the tapes of that are at Yad Vashem, and then she sent me the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And I don't know if my story was all that interesting, but I was very organized, because the way she's written it 1s pretty much exactly what I said to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And then I continued working. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">My children grew up, and my daughter is married. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">She's a physician and she's married to a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And my son is visiting me now, and he's in the <span class="DLF">music field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I've been married for 36 years to the same man, which is kind of nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And in 1994 I retired from my job with Montgomery County. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I had been a therapist with emotionally disturbed children, and I went to work as a volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And it's very, very meaningful for me to work as a volunteer, because I feel I survived, and so I have to give back. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And I work in the Department of Collections, which I think is the best department in the whole <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">QUESTION:  Why do you think that's the best?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">ANSWER:  Because the people are just the most giving, caring, talented people I have ever met, and they're so dedicated. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And my boss, Susie Goldstein, is justa gem. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">She's a young woman, she's my daughter's age, but she's so brilliant in terms of what she knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And we collect artifacts, you know, we get them from people, and we catalog them. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Anda lot of the things are Polish documents and Polish postcards and Polish diaries, and I translate those because my Polish is still pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I speak well, and I read well, but my writing is atrocious, because, as I said, I only went through second grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And I think I'll work at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> until they carry me out, because it's just a very, very nice thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">QUESTION:  How did you decide that you would like to work there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">ANSWER:  I think once the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> opened and when I stopped working, I knew that I wanted to do something, and I wanted to do volunteer work, and this seemed to be just the right thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">QUESTION:  And is most of your work there translating?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">ANSWER:  I translate, I type, I file. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I do whatever, whatever they ask me to do, but my primary job is translating.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">QUESTION:  And how much time do you spend there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="608">ANSWER:  At this point I'm going one day a week, but when it gets warmer I think I will go two days a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And now we survivor volunteers are going to be involved with the Kovno Exhibit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">QUESTION:  With the what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="611">ANSWER:  Kovno.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="612">QUESTION:  What is that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">The exhibit is opening the 19th and 20th, I believe, or the 20th and 21st of November, and we're going to be involved in making sure that the survivors of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> get to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">busses</span> take them, and then have a <span class="INT_SPACE">hospitality suite</span> that we're going to have for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">There were a lot of survivors apparently that are coming to this exhibit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">QUESTION:  And this project 1s being done, did you say, by the survivor volunteers at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">We're going to be just helping. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Oh, no, this has been a several-year project that's been going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="620">QUESTION:  So the survivor volunteer group at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> --
ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">QUESTION:  -- is especially active --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">QUESTION:  -- in this project?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">We're going to be the hosts and hostesses that are going to be welcoming the survivors of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And it's just for the opening, it's just going to be for the two days of the opening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">QUESTION:  Could you say something about the survivor volunteers as a group at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">We started meeting with Martin Goldman, who is a gem, and we're discussing issues, things that concern us and the things that we'd like to see happening in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">I guess we'd like to have a little bit of a voice in what's going on, because once we go, you're not going to get any more survivor volunteers, we're it, we're the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And that's the other group that's so very dedicated, that I am so impressed with, is how dedicated the people are, and you know, we talk and we're kind of a support group to each other, which is kind of nice, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="631">QUESTION:  So you're a group within a group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">QUESTION:  Are there other survivor volunteers in the collections department?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Yes, there's -- we come on different days, so I don't really know them, but there's a woman who translates French, and there's another woman who translates Polish, and she goes to the <span class="BUILDING">Linthicum</span> , which is the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> for the collections department where we have a lot of the artifacts there, too, and she translates. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">She just doesn't like to come downtown, so she prefers to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linthicum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">QUESTION:  So you have a lot of feelings about your work with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">ANSWER:  Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">QUESTION:  And the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> itself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I think it's a wonderful thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">It's very special.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">QUESTION:  What about in your personal social life? </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Are you involved with survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I don't know any survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">You know, my friends are from my work or my husband's work. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">We play <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">We play <span class="DLF">bridge</span> with the same six couples for 25 years, we play duplicate <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , we meet at each other's <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , and we're sort of a tight group. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And then I have friends from my early days, from <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , and a lot of my sorority sisters are living in this <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And in fact it's kind of cute, but one of the young women in the collections department is a sorority sister, you know, 30 years apart, but still we laugh about it that we were in <span class="BUILDING">sorority</span> together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">QUESTION:  So your friends are mostly not --
ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">QUESTION:  -- survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">I mean, I don't -- if they happen to be survivors, that's fine, but I don't think I look for survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Most of the survivors that I've met are at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">QUESTION:  And do you see people that you work with at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> outside of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">ANSWER:  Not really, but we're going to because we're going to have to plan all these things for the opening of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , so we're going to be getting together as a group and discussing how we're going to do these things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">QUESTION:  And what about being Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="661">The last we talked about that in the interview, you were still a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">What happened to that confusion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="663">ANSWER:  Well, I'm very -- I'm Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I'm Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I get -- I still get a fuzzy, nice fuzzy feeling when I go into a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and I've gone to weddings and I'm very comfortable in a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">But I'm Jewish and my children are Jewish and my son-in-law is Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">When my daughter was married, I had no family at the wedding, obviously, so I really maintain my husband's family. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">He comes from a very large family with lots of cousins and aunts and uncles, and I maintain that relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And my daughter's in-laws are really fantastic people. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Their name's Herskowitz, and they've sorted of adopted me so I feel like I do have a family, which is very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And I wonder what would have happened if there had been no war and if I had lived in my <span class="BUILDING">cocoon</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="672">My parents came from well-to-do families. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">We had lots of servants. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">We had, you know, everything that we could desire, and we lost everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="675">QUESTION:  What do you imagine would have happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">ANSWER:  I guess we would have stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">My father was, you know, a physician in the <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Probably would have traveled, probably would have gone skiing in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> or whatever, and I wouldn't have had these experiences, so I guess everything happens for a reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">But my mother was a very strong woman, obviously, because she saved us, and my mother always said if you have something, 1f you have money or whatever, you need to spend it, because if you don't, the devil comes and takes it. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">So you really need to enjoy if you have things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">QUESTION:  And have you lived by that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">You know, we like to travel, and we go skiing a lot, and we have a good time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">QUESTION:  And what about your Jewish religion as far as involvement in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> or observance of holidays?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">ANSWER:  We observe all the holidays, and if Ellen, my daughter's mother-in-law, does Rosh Hoshana, then I do Passover, or vice versa. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">We do a lot of things together. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">That's very important because it's family, you know, it's more than just observing a holiday, it's family. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">You don't have to go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , you can just feel it in your heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">QUESTION:  So that has evolved for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">QUESTION:  Into something meaningful?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="693">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="694">QUESTION:  And what about having children? </span><span class="sentence" id="695">What was that like for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  Well, my children were luckier than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">They had two parents all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Even when we moved, they had two parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">You know, they're very, very nice young people, so I guess we've done a good job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">QUESTION:  What --
ANSWER:  I'm looking forward to grandchildren someday.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">QUESTION:  What was it like for you when your children were the age that you were when you were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and in hiding, and they were having a life very different from the life that you had?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">ANSWER:  I didn't -- you know, I didn't even think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Having children was such a special miraculous kind of a thing, and watching them grow and do all the things, and taking pictures of them and just enjoying everything they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I did -- you know, I didn't really compare. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">You know, they went to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> and they had Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, and they grew up to be nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">That's the most important thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">The past is sort of a prelude to the future, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">You can't dwell on it because you can't undo it, you can't do anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I think it's made me a stronger person, but if I could change it, I would have rather not had that kind of a past.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="710">QUESTION:  What have I not asked you that I should have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">You're very thorough. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">QUESTION:  Is there anything else that you would like to say or anything else you would like to talk about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">ANSWER:  No, I guess I would just encourage people to come to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , because it's a very special <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Well, thank you very much for your contribution and for giving your testimony today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">ANSWER:  Thank you.</span></p>
