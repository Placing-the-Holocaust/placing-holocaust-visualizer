ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Thank you, thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Your majesty, King Carol returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> in 1930. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">You were nine years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">As I understand it, he took charge of your education and upbringing at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Can you talk with us about your relationship with your father in those years, and about the education that he organized for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Well, two things here. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">One was my personal feelings and personal relationship with him, and the second part was aj -- was about the schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My personal relationship with him, to put it quite frankly, was not all the very best. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I don’t know how many people in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> are quite aware of what went on at that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I don’t want to say too strongly, but his private life is the one that -- that other people know more about. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">As you know, probably, that he had a connection with a certain person. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">As far as I could recollect what I was told, that started when I was about two years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And in the 20’s he left <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and renounced his rights to the family and to the throne and to everything concerning <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">So then when he came back in 1930, with a promise that this person was not going to come back with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">He finally did bring it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So this situation got, well let’s say practically out of hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Because of this, my mother had to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So she left for good in 1932. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">So he had been away in the 20’s, and my mother looked after me and gave me -- this is the way we [indecipherable] in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , you know, the first seven years at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And that’s something that normally remains with one for the rest of your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And the life after, when my father came was so totally different that it just was very, very difficult for me to really take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Well, that’s one part, but the part of my education where I must say I was thankful to him because he had an idea, which 1s certainly very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">He made a special <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for me inside the <span class="DLF">palace grounds</span> , but in the [indecipherable] and we started with 12 boys in this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , each one of them from another part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and from completely different social standings. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">From sons of simple peasants right up to sons of some industrialists, or intellectuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So that helped me to, say to rub shoulders with a very good part of the Romanian people, even if at our age. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And the teachers that we had were selected of some of the best run <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , especially one <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And then at the end of every <span class="BUILDING">school</span> year, for about three weeks, we took off in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , a special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with everybody in it, the professors and all of us, in a different part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , we -- well, we took our lessons and courses in geography and history on the actual <span class="NPIP">place</span> where these things ac -- happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So that is how I got to know my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , as much as possible, every little <span class="NPIP">corner</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I mean not every, it’s very difficult, but a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Well, that has served me all through my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  You have just described a difficult relationship with King Carol. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">As you grew up in those years, did he talk with you and share his views about the political developments in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> that he was confronting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  I forgot again. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I forgot to mention one thing, that although my mother was gone, [indecipherable] with something was rather painful for me because he only let me go to see her twice a year for three weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> , because she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">You know, she loved art so much, she f-found a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> there from 1932 and bought this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and that’s where I used to go and see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And I can say that those six months in -- those few mon -- not few months, few weeks, I’m sorry, few weeks at the time, I could say that that really charged my batteries, because otherwise it would have been really, if I can use the expression, absolute <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Now as far his political life and that, again, I don’t think many people understand the situation at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I was never, at least not from him ever told what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">We learned a certain amount of political systems in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but that was very dry, not in practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So in all these events that f-finally led up to 1940 when he had to leave, I knew about them, of course, as a <span class="DLF">side line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">But I had to try and find out by myself from various people, but I never got anything from him, from my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And that was a terrible handicap when he left, because I was suddenly- found myself in a <span class="NPIP">position</span> without actually knowing all the details. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I knew a lot of things that were going on, but not all the details on how everything worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And that made life really difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  How did you find out what was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  What?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  How did you find out what was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  Well, of course, I could see the newspapers and some other people -- and some of the boys used to tell me things that I always expected my father to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So that’s the -- that 1s a very sketchy thing and it’s not the real basics of what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">That I didn’t find out except much, much later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  Can you describe your reaction if -- if you were aware of the significance of this, of the rise of Hitler to power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  Well, of course, that’s -- everybody knew, I knew, we saw in the papers, we knew what was happening with him, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Well, I could put it then that in the later part of the 30’s, all of Europe was catching fire, see, so we were unfortunately in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> geographically, in a very, very difficult situation from the east, then the pressures from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">We had alliances before with [indecipherable] many people knew, which when Hitler started bullying Europe, these alliances fell to pieces, unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So our part of Europe was left uncovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We had maybe an advantage as a disadvantage because we have oil, and Hitler needed oil. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">We have the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> [indecipherable] part of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I think he liked that part also. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So the whole political situation was getting more and more complicated, more and more involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But I just found these things out in a [indecipherable] so to speak, not the actual basics, not the actual mechanism of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">That was my difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Did you have the same difficulty knowing what -- what happened in Romanian political life at that time? </span><span class="sentence" id="62">There was a -- this was a period when right wing parties began to appear in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Of course [indecipherable] these people that used to come, wanting audiences to my father, but just very rarely other people, we had certain festivities. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I knew a lot of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I knew quite a lot of what they were and what they were doing, but that’s about all. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I had no actual proper contact with these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">They just sort of just -- you know, like a -- how shall I say, meet at a party, that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">But not in depth. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Now that was very difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  Some historians have said that some of those right wing political groups, the Iron Guard in particular --
ANSWER:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  -- had great appeal to young people in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Were you aware of -- of their mass ap- appeal to young people here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  Well, among the young people, yes, I have caught, how do I -- shall I say, from their point [indecipherable] long, because through their parents, I suppose, and themselves, they realized what had happened with me and my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Now that did -- I must say it was very, very gratifying because whenever we met these young people [indecipherable] the warmth was extraordinary. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Maybe I didn’t quite understand why it was happening, what the reason for it was, but this I found out years later, because they realized what 1t was which was happening with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And then you mentioned the point about the extreme right coming up, and that [indecipherable] influenced politically my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Because I must say something here, which I don’t want to be badly understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">But this person that was the cause of my mother’s sadness, she was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Not that I have any particular feelings about that, but I have a feeling of what -- because of her, what happened with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And those extreme rights were [indecipherable | the Nazi fifth column, you know, were anti-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">That, of course, connected with my father, from his private life. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Because during the 30’s I must also admit that <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> progressed enormously, if not politically, but economically. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">We have our money, the leu was practically at the level of the dollar in the end of the 30’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">We had a standard of living like <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So s -- some good did come, very much good. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">The trouble was the pol-political part that was not quite as it should have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And this background of my father with these others is a complicated matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And then of course, some political tendency, like in all parts of Europe, you know, we still have this -- how shall I put this, sort of a Byzantine influence, which is completely different to what we know in the west, politically speaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">That also didn’t quite fit in with some of my father’s ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And that’s why, towards the end of the 30’s, he formed a sort of a [indecipherable] we like to call 1t, which was not quite the thing to do, because when the real trouble started, we didn’t have the old political parties to lean on. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And then you got the situation that the extreme right started agitating out in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Very complicated situation and he fell into that. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Now, these are all things that I -- not studied, I'll say, but I found out many more details many years after. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But at the time we were all very worried and I could not make out exactly what was going on in detail, because I wasn’t told. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I had to try and pick it up here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">That’s very much in a nutshell.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  What was your father’s view about Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="99">What were his feelings, his personal feelings and his political feelings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  About me personally?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  Abo -- about Jew -- Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Well, he never talked about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Not a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">That is also something pretty extraordinary because we knew what was going on with Hitler and so on, but he never said a word to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So I can’t really say what he actually felt about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I’m sorry, that -- just one of those things I couldn’t --
QUESTION:  An-and what did he think about the Iron Guard?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  Well, that --
QUESTION:  Did he -- did he speak about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Well, the Iron Guard you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  Yeah, well that, of course, I could feel it more than hear it, to understand that he was, of course, not at all for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">He didn’t want that at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">They were attacking him because of this person. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And there were certain things that went on of course, which we also found out much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Like the execution of these whole group of Iron Guard people. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I still can’t make out exactly if he approved this or if he instigated this, or it was done by some of the government people without him knowing [indecipherable] that I really cannot say, because I was not told. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And even today I’m not very clear [indecipherable |
QUESTION:  That execution of the group of Iron Guard people, including Corneliu Codreanu himself, took place as your father was returning from a visit to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">This was actually a visit that you began --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  -- with him --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Could you talk about that trip --
ANSWER:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  -- to -- to, I believe <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">United Kingdom</span> and what your goals were and what the results were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  Well, that again comes into the same <span class="BUILDING">complex</span> with me, because I was there officially with him, of course, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and then we went to [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">But what was going on underneath, the discussions he had around these <span class="NPIP">places</span> , I never knew a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">It seems inconceivable, this thing, in a way, but unfortunate that that’s how it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I just know that the English visit -- you know, the English royal family, and many of the English people, did not appreciate my father at all because of his private life. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So, the official part, of course, had to go along as it normally goes, but couldn’t exactly feel hostility, but you felt something that was not quite the same as another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">In <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> that was different and of course when we ended up in [indecipherable], of course I knew what Hitler was doing and I knew who he was and so on, but I was not involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">My father and him went up in the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there, and what happened, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">What I heard that was being said, apparently, I c -- but I can’t be sure, but Hitler must have said something about the extremists. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">In what way and how, I really can’t tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But whether what happened with Iron Guard execution was because of this, a-again, I’m sorry, I can’t -- I really don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  You met Adolf Hitler at -- on that occasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Was that the first time you had met him and can you tell us your impressions of him and the people around him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  Well, of course I saw them all around there the first time I have ever been to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">But [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">That was a very -- just to show you, there was a awkward thing that happened that’s [indecipherable] neither here nor there in this whole thing, because everybody knew my passion for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and mechanics. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So I happened to look out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I saw his big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So one of his aides, I think, was [indecipherable] so, are you interested in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">autos</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I said well, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So they took me down and offered me to go in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> of his, ride it up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> at the little eagle’s nest, what you call it, it was on top of the [indecipherable] and we went down, ju-just to show you I was out of all this thing that was going on 1n-<span class="NPIP">inside</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  And your father did not reveal in his attitude or -- or mood, what was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  No [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  In this same trip, when you visited the <span class="COUNTRY">United Kingdom</span> -- I know because I’ve seen a photograph of a dinner at <span class="BUILDING">Guild Hall</span> , where you were seated with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Can you talk about him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  No, I think we just talked, you know, what one talks at a big party like that, but nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And some of the newspapers had some funny jokes about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They were wondering if I talked to him about fishing, because he was supposed to be a good fisherman, or something, but not -- you know --
QUESTION:  So at this time you were not aware of or talking about the Munich accords and the results of this for <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Not at all, unfortunately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  When did you become aware of th anti-Semitic nature of political groups like the Iron Guard, and the League of National Christian Defense of -- of Achay Cuza, and -- and the National Christian Party that had both Goga and Cuza.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  Well, there was Cuza, of course I met him, but I didn’t have very much contact with him, so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But all through the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> year, the ’37 - ’38 - ’39, I could feel it was -- something was boiling up. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And I was again, very much aware of what was happening, but without knowing all the underneath and how the mechanism was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">What was happening 1s -- well we were all very concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  Did you ever see the demonstrations that took place in the <span class="DLF">street</span> by these groups?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  No, no, no, we were all but closed in in this thing, and when we used to go out, any event or something locally, that was kept out. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">But, when he got to the [indecipherable] in the beginning of 1940, then of course I could hear them screaming <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , not yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Now then -- I did find out that they were screaming because they wanted all the change because of what happened with Codreanu and the [indecipherable] this whole story has ever been brought up and [indecipherable] getting more and more acute. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Not yet. [</span><span class="sentence" id="161">indecipherable] I didn’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  You made reference earlier, your Majesty, to the political reorganization that your father made here in na -- in the early part of 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  Did he talk with you at that time about what his goals were, for the Frontul Renasterii Nationale, th-the Front of National Rebirth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">That was [indecipherable] in the new constitution we made in 1938, of course we had to learn all about that in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">We practically had to, not quite but nearly, learn it by heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">My reaction to that was -- what shall I say, sort of unknowing of the details on the things brought this thing on, that I only found out much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Probably the dissatisfaction of my father, because certain politicians would not exactly follow what he would like to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">A certain amount of friction among them. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So what I made out later on was that my father got fed up with this way of happenings. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">So that’s why he put them out and introduced this new Frontul Renasteri1, they called it, which was -- looked to me like on the basis of some sort of -- not extreme right, but very right. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">You know, all uniforms and all sorts of things that were not in our character. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So of course the general population did not really appreciate this sort of thing, but we couldn’t do much about it then.</span></p>

QUESTION:  -- last year that King Carol was king, and the last year before you became king was a very complicated and troubled period in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">It was a year that began with the murder of a prime minister, of Armand Calinescu. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Do you remember from that period, the impact of that murder on the <span class="BUILDING">royal house</span> and on your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  Well, I do remember something, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">My impression of the time was that this was the revenge of the Iron Guard for what happened with that group that was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">That’s what we imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">What happened afterwards, was a sort of a revolt among the people’s feelings because those three people that actually killed the prime minister, were caught, brought to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they shot him and were shot in the head, and left them lying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">That I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So the reaction of the people was that no matter what they did, how much of -- th-that’s not the way to behave in a civilized <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">That was the reaction. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">They even came, a lot of people -- town people, I think and maybe some other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and they put flowers on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">That I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">What happened, we were at the time [indecipherable] we were leaving for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Torchyn</span> , because there was some work being done on the -- behind the <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And we were -- I was at lunch with my father when we heard the -- some screams on the radio, which was cut immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And then here’s the master of the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , or the marshalle of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , as you call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">He was on his way back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , he came back rushing, and came in and said -- I can tell you the word he said was Armand, which was called Armand Calinescu, is dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">The reaction, I saw my father go white in the face [indecipherable] he went up in his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So wa -- that’s how I -- how I saw it, I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Well, after that he called me up to his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and started to -- you know, he was on the shock, deep shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">He said a whole bunch of things that I should realize that these people are murderers, that any day he could be shot also, that -- I don’t know a whole lot of other details which I don’t quite remember, but I know that he was -- what shall I say, he was -- he -- he was going to pieces, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Well -- and after that I think they must have talked in the [indecipherable] because I don’t know again the details [indecipherable] not explain, were not told. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Now that was the reaction, I was there, I li -- I lived with.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">QUESTION:  Did he ever recover his control of the situation after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">ANSWER:  Well, he was in control for quite some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">But then, you know, Europe -- Europe was going to pieces also. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Then the -- the way the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> had to navigate between all these things going on was getting more and more complicated. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">As I said before, the real political parties were -- were nowhere present, and he was more or less quite alone with this new thing that they produced. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So he was in control, of course, but the feeling in the population was going down and down, so that was a difficulty. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">This 1s all the things that I suffered -- I suffered it, I was living with it, but feeling it from the boys at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and things I saw in the newspaper, but not the actual information, properly be given to me of how and what is going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">That I didn’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">QUESTION:  In 1940, King Carol invited some Iron Guard members, including Horia Sima into the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">How can we understand that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  That’s one of these things difficult to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">You see, we got another situation which was rather humiliating for my father in a sense, because this General Antonescu at the time, which was very much against him because of his private life and because of his politics with these party things and so on. [</span><span class="sentence" id="209">indecipherable] was against my father in certain declarations. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So being a officer when this wi -- went down very badly with my father, of course and he put him under <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ar -- sort of a house arrest if you can call it, in a <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">In the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> [indecipherable] and he put him away. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Not -- not <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , but anyhow a semi -- semi-free [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Again, a situation evolving in such a way that suddenly he had to call him back to put him in some <span class="NPIP">position</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">See, it’s a very, very awkward situation, all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And I just saw these things happening, but I couldn’t get the underneath of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I know that the Legionnaire [indecipherable] had been contacting Antonescu, but without knowing what and how long -- what was being prepared, that I didn’t know at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">I don’t want to jump too far forward, but --
QUESTION:  [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  -- but in the beginning of the 40’s, of course, on top of the situation -- internal situation and we got [indecipherable] from the Russians, and then we got [indecipherable] for <span class="REGION">northern Transylvania</span> , and then it got from bad to worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Only some things that sort of leaked out to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">First of all, the population around me also said we have to do something, we have to have some reaction, and there was no reaction from that point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">It was quite obvious that we could not -- our army, or anybody else could have possibly stopped the Russians from coming in, but one should have don’t it, at least a sort of symbolic something -- resistance, you call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I remember there was a crown council [indecipherable] after the Russian [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">It was a- I was not involved, but I know it was going on [indecipherable] in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , when one of the leading former politicians and professor -- maybe you know the name of Yargo, the historian. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">He was also not very friendly with my father, but anyhow he was there, because he was part of these people, so he came out of this meeting when I ha -- happened to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So he came straight up to me, I could see he was livid, in his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And he just said a very strong word and he said, all that bunch is a bunch of traitors, and he walked off. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And I -- I didn’t understand what that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Then after I found out that they got probably frightened or didn’t have backbone or whatever it is, I’m not quite sure, but they all advised that there’s nothing to be done, we just have to comply, not to [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And that’s one of the revolt of many of the people in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , is that we should have at least done something. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">But that’s about how I got to know these things, cause I was also [indecipherable] put in the sideline that I was also involved because it was the end of my schooling years, just before <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , and I was having my final exam with four other boys, just about that same period. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Now, I don’t know what you call it in English, in Romanian or the French is the baccalaureate, and sh -- all this -- you know, you get sort of torn between the home life and different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I have to concentrate on my exams, and the same time these things are going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">You’re sort of -- get to be in a sort of a haze, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="233">So that’s in a nutshell also, if I could say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION:  In this period, the very end of your father’s reign, did he ever share with you the idea that he might lose control and have to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">ANSWER:  No, I can’t say he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">You know, from -- I had this background because of my mother, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And he never talked to her -- about her, or very, very rarely. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">When I used to come back from seeing her, he never even asked me how she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">So no, I didn't -- I saw something wasn’t clicking, you know, that’s -- this is just very, very difficult way to explain it, surely, but I think some people maybe will understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  How did you learn that King Carol had abdicated, and that you were king?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">ANSWER:  Well, this was getting on, as I said before, when -- this is a little before the beginning of September, 1914, when he called back Antonescu. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">He made a prime minister, I think it was at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Accidentally, I happened to be just outside my father’s <span class="BUILDING">office</span> when Antonescu was in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And when he came out, he saw me there, he came straight up to me and just said -- he -- he always had this funny habit of talking in the third person, you know, about himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">A-Awkward. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So he came up to me and she said General Antonescu guarantees the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Then he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Now what did he guarantee, what was the situation? </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">So we come to the last part of it, this was on the fifth of September. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">On or before that, he had another audience with Antonescu when Antonescu demanded that he give up nearly all his prerogatives to Antonescu. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">That just left him with a few -- put it little bit vulgar in a way, [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">So on the fifth of September, we could hear shooting going on <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">The guards around the <span class="DLF">palace grounds</span> were reinforced [indecipherable], I met him in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">But all that night we stayed awake, until about five o’clock in the morning, and then a courier came from Antonescu with a letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">It was given to him, he opened it, and as he was reading I could vaguely see his color was draining. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And he gave this letter to this man that was the gray matter behind him, a man called Ludverrano, just gave it to him, so that he read it also, and then he said to my father in French, because he used to talk a mixture of languages, he said, nothing more to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So I was, you know, sort of shaken out of a haze, so I just said, well, what’s this? </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So then they read it to me, in which Antonescu demanded his abdication because of all sorts of things, the political situation, this [indecipherable] one thing, my mother and so on, a whole mixture of things, and that -- then -- demanding his abdication. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">So that was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">That’s at five o’clock in the morning, we hadn’t slept all night, and funnily enough there’s a certain lady there, was a -- a -- present at this same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">What she had to do with [indecipherable] I don’t know, but anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So I went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And about nine o’clock in the morning, the telephone rang. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Now one of the ladies, she said, quick, get up, get dressed to take the oath. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Now [indecipherable] slept for two hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So that’s what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I went back into the <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> after I sort of woke up. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And there’s Antonescu, the patriarch, the president of the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme court</span> , and one or two others. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Horia Sima was not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">They said he was, but he wasn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So I took the oath. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And as my father had given him all those prerogatives, he put under my nose [indecipherable] so many people didn’t understand how I can, but he made me, forced me to sign it, that <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> became a -- a national legionnaire state. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">You probably don’t remember all that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Well, this was, again, because of my non-information of what had been going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I did not quite understand what was going on really. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">So this situation was -- was again, kept quite out of [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Now one thing I must say that I was extremely grateful to Antonescu in all this unpleasantness that he did bring my mother back. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And I consider this one thing, that if it wouldn’t have been for her all those awful years, I don’t know what I would have done, cause she -- she kept me going, in a way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">ANSWER:  And bringing back all those years when I was quite small, and so [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So that’s the situation I found, and how I f-found myself involved in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">QUESTION:  And what was the tone of Antonescu toward you as king in this period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">ANSWER:  He was a terribly stubborn man, you know, and very foolishly he had this idea which -- like with -- I discovered it. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">You know, the -- the French saying says, [indecipherable] father, so is the son. [</span><span class="sentence" id="286">indecipherable] pére, [indecipherable] fils. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So he probably had this stupid idea that I was rather influenced, or that I was going to follow in my life like my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So he kept me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">He certainly was not particularly friendly with me, no, because of this mentality of his. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So, all this attitude of his went on til 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">He was cold, correct if you like, which he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">But personally [indecipherable] around it, you can feel these sort of things, 1t was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">He had great respect for my mother, that he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">She managed to put certain things through with him, but that’s about all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">QUESTION:  The National Legionary State --
ANSWER:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">QUESTION:  -- for historians, meant for <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> move towards alliance with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and action against the Jews, and --

QUESTION:  Can y --
ANSWER:  -- well --
QUESTION:  -- can you speak about this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">ANSWER:  -- that situation with the Legionnaires, they didn’t last very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I don’t know why -- perhaps Antonescu used them or they used him or something to get my father off, but 1t’s very possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">But then was the famous rebellion, they called it. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">He put and end to that in [indecipherable] with a -- I think, the permission of Hitler somehow, because they were his men, after all. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">But that was all. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And from that, of course, there was an -- a verbal alliance with ro -- <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">There was nothing written, as far as I know, and that’s how he got us in 1n a sort of partnership with Nazi Germany, which was not at all in the feelings and mentality of the Romanian people, neither that right, neither at left, neither. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">We never had these sort of mentalities, but he, having all the prerogatives, he did what he want [indecipherable].</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">QUESTION:  During the Iron Guard rebellion, to which you referred, there was terrible violence against Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> and some in other parts of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  Were you aware of what was happening in the <span class="DLF">street</span> toward Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  We found that out a bit, let’s say, a few days after. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I know -- that I know very well [indecipherable] things that happened there, but I must have something else, it is not with -- not just the Jews, there were many of our own Romanian intellectuals, historians, professors, ministers, they were also in the same thing, they were also murdered together with all the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">But that’s, of course [indecipherable] discussed in the feelings of the population, but they couldn’t do anything, they -- we -- we all had our hands tied because of Antonescu. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And I don’t know if he managed to stop this, what was happening with the Jews, or did he just [indecipherable] it out by itself, I’m not quite sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">QUESTION:  Did he talk with you at any time about policy toward the Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">ANSWER:  No, he kept pretty [indecipherable] my father because this thing of the Russian [indecipherable], that they shouldn’t get anything, that they were all [indecipherable] the same old stories coming over and over again, you know, but nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">You may [indecipherable | already, and many other people that when the war was declared on <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , my mother heard it on the BBC on the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And that same morning we went [indecipherable] I called up his deputy [indecipherable] the small Antonescu we called him, and I said, what’s going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="317">We are [indecipherable] nobody tells me. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">He said, well, I thought you were going to see it in the newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">So you can see the kind of atmosphere that was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">They declare -- my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> declaring war against the Russians, and I’m not even told. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And I must find it out in the newspaper, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Y-Y-You sort of remain speechless [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  Were there people on whom you could count to share information with you about what was happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">ANSWER:  Well, this is also something. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">First of all, I inherited a number of people from my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Others Antonescu put out immediately and replaced them with his people [indecipherable] and my people run the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So, you know, you felt you’re cornered, spied on, you couldn't actually open your heart to these people and try and discuss properly -- but of course the -- the officers around me came with all sorts of information [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">We knew what was going on, but without any possibility of doing anything or even saying anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">QUESTION:  When the war began, there was a simultaneous increase 1n violence against Jews in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">C -- do you recall the -- the events surrounding the -- the pogrom in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> --
ANSWER:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">QUESTION:  -- and how -- how you understood that at -- in the -- inj -- June of 1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">ANSWER:  Well, we had information, yeah I did have information what was going on, then we had the chief rabbi, which I mentioned before, Safran, as a young man at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">He managed, somehow he came and saw me quite often, and saw my mother, and he was giving us information. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">But in the very, very early stages of this, we could not even man -- manage to talk a word of all this, Antonescu wouldn’t even listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">But slowly, slowly during the war, with more and more information coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Safran</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">My mother did there manage somehow, I don’t understand how, but she managed somehow to get Antonescu, get some reason in him. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And although these things did happen, we can’t -- I mean, be honest about it, it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I can say that no Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> was ever sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , no th -- no. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">They did send them into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transnistria</span> , quite a number of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">But maybe you also know that Eichmann was running around in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> also. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Now that was the information we got on the sly, that he was trying to get Antonescu to do the final -- what you call it the final pogrom, and -- but he refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">He let other [indecipherable] things did happen, but not this real bad one, as far as I can know -- I -- as far as [indecipherable] afterward. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Not only that, but he allowed that my mother should send a few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train wagons</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transnistria</span> with clothes and food for the Jews that were there, [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And it -- it did work to a certain degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And because of that -- you probably know that also, that my mother’s position was getting rather dangerous, from the German point of view, because of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">QUESTION:  Could you speak more about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">ANSWER:  Well, the idea that I could understand [indecipherable] you’re talking about many, many evenings about all these things, she was completely distressed about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And as I knew her, if another question that there were Jews, that there were Romanians, that they were this, or they were, whatever it was, they were human beings like us.

<p><span class="sentence" id="378">ANSWER:  Well that part is something which was not very pleasant, because there are -- we had infor -- I had information, like everybody else, through the army, that w-when the Russians came in and invaded -- you know that that part of <span class="REGION">northeastern Romania</span> , there were quite a lot of Jews living up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Now, by all means, not all at all, because many had run out, but there were quite a few, unfortunately, that collaborated with the Soviets and some rather unpleasant things did happen there also, that’s quite true. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Whether they were brought in by the Russians or they were actually ones that were there, I’m not very sure, but something did happen there. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Not that that changed the -- the mentality in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , no. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">It was just [indecipherable] about that, that’s all.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  And your decision not to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transnistria</span> , what was the -- the rationale for that decision?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="489">QUESTION:  To <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transnistria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">When Antonescu wanted you to visit the front.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">ANSWER:  Ah, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Well, he thought it was a -- because I was the head of [indecipherable] you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">He was commanding it, but I was the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">It’s a very awkward situation there because that was all these arrangements that was left over from my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">So he found, and I suppose it was fairly right, that once our troops were fighting anyhow, I should show myself among them. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Which was nat-natural, yes, but not, I don’t think for any other reason, but just that, to be among them, which I did, in two or three <span class="NPIP">places</span> , in [indecipherable] and some other <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the fronts in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> when it started, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">But only once or twice, not more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">QUESTION:  How did you finally convince Antonescu not to deport more Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">ANSWER:  This 1s a -- it’s a very long story, but I’ll try and concentrate 1t somehow, because we were so distressed about going into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , because it was none of our business. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I know the Romanians -- see, generations, you look at our history, all our troubles that we’ve had here had always come from the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So after the Russian revolution, slowly, slowly, all these years, we saw what was going on there, so this was certainly not in our mentality. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">So the fact to take back Tr- Transylvania and -- I mean <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bessarabia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchovina</span> was perfectly in agreement with that, but not any further. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">So, as things were getting from bad to worse, we’d realized maybe before th-that this is going to end extremely badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">We got together in a clandestine -- I sort of picked the words not quite right, if you like, on the sly, with [indecipherable] and our group of some officers, to try and find a way to get out of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And this started already in the end of ’42, it went all through °43 and 44. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">That’s how we had the -- well, there again you have Antonescu which is an awkward situation [indecipherable] with the Germans, doing everything with the Germans and at the same time he let people from these two parties go out to [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">They let them even have, some of them that were in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , radio transmitter. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I-It’s one of these situations that doesn’t make sense, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="509">But anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">So we sent some people out to try and contact the allies, that is the American and the Great Britain, to see what we can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">We probably don’t want to go on with this [indecipherable] we have to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">So these discussions and negotiations, recall they went on quite a long time til late ’43 and ’44, when <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> said that we won’t discuss with you any more, because you’re bringing the Communist Socialist group in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">We were all shocked about these things because what else we gotta do? </span><span class="sentence" id="514">We have in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> an -- an population of 20 million people, about. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">We had known, about 500 Communist members and another 300 sympathizers. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Well, what do they got to do with what -- this, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="517">We found that out much later, that 1t was the Soviet [indecipherable] that we should bring them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">So anyhow, they try and get [indecipherable], the -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">The situation was getting more and more dangerously acute. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">So we finally decided that we must find the right moment to tell Antonescu that he has to stop this war, or make an armistice. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">So if he doesn’t want to, he’s got to be put out. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">That’s not very easy to say, but, you know, their job was going up and down <span class="NPIP">inside</span> <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">The Gestapo sitting here, next to the <span class="BUILDING">Royal Palace</span> and the German commander too, recall [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">It’s not very funny, so to speak, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="525">We had -- just when the worst part is happening, the Russian troops were coming close to our <span class="DLF">borders</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">The Germans funnily enough, they took two Panzer divisions from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and put them up in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Maybe -- maybe you heard about all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">But that gave us a sort of a little <span class="INT_SPACE">breathing space</span> , but we still couldn’t do anything on our own completely, because we asked for help from the allies, which we didn’t even get an answer from then. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And that’s because of the Soviets, we knew that after. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">So, to bring a very long story short, when the front collapsed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bessarabia</span> in the north, Antonescu came back from the front in the 22™ or something like that, in August, through an indiscretion [indecipherable] we heard the telephone conversation, from his <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , saying that Antonescu is going back on the front on the 24", I think was. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Well our arrangement, which have already been done, was to call him on the 26". </span><span class="sentence" id="532">We asked for strong American bombardment, for the air force to come here to hit certain <span class="NPIP">spots</span> where the Germans were, and then we hear [indecipherable] 24". </span><span class="sentence" id="533">So in a great rush, we organized the [indecipherable] for the few troops that were here, just in case, and I called him, it happened to be the 23" of August, and [indecipherable] specific date [indecipherable] just like that. [</span><span class="sentence" id="534">indecipherable] came. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And that is when everybody knows what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">It’s just that I'd like to specify one thing is that it’s always been said that it was a coup d’etat, but it -- I don’t make coup d’etats. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I was the head of state, even if he was the [indecipherable] he was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So it was perfectly on my prerogative to dismiss him. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So, not a coup d’etat, you could call it a political coup if you like, but that’s not quite the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And our greatest luck of all was first of all, surprise, because I’m perfectly convinced that the Gestapo and the Secret Services here knew that -- exactly that we were plotting something. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">The very [indecipherable] informations on the <span class="REGION">political side</span> , whereas what actually happened was the <span class="REGION">military side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And that they didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And that was a complete surprise, it took them completely by surprise, and contrary to what very many people like to say, that <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> was liberated by the Soviets, which is absolute nonsense, excuse me the word, because we finish with the Germans in 48 hours, or four days [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">When the Russians came here to [indecipherable] there wasn’t single German left. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">We -- we managed to take too, 50,000 prisoners, including the top brass, right down to the last, here and in other parts around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">The g -- the ra -- Americans bombed those <span class="NPIP">places</span> and that finished the resistance, and there were one or two small pockets north, near the <span class="DLF">oil fields</span> , which were -- that went pretty quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And that was all. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And that was the greatest luck we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I think we must have -- how shall I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="550">God’s hand in all this, because you see, another little detail was that when we did this thing in 23" of August, the Russian advance stopped, or slowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">We didn’t react at the time, because we didn’t understand, but later we understood what that is. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I personally am convinced that -- you remember in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> we had a uprising against the Germans, and the Russians stopped the advance, they let the Germans [indecipherable] the whole lot, and then they came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Well, that’s what they were hoping that was going to happen with us, only we had the luck to finish ourselves, without them. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And that disturbed them very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">But two little details which I can give you if you like, from their point of view is when -- in the <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> it was, on the night of the 23"¢ of August, the Communist man came with -- who was known later on as [indecipherable], you probably know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">He was -- came as another name. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">But -- but Toscanu, who came in straight to me in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> where I was, and he looked at me and said, what have you done, you’ve ruined us. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So I -- I was speechless. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I mean, we’d been discussing this thing for months, and I go -- he tells me that it’s ruined him. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">We understood that later, I’1l come to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">When the armistice -- what we call it here, was made up of a commission that went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="562">But Toscanu let -- leaked it out after that he went to see some important person 1-in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And he reports to him, he said, what have you done over there, you spoiled our business, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">The Romanian word is different. [</span><span class="sentence" id="565">speaks Romanian]. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">That’s how they put it. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">So he said, well what -- what is [indecipherable] you know, it’s scratching down a bit from the surface, he came [indecipherable] very slow there in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> in the northeast, waiting for this to happen, and surely they have that in mind, that the Germans were going to finish us and then they could come and do what they wanted straight away. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">But here is an very important thing, because I had the supports of the two main parties, the main ones, of course the other two also, but the strongest support of was the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">So, Antonescu was commanding the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Well, when I gave the order, there wasn’t one single defection. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And that 1s something that a -- a -- what I heard would happen in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">It seems that [indecipherable] gave the same order and nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">They didn’t listen to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And I don’t know you explained this. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Is it the military discipline? </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Is it the oath they took? </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Was it because the commanders of the big units and all that, realized as much as us that the whole thing is finished, and that something had to be done? </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Or is it a combination of all that together? </span><span class="sentence" id="579">But anyhow, it worked, see. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Not many people seem to understand quite all these underneath things that were going on, cause all our work, political work so to speak, on the sly, that lasted well over a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">It came [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">It was, of course, unpleasant for me in a sense, risking the whole thing one -- one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , but Antonescu were not an enemy of mine, he was an adversary, if you can call it like [indecipherable] I just put in English, because he behaved very unpleasantly with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">But anyhow, it was something I had to do, nothing to do with, like many people say, my revenge on Antonescu [indecipherable] that’s absolute nonsense. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I don’t have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">That’s not my mentality. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">But it was something that had to be done, and we did what we had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And that was my duty towards my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> [indecipherable] that’s the main thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">With God’s help, we managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">What happened afterwards, that is a completely different question. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">That’s not our doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">So our hope for whoever hears this thing will have a better understanding of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">QUESTION:  That’s -- that’s very interesting, and this puts an end to the Antonescu regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I want to ask you to come back with me just for a moment --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">QUESTION:  -- to 1942, when you and the queen are pressing Antonescu to not deport the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ragatz</span> , and <span class="REGION">southern Transylvania</span> and ask that, were you aware that there was a new plan to deport Romanian Jews to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">ANSWER:  Yes, that also came from Rabbi Safran, the information. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And then we had heard that Eichmann was around, running around <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , and talking to Antonescu, talking to the Secret Service here, Gestapo and what have you, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">So that’s why it was -- my mother was strong about certain things, because it’s hard to bring Antonescu’s attention, but it was unheard of, the kind of thing like that, it’s -- I don’t know, she used some arguments, I don’t remember exactly, but that got through to him, which --
QUESTION:  And you knew that these were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="598">ANSWER:  Yeah, which was fairly unusual with Antonescu, because he was very stubborn. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">But maybe he had a little soft point somewhere that my mother managed to get through. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">So he did not have anybody sent out t-to the German and Polish [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Yes, he did Transnistria, that’s true, but it could have been much worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And that was thanks to my mother [indecipherable] she managed to get this, to do something through to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And much also, thanks to Safran, because he used to come and tell us what’s -- either what is happening or what he knew was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">So that’s why we could manage a little bit to do something before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">QUESTION:  One story that we hear -- End of Tape Three Beginning Tape Four
QUESTION:  Your Majesty, I -- I have heard that when the Queen Mother wanted to be successful in stopping the deportation of Jews, she threatened Antonescu, and told him that if this did not stop, she would leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and that you would leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Is this so, and can you tell us about what actually made the greatest impression on Antonescu, and when you knew that you had been successful?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">ANSWER:  Yes, now that you mention that, I remember vaguely something that my mother told me, that she said that, something like that to Antonescu. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Was a little bit I said before, when she tried to get through to him that this is a [indecipherable] all the rest of it [indecipherable] I -- I think that probably when she added something about me, then -- that we would leave, or something like that, I think that’s true, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Now that you say it, I do remember that she had said something to me, not much detail, but just a few words to that effect, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">QUESTION:  And was this what made the difference?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="611">ANSWER:  Yes, you know, she had a very, very deep religious feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">She was more -- let’s say more Christian than religious, inspired by her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">A very, very strong moral sense, and these sort of things that were going on, just -- she could not take them. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">It was not just sitting still, she had to say something, and sometimes I heard her say to the other people some very, very -- really strong things. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And she didn't mince her words at all, so maybe in this particular occasion, she used that type of talk with Antonescu. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I don’t know, I wasn’t there when she said that to him, or maybe she -- I was there, but she said it in a <span class="NPIP">corner</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I didn’t hear her say it, but she told me afterward, now that you reminded me of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">QUESTION:  And Antonescu’s reaction once this was decided, was anger, or what -- what was his reaction?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="623">ANSWER:  What do you [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  Did you expect that the course of events --
ANSWER:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">QUESTION:  -- following his removal would lead to his death sentence?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">ANSWER:  Well, yes, we did imagine that probably something like that would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I mean, the judgement. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">But the whole way this was done -- you see, this 1s [indecipherable] one of these cunning things with the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Could I say something before that? </span><span class="sentence" id="629">I have been accused of many people that I gave up Antonescu to the Communists, which is not true, for the simple reason, on the night of the 23" to the 24"" of August, we were over our heads with reorganizing the whole thing, making the government, naming ministers, and all the rest that went with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And then, some officers in the general staff, through one of my [indecipherable] said, you must leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> as quick as possible, because there’s going to be s -- reprisals from the Germans, as the American bombing couldn’t have happened before the 26". </span><span class="sentence" id="631">So we all packed up in a hurry, and I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> at around two or half past two in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">We went out to the west [indecipherable] the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Now, we had organized with the two parties to have a team that’s going to take over Antonescu and take care of him, because we didn’t want something to happen with him like with Mussolini, get him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">So, unfortunately these two parties did not have anybody ready because it happened too quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">The only one that had a team ready of course, was the Communists [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">So around four in the morning they came to the <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> and said, we have to take care of this thing, because if nothing happens, and th -- the Prime Minister I named, General Sanatescu, maybe in a little moment of weakness, let them take him. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So they took him to the seat of the Communist party in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> , yeah, a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Well, I was in -- already in the western part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , how could I have done that, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Now, the Communists, as I was coming to say 1s that they took -- when the Russians came in here, of course they took him, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubyan</span> , I think, the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">They kept him for two years, about. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">So what happened in the meantime, the Russian troops were here, they started messing up all the political parts, messing up what I was trying to do. [</span><span class="sentence" id="642">indecipherable] come in here and smashing <span class="DLF">door</span> in my <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> , [indecipherable] on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> [indecipherable] forcing me to put Groza on, bringing in all the Communists in ’45. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So it’s not -- th-things started to deteriorate, I wouldn’t say very, very fast, but very clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">So, in the meantime the population was getting sort of worked up, moderately at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">So in the two years that Antonescu was hir -- kept by the Russians, th-the people started to see that perhaps was better during Antonescu’s time than it was now. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Which, in fact, it was, unfortunately, except for the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">So when Antonescu got back and put on trial, all these people were sort of said, after all, he’s done something, these people, look what they’re doing, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="648">On that I’m convinced that the way they did this trial, which was a farce, all of it fixed beforehand like the Nazis used to do also, like in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">It was done I thi -- I -- felt there -- m-maybe I think of it now, to -- to bring down my image. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">See -- you see, in that time I don’t know -- want to know everything that’s [indecipherable] not with the thing behind it. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Now what, constitutionally speaking, my [indecipherable] my situation was that no act is valid that I would sign without the counter- signature of the minister. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">That is in our constitution because it’s the minister that countersigns that is responsible, not me. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">So, when they came out with the sentences -- now, the Minister of Justice at the time, Patrascanu came [indecipherable] saying -- asking for pardon, which Antonescu did not do. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">With -- his lawyer did it, but not him. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">So on, and then he said no, no, no, one or two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">So constitutionally speaking, what will be my position? </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I could refuse that and sign something else, but nothing will have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">That’s one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And the second complication was that -- that there were Soviets behind it. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I’m absolutely certain [indecipherable] American. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">So even if anybody would have wanted to [indecipherable] this thing, 1t would not have been possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And that’s how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And the way they did that was -- excuse me the word, was absolutely disgusting. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Cause after all, he was a patriot, he loved his <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , he tried to defeat [indecipherable] and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">He -- politically he did it for the -- my question was what could we do? [</span><span class="sentence" id="666">indecipherable] But his feelings were the Romanian [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Although he was [indecipherable] things that went on, still. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And the way this was done was -- was not a trial, they were murderers, to put it quite frankly, and was very distressing for me and my mother and all the others, ever after what we been though. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And the way he ended, I didn’t like it, although probably something had to be done, you couldn’t avoid that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Not quite like that, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="671">No matter what he did and all that, he is still [indecipherable] you know, they did [indecipherable |

<p><span class="sentence" id="690">ANSWER:  It’s difficult to put that in one word. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">What could I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Besides being sad, it was more than frustrating. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">You see what was happening, you have your hands tied. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">I was here in the position which was supposed to do more, and I couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">You know, it’s frustrating, perhaps you’re not strong enough, but I don’t know what other words to put in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">We fought like lions and tigers. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">Our conscience, my mother and myself, is clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">We had hands tied, you know, that’s why I say frustrating, we were -- I don’t know a better word for that, but to say it was difficult is a -- an understatement of [indecipherable] you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">That’s how things happen sometimes, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">You know, they say sometimes very often that the ways of the lord are many and unpenetrable. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">We never quite know what these meanings are, why these things happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">You try to do the best, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I don’t want to be [indecipherable] you know, but I mean, you know -- you -- you think about these thing, you can’t put it out of your mind sometime. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And that’s one <span class="NPIP">side</span> -- all right, that’s me personally, you see, but I look at what’s happened to this part of Europe and my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="706">So that [indecipherable] on top of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Difficult to explain sometime, very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">People say you get bitter, yes, you do get bitter sometimes, but if you let bitterness lead you, that means you go down the <span class="DLF">drain</span> with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">That’s not the way to do thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">I mean, it’s sad and it’s painful, it’s wounds you have, but you might -- might let that take you -- lead you, because then you -- then you say, I’m not so good at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">So we tried at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">I -- I hope I managed to [indecipherable].</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="713">QUESTION:  I would like to thank you very much for sharing these thoughts with us today. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Thank you, your Majesty.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">ANSWER:  Well, I can perhaps add something, that with all these awful things that have been happening since the war, especially in this part of Europe and <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , being on a program like yours now, I do hope that maybe I can -- I brought some light into some events, to explain certain things which I’m quite convinced that very few people know. [</span><span class="sentence" id="716">indecipherable] and the thing happens as [indecipherable] you see events, you start making up your mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Make decisions, or have ideas which are not actually based on the full knowledge of what’s what. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And that is what I’ve been trying all these years to sort of bring out. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">To stop looking at the surface of things, which are bad or good, whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">What -- the point it, why have we got to a certain point if you don’t understand what’s happened <span class="NPIP">underneath</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And that is a sort of grudge I have against many people, that they dis -- they discuss the -- the signs on the surface, without bothering to go <span class="NPIP">underneath</span> and find out why, what are the causes of these things, and to make -- to try and get that thing healed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And then the rest should follow. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">You know, they say sometimes that it’s a very -- how most people cut the branches [indecipherable] off, but a very, very few that look at the underneath of the -- at the roots of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And that’s what I wish so much, with all this modern world now and the people that -- that -- you know, everything’s [indecipherable] all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> now, to -- to try and understand why did certain things happen, and the tragedy of the whole -- what will you say, let’s say in this part of Europe, a hundred million people here. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And unfortunately it’s happening in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> also now. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And we feel terrible when we see these thing [indecipherable] here, of course, because it’s my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , but when you see other things that happen -- look at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Which just -- I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">We -- we have another Romanian saying that says, when God wants to mock the people, they take [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I don’t like that, but when you see what’s happening in the world these days, you really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">You can’t understand any more, sometime. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Anyhow, I that what -- I mean they’re saying now that they’Il be a better understanding, at least as far as we are concerned, what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And I thank you very much for it.</span></p>
