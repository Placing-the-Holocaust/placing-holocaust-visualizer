ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Could you tell me some of your earliest memories of childhood growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  The time I was born, my father was running a <span class="BUILDING">liquor store</span> and we were living in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and when I was about 5 years old my parents sold the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and they moved into a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which was originally owned by my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">And they left one third of that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> to me and two thirds to two of their sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">And we lived there when I was 5 years old on. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My earliest memory, I would like to talk about that just before I was going to <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> , one of my friends in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> said, oh, I know someone who will go to the same class as you do, but he will never talk to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I said, why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Said his father is an officer in the army, and they wouldn't talk to a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And this came really as a shock to me, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I didn't know that why anybody wouldn't want to talk to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">So this is my earliest recollection that 1t was something wrong to be a Jew in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And even when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I found that person, and he never, ever said a word to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And somehow [| had the feeling that when somebody is an army officer, it might be a danger to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Then I didn't really have too much trouble with my other classmates in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but when we started to go to different to learn religion, which was everybody had to take religion in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Was this a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="15"><span class="BUILDING">Public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">It was a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , but it everybody had to take religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So the Catholic kids went to a Catholic, you know, and we went to learn Judah to learn Judaism and learn the Hebrew alphabet. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And from then on, my relationship with the non Jewish students started to get bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">They oneof one of my classmates said that, you people killed Christ. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I knew I didn't, you know, so ... But that's how it started, really, to be bad in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  Were there other Jewish students at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  There were several, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">But there were not enough to have religious studies just for us, SO We were meeting from other class, you know, and -- to make up enough students. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">The only thing I can remember now, when the war broke out, it was 1939, and I remember when the first bomb, which was dropped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , it was seven odd blocks from our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And I later heard that it was really dropped by the Germans, and they said it was the Serbians to bring in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> into the war against <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And my father then was called in for labour duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  How old were you at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  I was born 1n '32. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I was about 7 or 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  How did that affect your family, your father being called into the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  My mother originally was making was atailor yeah, a tailor, and she was sewing at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to make a living for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">But I knew that, you know, my mother my father went in, and I knew that many other people were called in, so it was not discrimination, you know, I felt, although my father wasn't having a weapon, and he had a yellow arm band which showed, you know, that he's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish labour camp</span> , you know, member. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">The first bad thing what happened in the family, my father had a younger brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">He became I don't know a Catholic or Lutheran or something, and he felt that that way he can have it easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And he volunteered to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labour camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">The only difference it was from my father that instead of a yellow arm band, they had a white arm band, but they did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And when they marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , the Hungarian and German troops, they sent him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And in about two months we got a note that he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So this was the first real shock, you know, what happened to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  And how old were you at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  I would say 10. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">10 or 11.</span></p>
