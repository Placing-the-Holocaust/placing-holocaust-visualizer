<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jasina</span> , April 13, 1925.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Where is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jasina</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jasina</span> is a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">It 1s — <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was actually from four parts, <span class="REGION">Podkarpatska Rus</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morava</span> , Slovensko, and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jasina</span> was in the part of <span class="REGION">Podkarpatska Rus</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Tell me about your parents and your family before the war, when you were growing up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  I, Iam the youngest; I was the youngest of six children. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My father was a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">He taught German and math, but he taught privately. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And we had a, a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> which was, what you would call here a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">My, my mother mostly took care of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> ; and we, were a very close and happy family. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">We, I came from a orthodox background, and we — my father took great <span class="BUILDING">store</span> by education. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Our children, his children — most of them, I mean as long as it was possible — went on to further education from — we had only up to eight grades in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but after that they would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and study in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And this was where my two oldest brothers were studying and my sister, Perla. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">However, in — when I was 14 years old, my whole life changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">My life changed somewhat before then, because my father died when I was nine years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">However, my mother was able to keep everything going; and, my brothers, wanted in fact to quit the studies to help Mother, but she insisted that they should continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So my, my brother who was studying law, he was secretary of the Zionist Federation. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And when the Nazis came in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , he was able to secure a certificate for himself and for my, for my sister; but for my sister he had to arrange a mock marriage with — to a <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , who had Palestine citizenship, and this 1s how she was able to get out to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">However, our part didn't become occupied by the Nazis, but it became occupied by the Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I was 14 years old when the Hungarians marched in. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">We, were thrown out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25"><span class="BUILDING">School</span> was not permitted for Jewish children to attend. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And as I was one day going to my to one of the classmates, to spend time with her; I, when I came back, my mother and my sister were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">They were, they were sur— they surprised them and took them away to a to, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , to a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">The reason was that they took away our citizenship papers, because my father was two years old when he came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> with his parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">So they considered us Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And anybody that was Polish, they would — they threw them out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and sent them over to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where — most of them — whoever was, was shipped out to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , were, were killed by, by, by — some by the Poles and some by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">They, they were all shot to death or, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So my mother was for, for a few months in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> ; and when I came back I was all alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I was at the time 14 years old; and it was the most horrible experience of my life, to find myself all alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">However, I had a married sister who lived about six miles from my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So I went to stay with my sister, and — but the first night I slept alone there, and I ju— I just had to, to get used to this, that my, my mother is gone and I — this is when I wrote my first poem in, in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And, and after that I went to my sister; and I tried to find a lawyer for my mother and sister, that they should release them — because they was in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , so there was still a chance, you know, on some — if you had connections, or to be released. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So there, my brother's friend was a, a lawyer in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and he was able to secure for them a six-months extension. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">But my, but I had another brother whose name was — Chaim was his Jewish name, and he was a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">He had also a certificate to leave for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">But he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> to, to say good-bye to us and he couldn't bring himself to leave us, so he, he stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">He opened up a make-shift <span class="BUILDING">dental office</span> , like just in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen chair</span> ; and he started to, to do dental, you know, dentistry and of trying to — this was, this was prior to, to the day that my mother was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So he decided, he didn't go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And, he was able then to relocate; and my mother came out and the six months were up, so he went on to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where he opened up a, a small, <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">He meantime got married, opened up a <span class="BUILDING">dental office</span> ; and he became friendly with the, with the police because he did their, he fixed their teeth for free. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And he, he, he rented for us a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there, for me and my sister and my mother, from where we never, we never left the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , because we didn't want to be that the people should know that we are there. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And he would do all the shopping for us; and, and this was our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , and we, were hiding in — Horinc was the name where we, were hiding — after, after my mother was out from, from the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , after the six months were gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">The six-month extension meant what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  The six-months extension meant that after six months, we have to, we cannot live in, in, not only <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jasina</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">We must leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We would be left, they would come for us forcibly and take us, and take us away and ship us over to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So, of course, at this time we knew already what the plan would be, so, so we escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">My brother helped us to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">He had meantime, he went, he went ahead of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">He had already <span class="BUILDING">dental office</span> and he knew already the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">We, were still — he didn't wait 'til the six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Let's say after four months he went and established himself there and got to know the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And then we had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">The way we left is we just — we had three tenants in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We didn't even tell the tenants that we are leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">We just walked out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and — like we would go for a walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">We left everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">We just walked out in our, 1n, in our only clothes — except for, for a pocketbook — so that nobody should know that we are leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And we boarded a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ; and we came first to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chust</span> because you have to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chust</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in order to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horinc</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">But when we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chust</span> , there was, they made the police was making selections — not selections; they were rounding up the people who didn't have papers, who didn't have, who didn't have citizenship papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">They were shipping them to, to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So we came at a very bad time. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">However, my brother waited for us at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and he got — and he got somebody that let us stay in a, in a — it was like a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , in a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> for, until, until, — we stayed there about one week, until this will blow over and the people, you know, will calm down again. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Because once they made their, their arrests, 1t was — it, 1t quieted down; because it wasn't, it wasn't not yet — when — <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was not bothering yet the Jews, only the ones that didn't have citizenship papers, and only from the part that they occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But deep in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , the Jews were still having their businesses and, and had all the, the freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So after that, he got us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horinc</span> , where we, were staying about — because I was approximately 16 years old when I, when I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horinc</span> , so we, were staying there at least a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">But then my brother — the police had warned him, because he became very friendly with the police—
QUESTION:  Just a—I need to slow down a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">You were staying for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">You were hiding 1n this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We, were—
QUESTION:  Can you slow down and tell us what it was like to hide? </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We have plenty of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Slow and tell us — what it was like to hide in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  I was very content, except I was very lonely because I had no friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I could not have any friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I had only my mother and my sister, who got married in the meantime so that she would have, not — she was anyway engaged to be to be married but she wouldn't have probably that young — she was only 17 years old that she married, or, or close to 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">She married so that she should have citizenship papers; and she married with whom she was anyway engaged, but she got engaged that young because of the circumstances that we had, that, that we had experienced. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So he, he got married to a dentist who had citizenship papers and she could at least be — live freely, and she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chust</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So she left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horinc</span> , and she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chust</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And I, and then I was just, I was just with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">But she would come to visit, to visit us. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">My brother would try to keep us occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">He would bring games into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and play with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">He, he used to play, the guitar. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">He would come and play the guitar after he finished his office work; and he tried, — he was one of the best people that, that lived on this, under the sun, because he — not only that he, helped, he was so — I mean, that he gave up his life for his family; but when he was a young, a young boy, he would he would take the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And when he was even working as a dentist, whoever didn't have money he wouldn't charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">He would do free dental work. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I mean, it was not just that he was helping us, but he, he'll helped other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And what I'm trying to describe that what kind of people they, they killed; and, and that people are really not only, that could make contributions to this world and what they did to, to such wonderful people, eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So, so my brother tried to keep us occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">However, he was informed by the police that in two weeks he will be taken away on forced labor, on forced labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">That meant, meant nobody knew where they are going to send him. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Without him, we could not stay and continue to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horinc</span> ; because we would be — we, were stateless, so what he did is he used to send his dental work to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nyiregyhaza</span> — which was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in, deep in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">That was not from the occupation, but that was really <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">So he got in touch with the this the owner of that <span class="BUILDING">laboratory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">It was a large labora— dental laboratory. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And he asked him that he could rent for us a cheap <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in some, in a secluded <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">He explained him the situation, and he was a Jewish man; and he asked him that he should accept me as an apprentice to learn the dental work. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">He gave us all the money that, that he had to, you know, to tide us over. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So, and then he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So, you can imagine with all this, this parting — which I described in my book — when my, when my brother was leaving, and we never knew what's going to happen to us and we never knew what's going to happen to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And, the, the last, day, we all — when he came to say good- bye, my mother, my mother fainted because she couldn't — he, he knew that.... First of all, she felt terribly guilty that we let him stay when he could be in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and now he's being taken away from us; and forced labor meant, that also you didn't know whether they will ever return. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And, unfortunately, he didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So, but, I, I— and, and he kept, he came three times back to, you know, to say good-bye to us and finally he had to leave; and, and this was the last time that we, we saw my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nyiregyhaza</span> , and we had all the, you know, we knew exactly where we are going to, to stay — which was one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> by a very poor widow. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">It had, no hot water. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It was a very dilapidated, <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , where we, were staying, and.... But I was accepted by this into that <span class="BUILDING">laboratory</span> ; and everyday I would, I would go, you know, to learn to become a dental technician. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And my mother was always at, at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she tried to make a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">However, eventually her money was, was running out; and we, no matter how we, were trying to, to save and to live, economically, eventually our money ran out and she had to, and she was, would go to stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> for, it was like, you know, like <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> and, and it was the most horrible experience for my mother, because she was a very proud person and, and she was used to help other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I will just describe you the type of a mother my mother was. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ; and, and we, were not, by all means we, were not rich people. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We, were almost poor ourselves, especial she had lost her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And we had — so we rented out in order to make ends meet, we rented out to tenants; we rented out three, we had three tenants, and not even one could pay the rent. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">They were all poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And we, were always, you know, we, were children. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">We wanted to be able also to buy ice cream and to buy chocolate and to buy nice clothes; and natural my mother never had any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">We would always tell her, "Why when you have to rent to, to people that cannot pay? </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Look. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">There are other rich people. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Why don't they take them?" </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And my mother always said, "Let them learn from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I don't want to learn from them." </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And, and she always said, "We will see that because we are doing all this good deeds, that God will help." </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And, and, and, anyway, she believed in God that whatever she 1s doing that God will reward us. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">She even used to send us as children to, to collect, for poor families that, that needed, that were needy families. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And this is how she taught us to, to help other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So now you can imagine that now she had to stand — yeah, she would even cook much more than we needed and bring to those poor tenants, so that they should have enough to eat — and now she was standing in, in a <span class="DLF">line</span> for a little soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And she was so embarrassed about it that she would not let me — she didn't even tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I didn't even know; because when I would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you know, the, the food was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And I always said, "Oh, it's, it's so," you know, "it tastes so bad." </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So then she found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where she would wash dishes to get in a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , to get one meal, one meal for, for washing dishes and even this she didn't tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">She would say she brought it. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">He, he, there was a certain pride in the way we, were brought up, you know, that this, that it's embarrassing. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And she would, she would put a pot of hot water what the landlady should think that she 1s cooking, in order not to let her know our dire need and in what bad circumstances we are, because this landlady didn't know that we have no papers and that we are just in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And I always, and I couldn't go no <span class="NPIP">place</span> because again, in case somebody would ask me for papers, I was without papers; and everybody had to have papers in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">The policemen, they came over and they asked you for you to show your papers, and if you didn't have them you were right away arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So I would always go straight <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">laboratory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And I was working between nine boys and they would always, you know, wanted to escort me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , or to ask me to a movie; and I never wanted to go no <span class="NPIP">place</span> because, because I could not afford to be too visible in case, because I couldn't tell nobody that, that why.... The only person that knew that I am in hiding was the, owner of the <span class="INT_SPACE">laboratory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">But then one day my sister arrived from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chust</span> , and it was my — I was — it was my 17" birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">She arrived on my birthday, and I was so excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I thought that she came because it was my birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And she told us that my sister, the one that was —I had a sister that was married and had three children with a husband — that they were arrested for over.... She had a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and at that time you could not just take away a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> without any reason because it was not yet you know, it, it was not yet, the Germans, the Nazis weren't, weren't yet in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">They were only in all the other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , but not in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ; so they did yet have the right to go and, and take away your <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So, so they, they paid up one, one person that wanted her <span class="BUILDING">store</span> went to the police and said that, that she over-charged. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">It was just a you know, something to pin on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So they, the police came, took away my brother-in-law to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camp</span> ; and my sister was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And the three children remained alone, so the, from our from our tenants, they — my — the tenants that were in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , she left the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">He, he begged them to let to let the children that somebody should come and pick up the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So the children were taken by, by one of our tenants until somebody from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , a cousin of hers, came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jasina</span> to take care of them; and, and she moved in with her three children into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we had, you know, that, that we had went away from. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So now my sister was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> in a in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> ; and my brother-in-law was in, somewhere took him to some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So my sister came to tell us that good news, from, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chust</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">This was the — so we started to, to plan how we could help my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Somebody has to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and try again, you know, to get a lawyer and to find out where, where she is and, and to help her. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Maybe we could, get her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So my mother, when I came back from, from the <span class="INT_SPACE">laboratory</span> , my mother told me that we cannot be anymore together, that I must go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and try to see what I can do for my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I, I started — I, I panicked. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I started to cry, "What am I going to do there?

<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  In March 1944, the Nazis occupied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I knew there was no chance for me to be able to be safe anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I wasn't safe before either, but I wanted to get to my family, to be with my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">It was — you could not really travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Jews were barred from travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">However, where I worked in that <span class="BUILDING">laboratory</span> , it was a gentile family. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">They wanted to help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">They wanted to adopt me, in order to, to remain there and to be there, there, on gentile papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">But I refused; but what I asked them instead was she should buy me first class tickets and again a paper, a Nyilas’ paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Because I knew that, that nobody will think that a Jew has the audacity, when they are not allowed to travel third class, to sit in a first class <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> and, and, and just go in style. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So she told me that, that, she's afraid I'll never make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">But I said, "You just"— she should just do what I ask, because it worked once and I hope it will work again. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">But we had to have the yellow star sewn on, so how could...? </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And if you didn't have the yellow star, then you were killed anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">They would throw you off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">This was, this, this was a law by then installed. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">So what I did is I, on my yellow — on top of my yellow star I put on a, a coat, a rain-shine coat; and I was sitting in, you know, so I have the coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I felt that if they catch me I have my yellow star, so perhaps I wouldn't be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">This was my hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">But he, he, she did what I asked her. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">She bought the ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">She came with me to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I was strai— I straight went into the — to the first class <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="562">My — I, by then I was in the meantime engaged, and my fiancé came with me, with the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">She bought tickets for both of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And it was bedlam at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> because they were arresting not only Jews; they were arresting everybody and then sort the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">So because it was such bedlam I just calmly walked in to the to the first class <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">My fiancé coached me how to jump off from the running <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> before we will reach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chust</span> , where my sister and my mother lived at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Because if I, we get to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> they are going to ask for papers, and then we will be arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">So before <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> rolls in, 1t slows down; and he showed me, he coached me how I should jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">We jumped off from the running <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Yeah, when we when we, were — did not sit together because we, in case one — in case both don't make it, perhaps one will make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">But, thank God, we both made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">We jumped off from the running <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">We fell down but it was — we didn't get hurt because it was, you know, it, it was a jump that you could that you could get up from. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">we knew how to jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And through to the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , we reached my sister's and mother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ; because we, were afraid to walk through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> in order not to be you know, asked for, for papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Then we, we arrived to, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chust</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I was again with my * Short for Nyilaskeresztes Part. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">family together, and my fiancé went back to, to his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">That was nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , so that he would be with his parents; and I was with my with my mother and sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Shortly after we, were ordered to pack only, only a suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I mean something what in — they formed a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">We, were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> about six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">A short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chust</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">We, were rounded up and we all — we stayed — we had one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with another family. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">We had to, and we had to be all squeezed in, in that one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ; and my mother baked all kinds of zwieback and noodles, things that could that could last and jams. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">This is how we sustained ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And there was you know, a, a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> opened up for, for the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">We tried to keep the children busy, to organize something, and.... But after a, a, a short while there were rumors start that we are going to be resettled. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Nobody knew where we are going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">There were all kinds of rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Some people thought that we are going to be resettled in, in, even in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> — they, they, they believed — I mean, the optimists. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">But we really didn't know what was going to, to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">But we, were all just always very grateful as long we could be together. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And we all, everybody felt that the war cannot last forever and that eventually this is going to end and that we have a chance to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">But then one day the — we, were ordered to pack a small suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Everybody could pack one suitcase; and they, they came in and they were very brutal. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">They started to, to chase everybody out. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">In fact, my mother forgot her — had dentures, and she just wanted to go back, you know, for the teeth; but they didn't let her back. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And they threw, they marched us — some to a, this — some to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> — was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and some to a <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And we had to wait for the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">But in the, then, they started to search us. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">We had to, we had to undress complete naked; and they searched for valuables, and they, they said.... First of all, my sister gave everything away for safekeeping; because the neighbors all came in before we, went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and they promised that they will, they will give her back after we, we come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">But we knew it didn't matter who gets it; so the neighbors — she gave everything away for the neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And my mother, just a pair of earrings she had put into a cake of soap, hoping, you know; she pushed tn a, in cake of soap, and she hoped that this will somehow help us in the in the long run, because everything else was taken away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">But was the worst was that they had, that we had to undress and be searched. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">They, they, they searched — they poked with, with a stick they poked in, in the vagina to see whether, whether people didn't, weren't hiding anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And my, my mother was a religious lady; and, and first, that hurt me mostly, that she had to go through such, such a terrible ordeal. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">But finally we got already our clothes back, and, and, and we, we got dressed, and as we getting on to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> — we had to, to — there was sitting one SS, and he was taking down the names; and, and as, as my mother was holding her grandson — my, my sister's little boy — and, she had a bottle of milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">My sister was still nursing, because she was afraid to, to wean him, because a child should shouldn't starve so. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">But anyway she had a bottle with milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And he ripped out the bottle of the milk, the bottle of the milk from, from her grandson's hand, and poured it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And she said — and he said, "Let me see what you have here, you Jewish cow!" </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And poured it out; and, and my mother just said, "Oh, please, I need the, the milk for the child." </span><span class="sentence" id="615">He started to beat her with, with a heavy strap, you know, with a heavy riding — this was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chust</span> , it was still just getting onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">This was the, the prelude to the, to whatever was coming after. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And I have, and I got so — and I started to scream. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I saw that my mother was being hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">That he, he turned back to me, and my mother had a chance to, to run away; and he started to beat me, but, but I was just so glad that I didn't even feel the, the lashes, as long as my mother could run away with, with the, with her little boy — with her little grandson onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And finally we got pushed into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="621">We, were already on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , all of us together. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">We, were about 80 at least in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">With this was for cattle. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">It wasn't a regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">It was, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> , that we could almost suffocate. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">There was no — we, we couldn't practically breathe; and we got — there were two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span> for, for bodily functions. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And they would, they stopped a few times so what, what was, they, they told my brother-in-law.... My brother-in- law was with us, you know — my sister, my brother-in-law and their little boy Danny and my mother and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">We, were all together on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , because my sister was taken away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jasina</span> , so she was not with us together. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">The one with the three children, and, and her husband was in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">So they were not together, so she went separately. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">We don't know — we just know that they got killed on arrival. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">So now here we are — we all, all to — together already. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And, and, and we are terribly frightened, and, and the children are crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And so finally when it stopped, when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped, they, they opened up the, the <span class="DLF">door</span> ; and they told my brother-in-law to take out the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span> , to throw out the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span> and to bring water. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">In the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span> they brought water, and we had to drink this water; but we, were glad to, to get water because everybody was terribly thirsty. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And they, they warned him if anybody escapes then we will all be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">There was no, nobody really even tried to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">There was absolutely no way, or no chance, and, and nobody had even any intentions. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And my mother was, was — we, were trying just to be as close together and to hug and to and to tell our last — we didn't know what that we are going. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">We did not expect though that we are going to be killed because I knew, our mind could not comprehend that anybody is going to kill little children. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">We, were all with little children; because we all said, "If they wanted to kill us, they could have killed us here. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Why would they bother taking us from, from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So, we made up that whoever will — in case we are separated — because there was always the chance of being separated — then we will eventually meet in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">So we, this, this was our — that what I remember the last that we told each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Now we are — the journey was a very long journey, at least about three days and three nights it took, that journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">As soon as they opened the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , prisoners in striped uniforms came on to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they started to, to yell that we should all leave everything and go down — we all must get out, leave everything in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="648">My brother-in-law by some miracle had still a watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">So he — you know, he asked them first, "Tell me what's going on here." </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And downstairs we just heard a lot of screaming and, and yelling in, in German. "</span><span class="sentence" id="651">What's going on here?," </span><span class="sentence" id="652">he said to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">My sister — as soon as they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , she ran down with her little boy; because Danny was crying and, and it was suffocating in, in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="654">It was a terrible, terrible journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">People were fainting. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">We, we, were pulling out you know, that — smelling salts to revive people. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">It was unbelievable to describe just the journey itself, so we, were already very glad when we arrived, at the arrival. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">We thought, "This is, this 1s — at least can't be worse than, than what we experienced." </span><span class="sentence" id="659">So my brother-in-law asked them, "What's going on here." </span><span class="sentence" id="660">So he, of course, didn't answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">So he had a watch, and he goes and he slips him the watch; and he tells him — and my sister was in the meantime downstairs, and I was always sticking next to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">So he said to her, "Listen, if you have, children, then give it away to, to either older people or, or the women with children, because women and children and, anybody older is going to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">They are killing the same night, the same day. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">There is no chance, chance for these people to survive." </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I couldn't even believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And my mother had the presence of mind to, as soon as she, heard that — she didn't know, this was my mother — then this man said it, she ran down with me, and, and I ran after her; and she goes over to my sister, and, and she has the presence of mind to tell her, "Listen, Darling, I just found out that women and children will have it very easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">All they will, all they are going to do is take care — is take care of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">But — and, and if I don't have a child, then they will send me in hard labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And you know I will never survive hard labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">But you are young, and you'll be able to survive." </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And before she has a chance even, you know, and, and before my sister had a chance, you know, to go not to give the child, my mother moved the child from her arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And, and, and as soon as she removed — she had the child in her arms, she was pushed to this other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , you know, with all the women and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And me and my sister were, were pushed to other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And my mother still yelled out, she yelled out to me, not to my — “Cillinka, take care of your sister!" </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Because she knew, she knew that my sister will suffer when she'll find out where she took her grandson. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And then I had a double challenge to keep my sister alive, because my sister eventually — we — there was not too long before we found out the truth — where we are, and what is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Because when they, they took us to a big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where we had to, where we had to undress and there were, and they took everything away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And just on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was the same big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , only that it had gas — only gas were coming out. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">This is where my mother and all the others were, in that <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And we, were in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> that we had to undress and dress and they took everything away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And they shoved us in to, to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> , that we have to — but what they did 1s, they first opened the hot water so we got scalded and then they opened the cold water; so as we, were running out, we, we, were we, were beaten with the, with the whips to go under it. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And then when we came out we, were all so — and first they shaved us. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">No, first we, were shaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">This was after — I can't even remember whether this was after the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> or before the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , but we, were completely, you know, they shaved our hair and they shaved our, our private parts; and, and then they shoved us in into that <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , and then they gave us — each one got some rag to put on. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Not a striped uniform, but just a rag — as if somebody could get a size six that needed a, a size 15, and somebody got a, a size — and visa versa. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And so that when we, were lined up, we didn't even recognize each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">We, we, were just — I was looking for my sister, and my sister was standing next to me; and we, we, were looking for each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And we, were so scared with that piece of soap, because they were they were searching, that I, we threw away the soap with, with the diamond earrings because we, were not supposed to have anything in our hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And we even had a hard time throwing it away, because we, were afraid they would they would say, "Well, what is this?" </span><span class="sentence" id="690">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="691">So when we, finally we, were lined up and they marched us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> ; and, and these were <span class="INT_SPACE">stables</span> that housed — and there were three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">layer bunks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">layer bunk</span> , each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> housed — they pushed on each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> 10 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Five this way, five this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And we just got a blanket to cover ourselves; and we just got — the, the food — I don't think I have to describe the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">So we are, finally — yes — and was we, were lined up. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And, and as we, were marching, and as, as they marched us, there was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp;</span> and we saw flames are shooting out, and there was such a putrid smell. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And we asked those, those Kapos* or Blockaltesters’ — whoever was leading to the to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> — we said, "What is this?" </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And you know what they said? </span><span class="sentence" id="699">This: "There are your, your mothers, your sisters, your fathers. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">They're all burning there." </span><span class="sentence" id="701">I, and, and my sister — and I said, “Menuko’,” in the Jewish’ I said, "they are only trying to scare us," I said. "</span><span class="sentence" id="702">Don't, don't listen to what they said." </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Then we are finally already in our, in our in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> ; and we had to stand roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">They counted us. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And they — and we, were, they send in each one — there were 30 in that C Lager® and each one housed 1,000 girls, 1,000 girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And now it started the, the routine. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">We, were, at before five o'clock we, we would be, we had to line up, be counted; and we got some, some coffee — which it was just some kind of colored water — and, and, and at lunch time we got some soup, and in the evening we got bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">This was all the, the portions. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">But my sister, he, he just didn't want to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">She refused to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">He, he came, she became very depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">She did not want to live; and, and she only would tell me — because we, were surrounded by electrified wires, she only wanted we should go and kill ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">She would say, she would say she doesn't want to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">She wants to go to the <span class="DLF">wires</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I always told her, "You tell me when you want to go," because this way I felt I have control and I can talk her out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">So each time she would say, "Let's go today," I would always tell her, "Not today. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Look, today we got — it's, it's too warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Why don't we wait? </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Then it was very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">We won't be able to — we won't be able to take it any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Let's wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">We always have time to kill ourselves." </span><span class="sentence" id="723">But I wanted very much to — I wanted to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I, I had a lot of, you know, zest and a lot of life in me; and, and, and also, I felt that somebody must remain alive to tell all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Because just like we don't know, we thought nobody else knew in this world, just like we didn't know, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And this is how * Foreman (German); term used in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> for prisoners appointed by SS to supervise labor squads. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">° Barrack senior (German); ° Czech diminutive of “Mina.” ’ </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Yiddish * Camp (German) I, I kept her — each day I would force, open her mouth — I would, because it would get like one day a piece of margarine with the bread, and one day a piece of, of wurst so I would change the wurst for margarine so that I could push in; and, and push in the margarine in her mouth, it should melt, that she should swallow. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Because she didn't want to — she, she didn't want to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">She didn't want to — he, he just didn't care any, any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And I was there a, a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">After, after — no — after four weeks I met somebody that, that she had she was in the children's Block’; and she told me that I should go and be with her, that it would be much easier for me because her cousin is a Stubenaltester'®. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">That means that she takes care of the Block, and she has a little bit more to eat; and she could help us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">So — but she said that the Blockaltester has would, would have to agree to it, and she likes talented children. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">She will get that I write poems. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">This is what I said, that these girls sort of saved me for, for quite a while...
QUESTION:  Tell us about the poems.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I, this — I always could express myself more in writing than in any other way and I, I liked poetry and so I, I wrote poems. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I wrote them even there. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">I, I would — anything that bothered me, I could express 1n a poem. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">So she told me, she asked me whether I had composed any poems; and I said, "Yes, I — about my mother, about the — and about the, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp."</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I had quite a few poems by then already. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">So she told the Blockaltester, and she called me. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And she said from her, from the <span class="BUILDING">children's Block</span> , from the <span class="BUILDING">children's Block</span> —not from my Block. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And she said, "Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">you tell me your poems. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">I heard that you write poems." </span><span class="sentence" id="748">I said, "okay," and I told her the poems. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">She said, "okay." </span><span class="sentence" id="750">She said, "I would like you, you can come and, and stay in, in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Block</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="751">So I said, "All right, but I have a sister in there with me." </span><span class="sentence" id="752">She said, "All right, your sister cannot be — you look still like...." You know, they were like up to 15 — like 14, 15, 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">She said, "But your sister doesn't look any more the age that I could pass her off as a children's, Block." </span><span class="sentence" id="754">I said, "Well, then I wouldn't go." </span><span class="sentence" id="755">So she said, "Okay, bring your sister." </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And, and I brought my sister, and she passed her off. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Like if they had a selection, so she would stand between the Stubenaltester — and these were all orderlies, you know, orderlies. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Between the orderlies. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And that's how she wouldn't go through the selection, because every few weeks they would make a selection for the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="760">They would select people; and if you were already deteriorated, which we started to deteriorate very fast on the on that menu that we, were given and, and under the treatment that we received. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Because we, we had to, to stand for hours and hours every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">People would faint, and we, we started to get dysenteria, and we couldn't — we had no sanitary facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">We could not drink water when we wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">We would be taken only once a day to drink water, ” Billet (German) '® room senior (German); term used in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> for lead prisoner responsible for supervision of room upkeep and maintenance. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">just like the cattle. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And then if you were thirsty, once a day or twice a day they take you to the to the latrines. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And then if you had to go — we couldn't we couldn't — we didn't have the freedom to go even to, to a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">It was absolute, unbelievable the way we, were treated. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And then people were being clubbed to death for the smallest in-infraction. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">If you didn't stand right. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">If you, if you are — if you came out of the of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> five minutes later, and, and you, you weren't right then and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And I will tell, tell you a few instances when they — it, it is up almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">So we, went, because there was something that I must get in, into — in, 1n, that was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">finally so, so I was in, in her <span class="BUILDING">Block</span> , and she would sometimes always call me in, I, I should recite some poems. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">So then everyday was a selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">She would hide me in, in an empty <span class="BUILDING">Block</span> that they had only blankets; and she would hide there me and my sister so that we shouldn't go, get through the selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Because if, 1f we would have been sel- to be selected, they would select us to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> because we, were already not in very good shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">So one, one day, they took us to those you know, to, to have our clothes disinfected. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">So they took, they took us to, to disinfect the clothes, and so we had to undress naked and wait for our clothes to be disinfected. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And the SS was waiting there with us, you know, with the dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">We, were surrounded by SS and the dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And, the Blockaltester wanted to keep them occupied, and she li— and so she thought — she di-didn't do it maliciously. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I mean, he, he just thought, to maybe to divert their, their attention maybe from other disaster. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">So we had amongst our midst a very talented, 14 year old girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">She was a ballet dancer, a professional ballet dancer from, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> ; and her parents were, in show business too. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And she was beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Even with, with her cropped hair, she was a beautiful, girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So she said, she asked them whether they would want to see, a girl dance ballet — one of her children dance ballet. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">They said, "All right." </span><span class="sentence" id="790">So she asked this girl to, to dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And this girl really, she danced beautifully. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">And, and as she was dancing, you could see tears were running down her cheeks; because she imagined herself, I'm sure, at a time when she was dancing on stage, you know, to the applause of an audience and the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And, and, and I, I just saw that whole scene in my mind because I wrote about her a poem. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And, and then when we got our clothes, they took away this girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">They didn't give her the clothes — I mean, they gave her the clothes back. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">But the SS took her with them; and we never expected to see her again, because if they took somebody out, they usually killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">But a few days later they brought her back, and you couldn't recognize her. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">They had raped her. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">They, they had tortured her. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And she was completely — she wasn't even, all there. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">I'm sure she didn't know what was going on with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">So for the next three days — because only three days was before there was that selection — she, for the next three days she was — I, I was always waking her up — she should come with us and stay between me and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">When, when they were having the roll call, for roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Because if she wouldn't show up, they, they would kill her. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">But then three days later, there was a selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And they selec— she was among them selected. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">From, they selected that time at least more than, more than half. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">From, from the thousand maybe 600 children were, were selected, and she was among those among these girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And, and all of a sudden she tried to remove her to <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="810">Because if she were to ever — it was a reflex, I'm sure, because she knew there was no chance of run— of running out there; because it was only a more horrible death to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">So as, as she would try, as she tried to run over the side where the girls was standing that were not selected, the SS caught her and they beat her to death with the butts of their rifles. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And the screams I couldn't forget for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">That why I always get this in. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">I always get this in. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">I, I always tell about it whenever I speak; because I always feel maybe this child had nobody left, nobody maybe survived because apparently, nobody could — if she was there and, and she was among the children — these were young people, then she was probably the oldest and her whole family probably was wiped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">So I always remember this girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">I always light a candle for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">I wrote a poem about her, and I always tell about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Because her screams, as she was screaming, "Mommy, help me!" </span><span class="sentence" id="820">and "God, help me!" </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And I only was asking God he should — he should take her quickly, that, that it, it should end. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">Because it takes a long time to beat somebody to death, and this — but she was not an isolated case that was beaten to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">The, the things that we have witnessed is, is unbelievable, what human beings can do to other human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">Even animals have a tendency to, to kill only — they would kill only for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">But they killed for pleasure, they could — they for — they would make a sport out, out of, out of us by — they would take, let's say, a girl, and, and have her have bricks — she should stand with bricks in the sun, and, and do all kinds of tortures. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And I will just tell you for what two other girls were beaten to death in front of my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And that was already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nurnberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Yeah, you, you want — I, I will go back first for some....
QUESTION:  First I want to go back to the selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">Would you first tell us what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">After that, after a few months — after this selection, the Blockaltester — and they killed this, when they beat this, child to death — she always was hiding me and my sister after the selections un— 1n, under the covers. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Under, in that one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where she had, where they storaged blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">This was a storage place. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">But then came the day when she told me, "Listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">There are not any more selecting, but they are taking out — they, they don't select any more; but they are taking whole Blocks out, and we don't..." And I said, "So where are they sending?" </span><span class="sentence" id="836">She said, "I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Some go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , and some go for work." </span><span class="sentence" id="838">She said, "Maybe you'll be — ours will be — maybe our <span class="BUILDING">Block</span> will be lucky to go to work." </span><span class="sentence" id="839">But it wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">One day they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">They took out all of us, and we marched, they marched us straight to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I was holding my sister's hand, and I was just thinking, "My sister is getting her wish." </span><span class="sentence" id="843">But I was very, very mad that I am going to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And, and, and I even was so mad that I told myself I'm not even going to make any prayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">I, I was very rebellious about, dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And — but it was so quiet, and it was so, so orderly. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Nobody was, was even crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">I guess we, were so — we, we knew that we haven't got a chance to survive and, and I guess everybody else thought that it doesn't matter sooner or later. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">So if, if it's sooner, it's sooner. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">It mattered a lot to me; but, but — but there was nothing else to do but just be quiet, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And then we, we heard that one, what the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> were not empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">As, as we, were waiting the <span class="DLF">doors</span> to open, nothing was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And after standing there like a half an hour, one SS told the next one, "You, you know, but let's, let's take this, this group — we will take them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nurnberg</span> for work, because we have an order to take the next day." </span><span class="sentence" id="854">They had an order to take the next day a group of people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nurnberg</span> to work in an <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="855">So we'll make a switch. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">We'll take these to work, and the other group we will take to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="857">So, we will just switch around." </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And this is how, how we, were lucky to escape that particular day. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">So we, were given, already had only — the whole time we had only one dress, and under that dress we had no underwear, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">No slip, and nobody was menstruating the whole time that we, were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">So they gave us still one coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">On top of this, this was our, wardrobe: the dress and that one coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And they pushed us in, into another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> ; but we didn't get any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And, and I got very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">I had high fever and I had terrible sores, this like gangrene, in my mouth; and, I must have gotten the fever from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And I was shivering even though I had a coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">And all of a sudden, it was like a miracle that my sister became the one, you know, to realize that I am, that I am very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">So she went over — an SS was eating an apple. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">So she went over and she said, "Please give, give my sister a, a piece of apple. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">She's very sick." </span><span class="sentence" id="871">But he gave her such a slap in the face that she fell all the way to, to where I was lying. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And I just begged her, "Please, don't, don't ever, you..."

QUESTION:  Tell, tell us what happened toward the end of your stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holleischen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="916">ANSWER:  Toward the end of our...in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holleischen</span> — after a few times, you know, taking us to work there — they bombed the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and, and then they would only take us to move stones and clear rubble. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">This was, this was all that we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And, and one day though, they took us to, for potato, to dig out potatoes for the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And, and so we, were also trying to steal a few potatoes; so two girls had put in their pockets potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">We didn't expect that we, that are going to search us, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="921">But I was always very cautious. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">I didn't put in, in my pocket but I had...my coat had a hood. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">So I had a hood, so I put in the tip of my hood two potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And my sister begged me, because she was very much afraid that if I'm caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">So I told her, "Look, don't stay with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">You stay with somebody else." </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Because I, I was afraid that she's going to look at me and, and give me away '' Sudeten District (German) by glancing at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">But ...and we lined up to get in to, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and just before getting in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , two SS, two SS women — there we had only SS women — two SS women started to search; and they found...and these were two sisters...they found potatoes in their pockets. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">They pulled out a potato to, to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And I'm standing just two rows behind those two girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">They beat them, and beat them...the screams...they beat them practically to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">They, they were still alive; and, and they told them if they asked for farm girls, to take one by the, head and one by the feet, to bring them into their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="933">We never saw them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">They finished them off for stealing a couple of raw potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">They beat those poor two girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And now here I am standing, my...my feet are buckling under me because now I, I think to myself, "This...now, now I'm going to be beaten to death." </span><span class="sentence" id="937">They, they tried...they searched me...never, never, you know, luckily it was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">When I came in I was so elated with those potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And we, nobody was really completely normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">Because I felt when I ate those potatoes...I said, "They taste like nuts." </span><span class="sentence" id="941">My sister said, "No, they taste like apple." </span><span class="sentence" id="942">You know, you could, you could imagine every taste.... This was, and I was wondering how come we never ate raw potatoes at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="943">We missed out on so much good food. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">We, we, were...it wasn't, we, weren't normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">So then -- all right, after that I worked with only rubble. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And then when we, went once another — it was very close to our liberation — they, they bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">So we, we had to, we all dropped to the to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> until the bombing was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And then when we got up, there was one of our girls dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And the shame was because it was only a few days before the liberation; and I didn't see no bleeding, no scratch, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">She looked like she was asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">We, we brought her back to, to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and to, for to be buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">And this was the day already that, that the next day they, they locked us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">They didn't take us out, and we, were most surprised that it's very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">That it didn't, you know, nobody came to, to line us up and to take us out to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And we had absolutely no way of knowing what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">We had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">We, we just, we, were very apprehensive; because we felt that something must be going on, because just to let us stay and not getting us, .... just like you say a day's vacation; because they would always take us, even Sundays. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">They would say, "You lazy dogs, you get lazy." </span><span class="sentence" id="959">So they would take us for any excuse, to...to even if just to take stones from here and, and lo— and bring them over to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="960">It was just always a form of, of, punishing us. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">So — and all of a sudden we, we heard, we heard the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , by the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , some noise and then they broke open our.... We, were locked, our...our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was locked from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> with a.... They broke the, the lock, and there were Russian partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And then this was the, the most wonderful day that we, that I could ever remember happening to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And, and then we found out from them how this came about, because if they wouldn't liberate us and, and we would have had to wait for the British — which we did wait for the British because they didn't remain with us; they went to liberate other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And they — and I will tell 1t to you so that you would understand it better — there was one of SS that either wanted to save herself but she was from Czech parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">She was an SS — but a Czech, but married to a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">And for, to how she did it or how this happened that they got, they got they must have — they got word that we are, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp —</span> our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holleischen</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French camp</span> and a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish camp</span> — all the three <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> are going to be burned to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">So this is how they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">They surprised, and the SS were already in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="969">They weren't even anymore in their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , but they came back for lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">They came back for lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">They came back for lunch, and they were going to, torch in the evening the, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And they surprised them while they were having lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">They rounded up those SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">You know, some of them rounded up and some came, broke open the, the <span class="DLF">gates</span> and, and they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">And then when they brought us out into the open, into the in the front and they showed us that how our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was surrounded by wooden logs, logs and it was soaked, it was completely soaked in benzene or gasoline. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">Just, they all, they were just prepared just to light a match to it and we would have all gone on, gone up in flame. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">So what they did is being that they had to go and many other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , you know, to liberate. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">So they told us -- because we, were we, were screaming they shouldn't leave us, they, they should stay with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">They broke open all the food, the stor— storage food where they had all, you know, from the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">Everybody was running to get bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">I was running — I, it was such a fixation in my mind that I ran to the — to the <span class="DLF">potato fields</span> , and I was digging potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">I was digging potatoes to no end. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">My sister, at least, was smart enough to run — and she thought that I that I was also running with, with them — for the bread; but when she came, when she didn't see me she had at least a bread and, and a salami. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">She, she started to look for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">She didn't see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">She came back to the <span class="DLF">field</span> , and there I am staying; I have loads of potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">I said, "Mina, because we will never starve again. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">Look at all the potatoes that I am...." She said, "Look, we don't need potatoes for there is — people are, are having bread and salami." </span><span class="sentence" id="989">I said, I said, "I don't move from here if you if you don't help me bring in all those potatoes." </span><span class="sentence" id="990">She had to, she had to help me bring in those potatoes; because I, I would not move from those potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">This is what — because this was — I have experienced this incident that these girls are beaten to death, and what happened to me when that I have the strength that this 1s all I could think of at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">But anyway, we buried that, that girl that day, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And, and then we, we had to wait for the British to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And so they gave rifles to the French men that they should stand guard, because the French was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">man's camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="995">So they were standing guard, guarding us until the until the British arrived; because they were afraid there could be a pocket of Nazis somewheres and, and come back and still kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">And then when the British arrived and they already opened up, you know, we had to be quarantined for weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">And we, were in terrible shape anyway and we had to learn even how to lead again a normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">I mean, we, we, we could not, we at that time we could not be trusted with anything because our whole mind was, was completely.... You could be the finest and most law-abiding citizen before, but our whole, our, our whole that we experienced, we, were not human. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">We, we could not remain human. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">It took a long time for us to become human again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">Because, for instance — I will give you an example — because this is just really for history to know — that the, they set up a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and, and they asked us all very nicely and, “We will give you food that you can that you should eat that we give you, because your health 1s — 1f not you're not, you're not going to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">You must eat only what we give you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">After we, we ate, and they gave a plate or, or a bowl or whatever — we would take that bowl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">We would try to smuggle out that bowl; because our intention was not to go and, and try and find food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">It wasn't, you know, we couldn't, couldn't imagine that this 1s now this normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">You are going to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And they, they would reason with us: "Look," they said, "you're coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">This is not the only meal you're getting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">You're...." They had to talk to us like little bit stupid children, you know? "</span><span class="sentence" id="1010">You're coming back here." </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">But we still couldn't trust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">We couldn't trust nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">Even for our friends, we couldn't trust; we didn't trust nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">So they had to station themselves, because if, if we take away the bowls they don't have them back to serve us the, the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">They had to station, they had to station two people and, and take away from each one back, back the bowls, that we wouldn't walk out with all the, the bowls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And, and, and even af— and even after that, here I am already liberated and we, were there quite a few weeks until we, were allowed to travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">So my destination was to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and see who remains, that if somebody remains alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">Against all odds, I still — you know, until you are not hundred percent sure, somehow you think some miracle happened and, and even maybe some just cousins remained alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">So we, were traveling in a — so we didn't need any <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">We didn't have any, any money or any currency; but we, we just had a certain pass, and we, we got some, some money from the British. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And — but we could travel all over with, without any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">And so they took us already to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ; and, and we take a — and Pearls and I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and I'm on my way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , there was a, a directorate was giving out sandwiches, was sending out sandwiches. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">And so I went down to get a sandwich, and somebody recognized me — that I am this and this, fiancé. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">Because I meantime got engaged while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> ; and so he tells me that, that — whether I know that Joe is alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">Joe was my fiancé, who, who became right away, very shortly, my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">I said, "No." </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">She said, "All nght." </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">She said, "He's here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">He's also in —” you know, it was like a rehabilitation, “you will be rehabilitating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">But it was a beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">They gave you the best food, and to gather yourself; and, and he will take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">So I run in to my sister and I tell her, "You come with me, because Joe is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">And, and we are going, we are not going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> yet, we are going first, first to, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">And we come there; and, and there as he was taking my name, it's, it's was a colleague of my brother who was, who was — oh, he was so happy; and he asked me about my brother, and tell me he's in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">So he told us that we can stay as long as we want in this in that Charita was the name....
