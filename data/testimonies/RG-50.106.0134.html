<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  You had some experience with butchering?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  No, actually I didn’t, because I was very young whe -- when I left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but my father did have a <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So I had knowledge --

<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  I spoke Yiddish, I spoke Czech, Russian, Hungarian and of course I understood Polish, or a -- I also spoke German, you know, and that helped a lot because a -- when a -- in that part of -- a lot of the -- in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , I should say, there were a lot of ethnic eastern Europeans. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So I more or less had a -- you know, had a way to get by with some of the customers, so that I -- although language was a problem, but my broth -- this William Lebow instead of pe -- speaking to me Yiddish, he spoke to me in English only. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So consequently I was forced to pick up the language a little faster, because everybody spoke to me in English.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  -- or may -- you just --

<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  Is this -- was it first to learn English?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  To learn English basically, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">To learn English, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And then when I used up the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , I went to a couple of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> away there was -- they had a larger <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , they have a little more advanced teaching, so I went over there and got some more English basically, and some other subjects that were whatever I wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But it was also at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">It was all after work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  Did you have any contact during your early period here with Jewish agencies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  No, I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I -- oddly enough, I didn’t have any contact with agencies, I didn’t get any help from agencies. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I didn’t look for it, I didn’t even know whether they existed in -- in some sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But I -- I was completely -- soon as I got here I was completely on my own, which is, by the way, this is the way I wanted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I didn’t want any charity, I didn't want anything from anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  What -- why was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  No particular reason, I just didn’t think of looking f -- to someone else, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Basically that’s all 1 -- I think that’s the way it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  Okay, so here you are in -- working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carteret</span> and going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at night and having meals at your sister’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Right, and so now life took -- took on -- oh yes, in the beginning I did go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> like on weekends, like on Sundays, because that’s -- was the only day I was off and meet some other friends that I got to know, I knew a little, slightly. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And we used to meet on Sunday and go out for dinner or to a movie, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And -- but after --
QUESTION:  How -- how did you get to know them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  Well, some of them I knew -- I don’t know, through the <span class="DLF">grapevine</span> or you know, you know a couple of people, then you would meet another two, three people and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So there was like five, six of us that would meet periodically, and --
QUESTION:  Were a-any of them people that you had known in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  A couple of them were -- I had known in Europe, but some of them I did not --
QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  -- I met here. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And we were -- and the reason being is that -- oh yes, and there was still, on the <span class="REGION">east side</span> there was some kind of a -- from one of the families there was a -- they had like a organization, they would meet once a month or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So I went a couple of times there, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And what [indecipherable] really was, that because you didn’t know anyone, you didn't know the language, so you could have [indecipherable] together. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">But after a very short time, maybe like three months, four months, I somehow decided that that was not for me and that I’m going to try and make fre -- American friends that are local so that I don’t have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So I started more or less -- and I met a couple of Jewish boys in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carteret</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , and we sort of became a little friendly and I went along whether it was to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">beach</span> or for pizza. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And so slowly, slowly I started getting -- and with American kids saw that I’m European. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So I literally -- some [indecipherable] I cut myself off entirely. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Not by design, it just to happened that it -- it worked that way, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And of course I worked a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I de -- delivered groceries, big, big boxes on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , it had one si -- a big basket and a small wheel in the front, and all th- th-the groceries are in big, big boxes. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I was -- and I was only like 16 on -- going on 17 really, and I was pretty light. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So the box were sometimes heavier than I was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">But anyway, I did this for quite awhile, til I started driving. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I was able to drive, you know, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> , which was like a year, a year and a half later. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And I worked, like I mentioned a lot of hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We worked between 60 to 90 hours a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Like I worked six days a week from seven to six and I -- two days a week til nine o’clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And during the night we would go twice a week to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> to pick up vegetables. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So it was like between eight oc -- eight p.m. to maybe we’ ll get back two, three a.m., and the next morning we start all over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So it was qu-quite hectic and I worked like this for a number of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And --
QUESTION:  Thi -- this reminds me of what you said earlier, as a child you worked for your family --
ANSWER:  Yeah, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  -- then you went to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> , then you went to regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , then you went back to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  -- then you worked again for your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">It sounds like a --
ANSWER:  Yeah, we worked all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  -- similar kind of schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Well, th-this was sort of different because a-a-at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in Europe it was different because it was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">It was a relaxed -- 1-1t -- I d -- I don’t know about relaxed, but it was -- it was a different -- the confines were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Here it was strictly a job working, and it was frustrating because I didn’t speak the language, and plus the hours were allow -- they didn’t allow you too much time for anything else, and I did a lot of what I would call really dirty work, okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>

QUESTION:  With no future.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  -- condition -- right, conditions weren’t much different than this today because today you go for a job, an immigrant comes in, it’s much, much different because they come in, the conditions are entirely different. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">In those days you came -- it wasn’t even that somebody was doing something wrong -- like my brother-in-law wasn’t necessarily a mean guy, he was a nice guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">He himself worked hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">His mentality worked 1n that direction, so what I was doing was not out of the ordinary for him, but it was out of the ordinary for me --
QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  -- because like such thing as collecting the dirty garbage with the stinking vegetables, even in Europe I would -- didn’t do that, you know, so it was the kind of a thing for a young boy it was very demeaning, if you will.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  But I still [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">But nevertheless, I was getting paid and I was supporting myself and I remember a f -- I did want to move to <span class="REGION">California</span> originally, that was my plan, and because the job I got sidetracked here. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">In <span class="REGION">California</span> by the way [indecipherable] that time, jobs were unavailable. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So my brother-in-law was there, but he couldn’t get a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">So that reinforced my need to stay here because I was supporting myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  Why did you think that you wanted to go to <span class="REGION">California</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  Well, number one I wanted to live with that particular sister, near -- near her, although I had a good relationship with this sister as well, and she was very selfless. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">But the other one was younger, prob -- closer to my age I should say and we had more -- we grew up together so we had more of a -- a rapport, or whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  This is not the sister you came over -- was this the sister that you came over --

<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  I -- I -- yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And so we had a sort of very good relationship and I -- I would have felt more comfortable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And not that this sister was not good, but I mean she -- she was actually always worried about me and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So -- but she was older and she left and I was like, about nine years old, so just for that reason alone, but otherwise I had equally as good a relationship with Ellen as I did with the other one, with Cindy. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">But as I worked, one thing that I do recall that used to frustrate me, I wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I couldn’t afford to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because I couldn’t quit working. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">So every so often I -- I would get sort of upset about it [indecipherable]|tape break]
QUESTION:  You were talking about wanting to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  Oh yes, however, there were a couple of reasons I couldn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">First of all I -- my preparation wasn’t as good because I left <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when I was pretty young, a-a-after [indecipherable] grade, but -- plus I didn’t -- my English was still very poor and I had no confidence in going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Plus I couldn’t afford to take off from work. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So I soon decided that that was the only thing I could do is work and anyway I worked like this til about -- for my brother-in-law [indecipherable] for about -- til 1952, when I was drafted into the armed services, during the Korean war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  Now, had you become a citizen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  No, oddly enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I was supposed to but somehow they didn’t -- my papers didn’t come through. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So I was drafted into the service without being a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And it’s a very funny thing, I served the whole time in the service and I was not even a citizen, but a -- and being in the service didn’t help my citizenship because it took another while befo -- when I got out of the service, to find out why I didn’t get my citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And of course they gave me some kind of limp excuse that I -- they were investigating me and so on that if I had any communist affiliations. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So I was laughing because at 16 how could I have communist affiliations? </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Nevertheless I -- I did get my citizenship right after that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="211">ANSWER:  A-And the officers’ club. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I was a -- prepared it for them and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So I had a very nice ga -- actually it was a very nice job, I was completely on my own and they liked the job I was doing so they wouldn’t release me to go elsewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And as a matter of fact one time I had a run in one of the lieutenants there, so I was lucky enough, I was -- got myself an order to go to [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and he wouldn’t release me, so I stayed there for the whole time. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">But after that things were rather good. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So I really had a very nice job. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">It was like going to a civilian job every day that I had my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> there and I lived there f -- I was there like for a -- a whole two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And on weekends I was able to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Richmond</span> , and I would go sometime to a -- a Jewish dance or something of -- different things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And we would -- actually, was a very good -- a good two years, cause I got to be in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">QUESTION:  How was it being a Jew in the service?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  I had no problem at all with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I -- you know, I just -- see, I never emphasized or made a big issue of being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I never had a problem [indecipherable] in Europe when I worked with other people, I -- I used to just act normal and I -- I never encountered any -- any prejudices or any problems with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And in fact in the -- in the -- this particular section in the officers’ club, I was the only Jewish person there. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Oh wait, there was another Jewish fellow there for awhile from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , but he -- nobody liked him and eventually, you know, he left from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">But it wasn’t because he was Jewish, he was just not exactly a nice guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And so I really didn't -- didn’t experience any bad like -- you know, bad times because I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And after that, in °52, I -- I had plans to move to <span class="REGION">California</span> finally, just --

QUESTION:  He wasn’t able to find anybody else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  No, he always had -- he -- he’s operated a small business and he was not forward-looking enough that he would expand or get more help. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So --

ANSWER:  Yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  -- he couldn’t hire somebody in your <span class="NPIP">place</span> to do what you did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  Well, he felt I was more capable because by that time he took over another <span class="BUILDING">store</span> from one of his brothers and the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> didn’t do so good, so I -- he felt that I could build it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">So one thing led to another, before you know it, I ended up buying the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> from him, because it --
QUESTION:  Now, how did you get enough money to buy the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  I didn’t, I was paying them off in small amounts and he was pretty generous -- not that the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was worth much, because the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> really was not producing enough income, but --

<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  -- I worked harder and I merchandised, I tried to give good service and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And so whenever I ran the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , things were running smoother than if somebody else ran it. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And -- and eventually my brother-in-law saw -- he sort of talked -- not talked me into it, but he -- they told him it will be a favor and they turned over the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> to me, in a sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And I was --
QUESTION:  Were they doing you a favor --
ANSWER:  Not --
QUESTION:  -- or were they getting rid of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  Well, they were -- they were getting rid of it but they were actually think -- it -- it’s very hard to say because their mentality was geared in certain -- it’s very hard to understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I would not accuse them of not -- of doing it to get rid of it or to -- or -- or for ulterior motives, because they really -- you know, my sister had the best interest for m -- for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And my brother-in-law too was the -- he was not a shady guy, it was straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And I think in their own mind they thought they were doing me a favor, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">But what was happening 1s that the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was just not a place that you could build it up too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I would improve it, but I would not get where I could make a good living out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">In the meantime -- oh yes, in ’56 -- ’57 I got married, and then I realized - not then, I -- I realized before that I have to make a little more of a living, so I worked hard and I tried to make a living and I barely scraped a living out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">It was not a moneymaking proposition. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Well, while I was there, somehow or another I -- by that time I saved some money -- oh, in the meantime [indecipherable] the money that I got -- that I saved, even though I was making very little in the beginning, I saved money from a he -- you know, on a regular basis, but I had -- in 1947 we discovered I had a brother that was in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">We found out that he was alive, so this was a -- th -- actually the Russians kept him two years after the war was over as a prisoner, and they accused him of being a German, so they kept him with the German prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">They didn’t believe that he was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">So when he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they found out he was alive, so a lot of the money that I saved, I spend a lot of money on he -- oh, he made his way to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , because I had another -- a brother living in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> as well, another brother, Mandel. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">He lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liberez</span> and somehow when my brother came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , he found a few Jewish people that were -- remained there alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">One man who -- where -- where my brother lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Sorry.

<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  And your sister, because she was his wife, was she treated like he was, or --
ANSWER:  Oh, no, no, no, no, they -- they were all treated right, but you know it was a kind of a -- the situation was different, the society at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">You had to co -- if you came in from out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> you had to sort of prove to yourself that -- the townspeople thought they had a monopoly on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , something li -- it’s just a sentimentality. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">But I was working in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> there -- once I owned the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and one of the things that was happening to me is that I was not making a lot of money, and -- I backtracked a little -- and I was -- it was getting on my nerves, I was not making a lot of money and I was -- had to deal with a lot of people, they were like Ukrainian or Polish, and they’d come in, I spoke their language, you tried to be nice and they would always accuse you of being a cheat because you were Jewish and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">So there was certain resentment on my part with certain accusation on their part. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And I wasn’t willing to take that garbage because I figured if they don’t like me, too bad, that’s their problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And I just wouldn’t ba -- put it simply, my tolerance level was not very high [indecipherable] treated and anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">So in the meantime, like I say, I’m -- I -- the money wasn’t there and one day I realized that I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I wanted to be an American, I want to act like one, I want to speak like one. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Here I’m spending most of the time with people that don’t speak English and they are illiterate or -- or very poorly educated and I spend every day with these people and all of a sudden I found out that was not what I wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">So I got very mad one day -- this is after spending there seven, eight years, to my regret, I got mad and I said I’m going to close the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , I’m going to move to <span class="REGION">California</span> this time to --
QUESTION:  Yeah, were you married at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">ANSWER:  Oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">QUESTION:  You were married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">ANSWER:  No, I was married, but by that time already my daughter was, let’s see, must have been about four years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And by that time I had a son, Jeffrey, which came later, about a year and a half or- yeah, almost two years after my daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">So, they was both small, Jeffrey must have been like about two years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And I decided I’ve had it with this and I’m not going to live like I’ve lived it -- like if I was in Europe, I want to live in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">So I wanted to get out of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Besides, I saw there was no -- no future there. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So I picked up and I went to <span class="REGION">California</span> with my wife and children, and by that time my other brother that had come out from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> was -- also went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> with the Haganah from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">But eventually we brought him out to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because it was getting too expensive to upkeep him in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , we have to send him money all the time, so we decided to bring him over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">So by that time, that was, I think -- I’m not sure what year it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">But anyway, by that time he was already - we brought him out from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and -- but he also moved to <span class="REGION">California</span> because my sister was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So he settled in <span class="REGION">California</span> , so when I decided to move, he was already living there, plus I had my other sister there. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And when we got there we tried to get an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , but in the meantime I had left a lot of loose ends here in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">So -- because I didn’t empt -- empty out a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">So I had to come back, so I left my wife and my children there, and while I was here settling my affairs, my wife decided she didn’t like it there and she came back -- she got -- hopped on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">So that was --

QUESTION:  And only your stuff was still in <span class="REGION">California</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">ANSWER:  No, and -- right, well we didn’t move per se, you know, we just went physically, ourselves you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">ANSWER:  To find an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">But our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- oh yes, in the meantime, the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that I had bought, I sold, because I was moving in <span class="REGION">California</span> , cause I -- I was so sure we were going to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">But anyway, at the time my wife was a little emotionally upset and so on, because of sh -- after the children, she had a little tough time of it emotionally or mentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So anyway she -- all of a sudden something struck her there, she didn’t like <span class="REGION">California</span> , so she got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">QUESTION:  Did she have family here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">ANSWER:  Yes, she had family here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">QUESTION:  On the <span class="REGION">east coast</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">ANSWER:  Her mother lived here, although her -- her relationship with her mother was not great. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">But her sisters lived here -- no, actually one sister lived here at the time, one sister lived in <span class="REGION">California</span> I think, at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And anyway, she got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and she came back with the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">So once she was back, I didn’t have much of a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">My <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was sold and the business was gone, so I got an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> momentarily and we lived in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And then along came -- one of my lawyers that I knew told me there was this small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> available, and I decided that a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , it wouldn’t cost me much more than the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , even though it was small.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">QUESTION:  Whoops, something happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">ANSWER:  Oh [inaudible]
QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">ANSWER:  Okay, anyway, so on the spur of the moment, instead of staying in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which we did not like, I decided -- I bought this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , it was a little smaller than I would have liked to, but we could afford it. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And it’s what we could afford, so we moved into this small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Colonia</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And the children started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> over there, and we lived there f -- we intended to live there like a couple years and we -- it turned out we lived there like about 10 - 12 years in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , cause my wife didn’t want to move from there, cause she got so used to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">But in the meantime I got a job as soon as I came back, worked f-for again, a s-small s-<span class="BUILDING">supermarket</span> for a shor -- for about couple of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And then I decided to go back and to -- I found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I wanted to open a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And again this time it was very important for me that I open in an <span class="REGION">area</span> where you have Americans, that I deal with regular people rather than like back in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">So I opened this <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madison</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , it was a new <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and I struggled there --
QUESTION:  A -- you opened the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , it was an independent --
ANSWER:  Ah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">QUESTION:  -- <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">ANSWER:  No, it was an independent, actually it was more of a <span class="BUILDING">butcher store</span> , okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">QUESTION:  And you just opened it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">ANSWER:  I just opened it from scratch, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">ANSWER:  I set it up and I opened it, after I worked for this ga -- fellow, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Woodbridge</span> for a couple of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And like I said, this was a new <span class="BUILDING">shopping center</span> , and I opened up, but it was a ups -- coming community. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">So I opened the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> with a little -- in mind with a little hi -- better caliber of customer, and little up -- upscale, and I struggled there for a couple of years, again not making money. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Actually, I was losing money for the first couple of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">But eventually I made it, the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> caught on eventually because from the start it got the good reputation. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And I sit in this particular <span class="BUILDING">store</span> for the next 25 years, while my kids were growing up, I sent them through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">So as far as living in general, you know, we tried to live as normal as possible, as any American would. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">But here, for the first time in my life, the customers spoke English, I spoke English and I felt like it was -- I arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I didn't have to put up with <span class="NPIP">places</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carteret</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">So in that respect I -- 1-it’s sort of like my dream, I guess, of living as an American came true.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">QUESTION:  So you had a really tough period for awhile.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">ANSWER:  Well, 1-1t -- it was tough, I’m sure it was not any tougher than anybody -- but hindsight it doesn’t seem so tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">At the time I -- I -- I remember, because one of the biggest problem was - again, it’s very hard to compare it to -- to 1999 or 2000, is because the amount of money people are making is -- was just entirely different level, you know, it was --- it was true everything was -a-- alot of things were less expensive, but it was very hard to make -- make money and keep it, because things -- things were difficult, especially like in my case, you know, I’m sure that there were a lot of people, i-immigrants like myself had the same problem, nobody helped you period, whether it -- but -- which was okay because I wanted to be self reliant. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">However, 1n some cases people come, they get big wedding gifts, or they get a start here, they gotta push there. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Like I had a friend, he was complaining about his father-in-law [indecipherable], but he would buy him carpeting for the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , or -- or buy him a <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> , or whatever, were -- were -- or -- or turned over the business to him, whatever, I didn’t have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">So it was 1-in a sense struggle. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">On the other hand, why should I look for some -- someone else to give it to me, you know, it’s simple as -- as far as I’m concerned, it’s okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">But it was tough, because the amount of money you made or you’ve been able to keep was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And in that respect, I guess it was tough, but I imagine that most people had -- didn’t have it much different.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">QUESTION:  So now your're retired?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  And how did you decide to retire?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  Well again, I was in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and we -- I was there like 25 years and the real estate -- the <span class="BUILDING">shopping center</span> was sold to another company and the first thing the new company came in, they took over, they wanted to triple my rent, which I could -- definitely could not afford. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And by now the business also was suffering, cause I was in the meat business and the cholesterol thing came on very quickly, very strong, and all of a sudden the demand, plus the competition was just too much to -- to absorb, because the demand just dropped, and -- while the competition was increasing. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">I was in an <span class="REGION">area</span> , it was a very competitive <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">There was like four or five <span class="BUILDING">supermarkets</span> within a couple of miles of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">But for the longest time I held out, but with a reduction of meat consumption, it was going down. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So then when the new landlord came in, and he demanded almost triple rent, plus extra added expenses, I just felt I couldn’t afford to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">So I retired prematurely; I really wanted to stay in business another four or five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And- so once -- which worried me, because I didn’t think I could afford it economically. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">But somehow or another, once I saw that I had to go, I made the best of it and so far so good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">QUESTION:  So you had worked very hard all your life, from the time --
ANSWER:  Oh yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  -- even as a small boy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  What was it like for you suddenly to not have to --
ANSWER:  Well --
QUESTION:  -- not be working any more?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  -- I thought I would have a problem with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">As it turns out I don’t have a -- I -- I adjusted very easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I amazed myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I will say -- after I retired, I did, when I got out of business, I did go part time. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I worked for a <span class="BUILDING">supermarket</span> in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> for -- periodically. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And when I didn’t work there I worked someplace else, couple of -- two or three days a week or so, and now that I moved here actually, I’m also doing -- basically still doing the same thing, I’m working a little bit, part time and then I volunteer and I do things. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I’m not bored.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  Now, what -- what work do you do part time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">ANSWER:  Actually, right now I work -- I do some consulting, like for the food industry, like <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> and sup -- <span class="BUILDING">food stores</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">QUESTION:  Like, for example, how -- how would that work? </span><span class="sentence" id="441">A client comes --
ANSWER:  Well, like somebody wants to set up a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , so I help them set it up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">QUESTION:  And how do they found you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">ANSWER:  Well, I find them, really --
QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">ANSWER:  -- most of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Because when I came here I -- it took a long -- I did some of it in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , but when I came here I didn't know the <span class="REGION">area</span> , I didn’t know where to start. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">So it’s a little - I didn’t depend on it too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So I started working actually one day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katz</span> ’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Here I walked in one day and he asked me if I could help him out, I got to talk to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And I started helping him out, I’m still there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">QUESTION:  Wh-Where is this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">ANSWER:  <span class="BUILDING">Katz’s market</span> in -- a <span class="BUILDING">kosher market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="452">So I’m there -- whenever I want to work, I ge -- he and I have an arrangement, when I -- if I want to work, I work and if I don’t, I don’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  And when you want to work, what -- what does ti --
ANSWER:  So I go in --
QUESTION:  What work do you do when you want to --
ANSWER:  I work in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">service counter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Th-Th -- they sell meat, you know, so I --
QUESTION:  Okay
ANSWER:  -- do service. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">So I put in like three days a week on average, two or three days a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And what’s nice about it, I -- I am not committed where I have to, you know, I -- I work -- whenever I’m free, I work. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So this way I could do what I want to do, still I work a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">QUESTION:  And you said you do volunteer work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">ANSWER:  I volunteer in the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">QUESTION:  Now, how did you happen to volunteer there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">ANSWER:  What happened 1s that I had -- in the beginning when I first moved here I had a hard time to even go into the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , by the way, it took me like two or three years prior to -- that I went in. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">It took me three years just to get in the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">But when I moved here, I kept on meeting people and they were telling me -- and once I walked into the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , I realized that once I broke the <span class="DLF">barrier</span> and I was able to walk in there that I would like to volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Because I was thinking prior to this to volunteer in other <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , like in the <span class="BUILDING">Smithsonian</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">But when I got familiar with the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , I decided to volunteer there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">QUESTION:  And why did you decide to volunteer there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  Well, I figured that just for the sake of enlightening, like people that come in or whatever, to make them understand certain things what they saw, something like that, something [indecipherable |
QUESTION:  What did you want them to understand?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">ANSWER:  Oh, they’Il un-understand, instead of just seeing pictures, or just seeing -- to give them a little more meaning to it if -- if -- if I had the chance that -- to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Cause sometime you look at pictures or you read something, it’s one thing, but then sometime when another person sort of co-conveys a little explanation to you, maybe you got a little better insight of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION:  Well, like what insight did you want them to have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">ANSWER:  Well, like understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">QUESTION:  What did you want them to take away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">ANSWER:  Well, I want them to take away more or less the -- how precarious freedom can be. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Basically, this is the way I see things, that 1f you don’t know what dangers lie, you’re not careful to protect what you have. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">If you -- th-that freedom is something you don’t take for granted. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">That -- it’s something that you have to you know, that you have to be aware of what’s out there and not to allow yourself to be caught in it, basically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">QUESTION:  And what do you do at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  Well, this past two years, actually, I was taking young kids through the “Daniel’s Story,” okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">N-Now this year I’m going to go and -- in fact they’re going to have a training course for older kids, like in the <span class="BUILDING">permanent museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So I’m gonna volunteer in there, I think, also.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">QUESTION:  And you take people through, you mean you explain --
ANSWER:  Yeah, it -- it -- it --
QUESTION:  -- you actually explain --
ANSWER:  -- yeah, explain it, you know --
QUESTION:  -- things as [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  -- like in the “Daniel’s Story,” it’s for the younger children, that’s four to seven graders. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">So we take them through and we explain to them, we try to give them a certain understanding at their level. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And oddly enough, in some cases I think it does a lot of good, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">QUESTION:  So you -- you feel that they are receptive --
ANSWER:  Yes, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">QUESTION:  -- that they can understand --
ANSWER:  Right, right --
QUESTION:  -- and they’re interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">ANSWER:  -- right. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And I -- and I’ve also seen, from different aspects -- in fact, my daughter is on the board of -- in the ADL and I’ve ga -- and they have programs that are also sometimes in conjunction with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And they started a program, they train teachers, the Catholic diocese of the <span class="REGION">Washington area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And I’ve seen what they did -- what they’re doing in the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic schools</span> is just phenomenal. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And I -- I feel that when you get it out there, if you got people that cooperate and they educate and they give them exposure that you get these kids that make -- grow up to be anti -- very big anti-Semites, that they get it from education of certain -- they get certain information that I may -- they will not get at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but they get it in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , like in the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> an -- at that, that each time you in -- you inject people like this with a little knowledge, that sooner or later it helps someplace else as they grow up. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">You know what’s - even if they have a background of anti-Semitism, they already -- they got it in their own <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , through good teachers, which I’ve seen some of them are very, very capable. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">So this is the kind of stuff, that’s one of the reasons I feel that it’s very important to reach them. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And a lot of the kids we get in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , many times you think of Jewish kids, actually we get kids from <span class="REGION">Carolinas</span> , from <span class="REGION">Oklahoma</span> and from that -- kids that never heard of Jews, or -- or never had any - you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">So this way it gives them, instead of thinking of a Jew as a Jew, they think of Jew as person that went through a bad experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And -- and maybe some of them will understand some of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">So in that respect I think it’s -- it’s a very good thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">QUESTION:  When we met a week or so ago, I thought you had said that you worked in the speaker’s bureau?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, I forgot, okay, I do that too, right, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">QUESTION:  What do you do there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">ANSWER:  Well, in there I -- I speak before groups, every so often, just about my experience, basically. [</span><span class="sentence" id="501">-It’s geared mostly to an individual’s experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">QUESTION:  And how is that for you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">ANSWER:  Well, at this age it’s okay, it’s a -- each time it’s a little difficult because it’s very emotional. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">But in the same time I feel that again, if people hear it, if somebody comes up with denials and they hear it from somebody like me that I went through it, all of a sudden th-they -- when a -- a denier denies, they may not buy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And then -- so in that respect I think it’s -- as a matter of fact, just recently I spoke to the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> itself, and we had a full hou -- the whole <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> was full, actually standing room only. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And I could not believe the amount of people that came -- came up to me and they were just, you know, genuinely touched and -- and they were [phone ringing| Excuse me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION:  Okay, we’ll turn it off. [</span><span class="sentence" id="508">tape break] You were talking about speaking at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> recently and people coming up to you afterward.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">ANSWER:  Oh yes, and it -- it was very, you know, I don’t know, how can I put it? </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I -- I was very surprised and -- because people came up and they actually [indecipherable] and asked for -- even for an autograph, you know, they were like very taken wi -- and the response was just fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And you have to remember, most of these people -- not most -- if not all of them were -- like probably 90 percent of them were not Jewish, you know, and they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">So when you see it makes an impact like that it gives you an idea that it -- it’s the thing to do, you know, to -- to make -- because th -- fa -- just for no other reason, just the fact that this way they could say gee, I met someone, so who 1s this guy denying that this happened when it did happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I met someone that did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">QUESTION:  Really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">ANSWER:  So that respect I think it -- it serves a big purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">QUESTION:  You’ve -- you’ve done a lot of being interviewed, not only the speaking that you do, but for the <span class="BUILDING">Wiesenthal Center</span> , for the Shoah Foundation and now today. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">How is that for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="518">What is that like for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">ANSWER:  Well, a-at this stage 1-it’s still -- every time I give an interview 1-1t’s still difficult for some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> you just get very emotional. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">But the only reason I did it is because everybody says it’s important for -- for the history, so when I was in <span class="REGION">California</span> a few years ago, I -- you know, I did it because some -- for the same reason, and the same reason here. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And I just feel that if there’s enough information out there that the deniers will have less chance of denying, basically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Can we go back? </span><span class="sentence" id="525">You mentioned that you had two children, but what was it like for you when your childr -- when your first child was born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">ANSWER:  For me it was like probably the nicest thing that ever happened to me. ... </span><span class="sentence" id="527">When my daughter was born, I -- it actually changed my life and gave me more purpose if anything, and it was just one of the nicest things probably in my whole entire life. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And -- and then of course my son came, so it, you know, iv -- 1t was just -- I enjoyed my kids from the time they were born. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I -- I could honestly say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I’m very fortunate in that regard. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">As a matter of fact, yesterday was our anniversary, our 44" anniversary. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">So my daughter made dinner and I can honestly say -- she is like 40 -- 42 years old, I think, and I had nothing but pleasure from her, so -- and now she has two children and it -- it’s like I’m getting it all over again, so it’s really very, very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Now, my son got married and he -- he’s also married a very nice woman and she 1s like -- like my daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And they have a -- a little boy now, Joshua. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And so in that regard I think that between my children, my grandchildren, it’s probably the crowning of my life, if you will.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">QUESTION:  You mentioned that you moved to this <span class="REGION">area</span> about five years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">ANSWER:  Yes, five years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">QUESTION:  And how did you decide to move to this <span class="REGION">area</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  Well, once I ga -- gave up the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , it was a matter of -- of I could not live where I was, because I liked it there too, but it was a matter of moving into a <span class="BUILDING">senior citizen complex</span> or <span class="REGION">Florida</span> or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And then I realized that I would rather live near my daughter so I could watch my grandchildren grow up. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">So that was a easy decision, and it was a good decision because I really - and I didn't want to go out and live in a <span class="BUILDING">senior citizen complex</span> because I really didn’t want to go out to <span class="DLF">pasture</span> , I want to live among the living, that life goes on. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And so basically I got what I wanted, you -- you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">So I -- I really made the right decision, as far as I’m concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">QUESTION:  I also wanted to ask you about your religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">You talked about that some when I was here a couple of weeks ago, but I wonder if you would talk about that on the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">You took -- you -- I saw in the -- one of the tapes that you -- your family growing up was very observant and Orthodox and that you went to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> , you were Bar Mitzvahed, and then you were -- the Holocaust came along, and then what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">ANSWER:  Yes, I, as far as religion, I guess I’m not what I would call religious, per se. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I’m more nonsectarian if you will, in some respects. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Yet, Iam very Jewish , or I did [indecipherable] I wou- did grow up, it seemed like when I -- where I grew up, everybody was Orthodox and everybody was observant, period. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">There it was a given, you were Jewish, you were brought up somewhat -- most people were -- were Orthodox and -- and observant, especially in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but most people were. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> you found some people that were maybe wavering a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">But I have to ad -- say, we got in -- when we got into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , I remember the first holiday right a -- we came -- actually, we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and I remember we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , this was like about a week after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> actually, a week or te -- to two weeks after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and it was [indecipherable] because -- I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And my father, my uncle, and whoever, you know, the oldest got together in a huddle and tried to say the prayers as much as -- most of them knew it by heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And somehow [indecipherable] right there and then, I sort of like couldn’t fake it, I just -- I just -- I just couldn’t see it, because of what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And from there on in I was not religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I literally, in the beginning, I guess it used to bother me, but after awhile you just learn to live with it and I -- I just never got -- I never thought of religion as -- as an important part of my life, that’s what I’m saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And when I lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> for a short time after the war, there was no o-organized <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> or anything that I recall a-at the time, and the government or the -- basically the whole population in general in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was not exactly a religious type of country like in some <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And wherever you went, on papers you have to fill out, we put out atheist fa -- because it was easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">If you put on -- like in Europe you have to put on Jewish, or religion on a -- on application. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And we chose atheist for one simple reason, because if some clerk would get ahold of your paper, if you said Jewish he probably wouldn’t pass it. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">If it was atheist he would pass it, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And --
QUESTION:  Now this -- you said we, this is?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">ANSWER:  Like in general -- ge -- a lot of Jewish people in we --
QUESTION:  Like your sister, and --
ANSWER:  -- yeah, wa -- like a lot of Jewish in general. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And it was -- religion was not part of your daily life. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And -- and then, of course, when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> I had to work Saturday right from the start and it so -- it so --
QUESTION:  And that -- you were working for a Jew in a <span class="BUILDING">kosher store</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  Oh no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">You mean here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">ANSWER:  No, no, I never worked -- no, this was a non-kosher business. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I never worked in a <span class="BUILDING">kosher store</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">No, this was my brother-in-law had a non-kosher --
QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">ANSWER:  -- it was a -- a regular <span class="BUILDING">store</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">QUESTION:  But he worked on Saturdays.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">ANSWER:  He worked on Saturdays. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And my brother-in-law [indecipherable] was really very agnostic, he -- he just was not into religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">He was very smart, very well read person, but he was not religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">But he was also very well learned in religion that -- the funniest thing, cause it was -- he was -- he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yeshiva</span> and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">But he -- he was definitely not religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">As a matter of fact he was -- and I have to admit, I sort of went along the same -- same route, because I worked Saturdays. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And religion to me wasn’t something that I had a need for, and I still don’t [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">So I’m -- I -- I -- now I go to services and I do go because of my grandchildren and I want to belong, so I sort of -- but I’m not a very religious person, per se. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">However I live, I think in life I practice most of the Jewish teachings or -- or live my life as -- as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I never denied being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I never went around with a thing on the lapel like some people to -- to prove that I’m Jewish, I don’t have to prove anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">So I never had that -- but o-otherwise my thinking is also more on a nonsectarian level in some respects, like politically I -- I am liberal, I guess you would say, politically. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">But I am conservative maybe in some <span class="REGION">areas</span> , you know, and I guess Jews may be, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">So I’m not exactly -- but some -- but religion really doesn’t play, or never played a big part in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">In other words, I looked at religion more of a -- as a crutch woulds -- like someone -- I see some people do and I didn’t want crutches. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">So this is my way of explaining it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="593">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">QUESTION:  We do have to turn over the tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A
QUESTION:  This is tape two, side A, Martin Weiss. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I -- I want to ask you what you think about some contemporary things, like recently Joseph Lieberman was nominated to be vice president on the democratic ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">How -- how did you feel about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="599">ANSWER:  Well, I -- I feel good about it, however, I have a little problem with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I -- I like the idea that he was chosen, and I respect him, definitely, because I think he’s a capable guy, not because he’s Jewish necessarily, but he has a certain -- he has a good character. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">But I think they overplayed a little too much, they made a -- a lot to -- too much to do with -- the press in particular, about him being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And I think sometimes the Jewish community made a big thing to know about him being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And I have a think on this that all things considered, that he’s Jewish, we know this and a -- but he is -- more, he is running as a citizen of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , not as a Jew, so they shouldn’t make such a big issue of him being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">In other words it shouldn’t be -- like if this was in 1900 and they were making a big to-do about him being Jewish, it’s one thing, but you’re talking about 2000, where I think the citizens should be -- he’s a citizen of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">So he -- is he running as a Jew, or 1s he running as a citizen? </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And I think they’re making too much of it, the fact that he is Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And I have to admit, I have mixed feelings because when Jimmy Carter ran, one thing I didn’t like about him 1s because of his religion, because he was a born again. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And I thought that was -- like it clouded his thinking in terms of decision making, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So I should apply the same thing to hi -- to Lieberman. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">However, whether it’s my own prejudice or what, I think Lieberman is more based -- how can I put it? </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Grounded, if you will, and Jimmy Carter was more emotionally born again, but -- where Lieberman is more of a -- has a good character, plus he is jew -- he is Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">So maybe there 1s a difference in how I see it, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="613">But I don’t like when they stress the Jewish part to the point where they already did. [</span><span class="sentence" id="614">inaudible]
QUESTION:  There have been some portrayals of the Holocaust in movies recently, such as “Schindler’s List,” and there was one, “Life Can Be Beautiful.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">ANSWER:  Yes, I saw both of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">QUESTION:  Yeah, what -- what do you think of like --
ANSWER:  Well, I -- I -- I really thought they were both very good. “</span><span class="sentence" id="617">Schindler’s List” of course, was in a different -- on a different level. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I think “Schindler’s List” I think was fantastic, and it didn’t color anything, it gave it a picture from the raw, like -- like it -- not that I was in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> or had the same experience, but it was -- 1-1t was rather -- rather well done in the sense to give the portrayal of -- of what’s -- how things were at the time, or how a soldier behaved, or how -- you know, different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">As far as the Schindler story itself, Pll be honest with you, I never heard of it before the movie came about, I never heard of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">So from my vantage point I never believed something like this could happen in -- in reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Evidently it did, so I -- you know, for me it was a -- you know, something almost hard to believe on the beginning, you know, until it was well documented, that there was a German that was -- that would do something like he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">But the movie itself, the portrayal and the circumstances of the inmates and th -- and -- versus the officer and the -- and the part and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">It -- it really gave it a -- a pretty good picture of a -- what life was like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">QUESTION:  And what about the other one, is it life --
ANSWER:  Oh, “Life is Beautiful.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">ANSWER:  That one I liked too. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">At first I wasn’t sure I'd like it because it was a comedy, how can you make a comedy out of it? </span><span class="sentence" id="628">But all in all I thought it was really a very, very good movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Very, very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I -- I thought it was just very clever and in spite of they tried to make other movies something similar, I don’t think they came even close. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">This -- this one here I think was very unique for this type of movie.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">QUESTION:  Did you feel it was realistic, or --
ANSWER:  No, no, definitely was not realistic, but -- but it was --
QUESTION:  What -- what did you like about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">ANSWER:  Well, it’s --
QUESTION:  I didn’t see the movie, I know what it’s about, but I didn’t see it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">ANSWER:  I -- I saw it awhile ago, so I don’t remember exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">But I liked about it because it -- it sort of conveyed a certain ca -- comedy -- a -- a sort of comical part of life, in a sense, from a satirical point of view, or something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">I think it has a certain satire that -- that was very illuminating as -- to some extent, sort of on a human nature, of a psyche, whatever, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So in that respect I thought it was a very good movie, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">ANSWER:  There was one movie [indecipherable] talking about movies that I saw recently that I really thought it was very good also. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Maybe not quite as [indecipherable] but that was “Sunshine”, I don’t know if you heard of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">QUESTION:  I did hear about it and it was highly recommended to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">ANSWER:  And it really was one of the movies that -- the reason I thought it was very good is because it dealt with the subject of assimilation, which I found very unique to Hungarian Jews, to a lot of --
QUESTION:  Unique to Hungarians?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="643">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And a -- to Hungarian Jews because they tried very hard to assimilate and very har -- tried to be very like -- almost like a intelligentsia type persona. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">You know, it -- it tried to take on that -- that Germanic mantle, if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">In -- in the -- <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> it’s very similar in the -- in the class system and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Which I was viol [indecipherable] always very violently opposed to, you know, from my point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And --
QUESTION:  You were violently opposed to --
ANSWER:  Opposed to that Hungarian Jewish mentality, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">QUESTION:  Oh, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">ANSWER:  And one of the reasons that I thought it was good is because of the -- it deals with the subject of assimilation and a lot of Hungarian Jews were -- because of you did have a class system on <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and so everybody tried to make sure they act like they were very fancy, or very uppity. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And I remember even as a kid I used to find it very, very bothersome to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And when I saw Hungarian, a lot of Hungarian Jews, not all, a lot of Hungarian Jews, even during the war, a lot of the Hungarians were -- punished them because they were Jewish, and they were doing things to them that they were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">They would always [indecipherable] breast that they’re royal Hungarians, okay, and I found that very, very disgusting to -- 1f you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">If somebody beats me I’m not going to say I love you, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And basically this deals with that type of subject, you know, it’s -- it’s a very -- you have to understand that, the -- like in the context, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And I found it very amusing that somebody had enough sense to make a movie like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And that’s about as closest to what I think, the way I understood things, that -- that -- you know, this shows it for what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">That if you are persecuted and somebody berates you because you’re Jewish, you don’t join them and become one of them because he doesn’t like you to be Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">Instead you tell him to go to <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , you know, where I come from, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">In fact during -- even in the camps, I -- I recall, a lot of the Polish Jews -- like we always had markings where we came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Like I -- even though I was from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> [indecipherable] we were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="662">We were not from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">So we had a mark that we came from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , a U for Ungar. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And the Polish Jews used to hate Hungarian Jews, okay, and one of the reasons was, believe it or not, for that reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And I was [indecipherable] when I lived among the Hungarian Jews and I moved -- and I went from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , I was -- lived on <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">But I had the same resentment to them, for that reason, because they always insisted what good Hungarians they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And me, as a Jew, I don’t care where I am, if a -- a Ukrainian doesn’t like me, I’m not going to say I love you, I’ll hate him back. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">So, you know, that’s my take on it, for what it’s worth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="669">QUESTION:  So you thought that was a good portrayal of --
ANSWER:  Yes, it was very good portrayal, a really [indecipherable] very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">It tells like of three generations, and could have had some different ways that I saw things, but nevertheless it -- it really hit the mark. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I thought 1t was very good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="672">QUESTION:  Well, I don’t have any more questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Do you have anything that you would like to say, or can you think of anything that I neglected to ask?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="674">ANSWER:  No, I -- I did -- I think you covered it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I would just like to say that by and large most of us were lucky to come, make a life in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S</span> .. And things -- all things considered, things have changed in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I remember when I came there were a lot of things I didn't understand about -- there was Jim Crow and a lot of other things I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I used to go to <span class="BUILDING">night school</span> , I used to ask, and I could never understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">But all things considered, that things have improved, and they’re improving constantly with civil rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">So I really think I’m fortunate that I’m here. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And I think probably most people that came from Europe the time I came would probably -- probably endorse that. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And that is going to be all that I have to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I think it’s -- and life is good if you -- as long as you stay healthy.</span></p>
