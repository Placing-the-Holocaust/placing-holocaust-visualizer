<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  I can't think of any that bothered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Most all my training came easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I tried to stay out of trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">One of the fears was if you were caught in a lie or doing something, they would wash youout. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">You just never wanted to do anything that was not proper. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">We were trained to be officers and gentlemen —

<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">At least I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">But in the thing they told us to look to your right and look to your left, one of you are going to get washed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">The washout rate was fairly high.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  Did that prove to be true?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">A lot of the cadets were washed out early. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">They couldn't meet the academic standards or did some infraction or something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  Where did they go when they were washed out? </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Do you know?</span></p>

QUESTION:  You finish up at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Avon</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">QUESTION:  Now what happens?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">ANSWER:  Then I went to basic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">QUESTION:  Where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Macon</span> -- no -- yeah, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Macon</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Georgia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Yeah, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Macon</span> , <span class="REGION">Georgia</span> , for basic air training. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Primary training in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> , then basic training. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And got abigger <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Ithad more things about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">It was a low- wing monoplane, aclosed <span class="INT_SPACE">cockpit</span> versus being in an open cockpitaircraft. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Still had a-- I don't think [hada --Ithink [had an Army Air Force instructor. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And, again, it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> that was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">We had, I think, a two-speed propeller. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">There were more controls on it. [</span><span class="sentence" id="244">think we had flaps. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">It was alow- wing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">monoplane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">A lot more horsepower than the primary <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trainer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And, again, we went through the same procedures of landings, take-offs, short field landings. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Just learning the basics with amore powerful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">QUESTION:  What was that step-up like, to step up from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bi-plane</span> into that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">monoplane</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Was it a huge experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">It was more powerful and you were enclosed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cockpit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">You had more controls. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">It was -- it was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">You thought you were on your way to being agreat pilot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  You enjoyed it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">ANSWER:  Tenjoyed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Ienjoyed flying very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">QUESTION:  You finish up there, then what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">ANSWER:  Then I went to advanced training.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">| Where was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">ANSWER:  I think I went to (?</span><span class="sentence" id="264">Molta?), </span><span class="sentence" id="265"><span class="COUNTRY">Georgia</span> -- I think one was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Macon</span> -- did I say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Macon</span> ”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  Yes, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Macon</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  Macon, and then I went to (?</span><span class="sentence" id="268">Molta?), </span><span class="sentence" id="269"><span class="COUNTRY">Georgia</span> , and we flew AT-6s, which was the Texan -- had anickname, "the Texan." </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Again, more advanced, more controls, retractable gear. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">We had flaps. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">We had -- each one became a little bit more of achallenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">But it was not like learning everything at once. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">From primary to basic to advanced, each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> was a little bit morecomplex.</span><span class="sentence" id="275">And we did -- I think it was the first time I did anight flight. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Up to that we had never done any night flying. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And in all these <span class="BUILDING">flying schools</span> we did all kinds of manoeuvres. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">We learned instrument flying. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Put a-- hada hood put over our heads so we see nothing but thecontrols in front of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And the instructor was still with us, he could see what we were doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So we learned instrument flying where you've got to rely on your instruments. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">You can get very disoriented. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">If you do some manoeuvres, your ear kicks off and you -- sometimes you can't see anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">You don't know if you're right side up, sideways, you don't know if you're losingaltitude or gaining altitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So each step along the way became more complex.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">QUESTION:  Was it frightening? </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Flying blind, you know, with that hood over?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">ANSWER:  It -- I didn't find it difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">We had some time in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Link Trainers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Do you know what a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Link Trainer</span> is?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Link Trainer</span> is a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> that's in a stationary position where I'm in there, you'retelling me what to do, and you have a_ showing me what I'm doing in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">It's away to learn blind flying without being in an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">He'd basically tell you what to do and you'd do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And you're just looking at -- you got to rely on instruments, you can't rely on your ear andstuff like that when you're learning to fly. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">You got to believe the altimeter, the artificial horizon, the RPMs that the motor's -- you got to rely on your instruments because you can't always see the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">QUESTION:  So throughout this entire process from basic training, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Avon</span> , to going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Macon</span> , to going on to the AT-6, blind cockpit training, what haveyou, what length of time are we talking abouthere, this entire time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">ANSWER:  Two-month intervals.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">QUESTION:  They're cramming a lot into ashort period of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I went from not flying to six months later I'm a pilot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">All our training was in two-month intervals.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">QUESTION:  Up to and through the AT-6 training, 1s there any training involving combat engagement up tothat point or is it purely flying at that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">ANSWER:  At advance training we did some aerial gunnery. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that towed a big target and we shot at that. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">We had to be fairly proficient because they'd count the <span class="DLF">holes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Anumber of us would be shooting at -- the AT-6 was the first aircraftthat we had a gun, and our ammo was painted, the projectile. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So if we shot at the target, as it went through the screen it left yellow or red, so that when you dropped the target you could seewhat your proficiency was in aerial gunnery.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">So we did that in advanced training. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Advanced training was the first time we flew acombat-type <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Part of our training was _ to go down to <span class="DLF">Avon Field</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> , and they had P-40s and we flew a P-40. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">That's the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> I ever flew with no dual time. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Just sat in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> , looked where all the instruments were and took it off.</span><span class="sentence" id="322">No training whatsoever on -- the P-40 was the old war hawk that was_ used, basically, in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">A very powerful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> but sort of obsolete by World War II standards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="324">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">QUESTION:  But, still, what was that first experience like, getting into that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">P-40</span> , no real exposure to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> before, going up in it, what was the --
ANSWER:  It was scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Because when you put the throttle forward, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> moved and it was very manoeuvrable, but -- I don't know, it was exiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">It got your blood going like mad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">QUESTION:  At what point during your training did you realise that you had been slotted and selected specifically for fighter pilot training?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">ANSWER:  Oh, it was in the very beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I knew when I started flying that -- well, probably basically at advanced they made up their mind you were capable of being acombat pilot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">QUESTION:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">How long did you spend with the P-40?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">ANSWER:  Probably less than 10 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">QUESTION:  And then on to what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">ANSWER:  Then Icame <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on _ leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">At that point I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">flight school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Igot my wings. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">My wife came down, pinned my wings on me.</span><span class="sentence" id="345">I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for 30 days leave and was asecond lieutenant, single engine pilot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">QUESTION:  What month, what year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">ANSWER:  August '43.</span></p>

QUESTION:  What happens after your leave is expired and you have to report back? </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Where do you go? </span><span class="sentence" id="353">What do you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  I went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tallahassee</span> , <span class="REGION">Florida</span> and learned I was going to fly P-47s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION:  What did you think?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">ANSWER:  Oh, it was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Imean this was a_ big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">It was -- it had more horses behind that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">propeller</span> , 2800 horsepower. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">It was a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">QUESTION:  Were you thrilled?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">ANSWER:  Oh, it was great. [</span><span class="sentence" id="362">mean we were just hot pilots --
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">ANSWER:  -- you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">QUESTION:  Do you remember the first flight? </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Do you remember getting in the first time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">It seemed pretty natural. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Because I had flown the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">P-40</span> , which was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fighter aircraft</span> but sort of obsolete. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tallahassee</span> -- and, again, it's a single enginefighter, there's no dual time. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">You sit in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cockpit</span> , you learn where all the instruments are, you know where all the controls are to pick up the wheels, the flaps and everything you need to know, and just go ahead and fly it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">QUESTION:  How much training did you have with the P-47?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">ANSWER:  None.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">QUESTION: None. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">You just -- that's it, you were in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">ANSWER:  That's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">QUESTION:  From the time that you were first exposed to the P-47 to then deployment to Europe, presumably, how long was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  Oh, golly. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">I was flying the P-47 in November, I went overseas in December. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">So [had maybe two months training in the P-47 before I went overseas.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">QUESTION:  How did you get <span class="NPIP">overseas</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">ANSWER: <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ"> Ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Boat</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="385">QUESTION:  Where did you arrive in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">ANSWER:  Well, first of all, after I finished my training in the P-47 -- well, my wife and I got married then. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I mean we were married in November. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And one night I didn't come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for dinner and she knew I was going out. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Inever said good-bye to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">My gear was all at the base and they closed down the base. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and she's sitting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tallahassee</span> waiting for me to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And she knew I was going overseas because all my gear was on the base, so...
QUESTION:  Were you trying to spare her the pain of separation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">ANSWER:  No, she knew I was going to leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">ANSWER:  I mean I think during World War II all the wives knew that their -- in the air corp --were going to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">They didn't know when, but it's going to happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION:  Sure, but why did you choose to do it in that fashion, not come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for dinner that night?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">ANSWER:  I felt bad because I couldn't say good-bye to her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">ANSWER:  I couldn't make aphone call. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">They just closed down the base, put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we were on our way to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  So it really wasn't your choice, you were sort of --
ANSWER:  It was not our choice, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I didn't know if I was going to go to eastern -- or to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">QUESTION:  How did you explain it to your wife? </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Did you write her a letter?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">ANSWER:  Eventually I let her know, when I got to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and could write. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Communication was bad during World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">It took along time. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">She really hardly ever got your letter because if youwrote your wife it was photographed, 16 mm film, went back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , and it was printed out on what they call V- Mail, have you heard of V-Mail?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  Absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  So she gets a little 4x 6 copy of the letter that you wrote, so...
QUESTION:  That was so that the sensors could have a look at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">They looked at it, it was photographed, blocked out any reference to where you were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and she'd get a little photocopy of your letters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">QUESTION:  How long did it take you to get to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  I think it took probably seven days or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">It was aslow trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Went over by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="420">think it was the EMPRESS OF <span class="COUNTRY">AUSTRALIA</span> or something likethat. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">It was pretty nice ride over because as officers we had anice stateroom, we ate ina nice <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> , we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , we had tablecloths. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And it was atroop <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and alot of the troops were down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hold</span> under terrible conditions, I thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I found that being an officer had alot of privileges. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">It was amazing, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="425">QUESTION:  Where precisely in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> did you land?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">ANSWER:  I landed, actually, in <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I think we landed at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="480">ANSWER:  Whatever the mission was. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">First of all, when Ijoined the 350th, that was in January, I really didn't get to fly my first mission until almost March because this fighter group wanted to train new recruits on how they did things, how they flew formation, how they attacked something and just what they did, so you were comfortable and didn't run into each other in combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">So --
QUESTION:  And what was that few months like for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">ANSWER:  It was fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">It was good training. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">We did some dog fighting, we chased each other, tried to evade. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Just to learn how to do stuff as this group did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So -- and after that then I flew first mission.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">QUESTION:  And what -- I want you to tell me all about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">What was the first mission like? </span><span class="sentence" id="490">When was it, precisely?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">ANSWER:  The first mission, if I recall -- I went overseas in January, first part of January, I didn't fly my first mission until, I think, March. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">The biggest thing I remember is I was breathing hard because I had never seen theselittle black puffs coming up into the <span class="DLF">sky</span> , the flack.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">ANSWER:  And I found that I got pretty low on oxygen, because I must have been breathing very, veryhard. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">It was scary but exiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And it was uneventful. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">It was just sort of a milk run or escorting <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">QUESTION:  What sort of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> were they? </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Do you recall?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">ANSWER:  Yeah, mostly all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> that we escorted were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">B-17s</span> sometimes <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">B-24s</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And we couldn't stay with them very long.</span><span class="sentence" id="502">I mean they flew fairly slow compared to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">So they'd be flying along and we'd be just sort of zigzagging because it was _+ get ahead of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">So we could only stay with them for maybe 15, 20 minutes before anothersquadron would come in to take over and escort them alittle bit further. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">So most all our missions in the beginning were escort missions, high altitude, 28 - 30,000 feet, escortingbombers. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Some of our missions later ran into the <span class="REGION">area</span> were low-altitude missions where we'd go in and dive bomb a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , dive bomb atunnel, shoot up atrain, whatever our mission was. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">But most of them -- probably I'd say 60, 70 percent were escort missions and some were just "let's go in and target of opportunity." </span><span class="sentence" id="508">You see something moving, try to stop it from moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Yeah.</span></p>
