QUESTION:  How did you know it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  We learned it, because uh...I was never called a Jew boy or something, no...but I learned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">There there is anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I learned it for...through the press and and uh reading the newspapers and magazines what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Of course, until 1938 uh nothing was uh going on that was that bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">The only thing that was uh we knew that the Jews were not liked and they were considered inferior, but until the Germans uh marched in into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , nothing uh...we...I was protected so much, let's say, by my parents, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">and from uh that I...from anti-Semitism or from knowing too much about it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  How could you, or how do you remember the changes that occurred in your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  The changes that occurred in my life came abruptly. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Uh in uh...Hitler was making big speeches about annexing <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> that was under the Chancellor and uh he uh said <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> has to be liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We all are one big nation he said, and he challenged the Austrian Chancellor to uh debate. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Not a face-to*face debate but a debate on the radio, and it was agreed to and uh Hitler made a two and a half long...two and a half hour long speech by screaming and yelling and shaking his fist and uh citing what <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> did, how they were prosperous and how they...uh one was eliminated unemployment and that was it and uh two days later the Austrian Chancellor, Austrian Chancellor made a speech and he said, at the beginning I don't want to bother you and bore you with uh figures, which was a clear swipe at uh Hitler for citing all those uh unemployment figures etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">and buildup of the industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And then at the end he said OK, let's see who wins. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Next Sun...next Sunday we'll make a , and uh to find out what the Austrians really want. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">If they want to be independent or if they want to be annexed to uh into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and Hitler obviously was afraid what uh the result of the and two days later or twenty-four hours later, German troops rode in and uh goose-stepped into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and from uh my parents’, or our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> I should say to uh...we could uh...we lived on one of the main thorofares and we could see Hitler's troops marching in and his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> rolling in and Hitler standing in the back of his uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored car</span> , with the Nazi salute and greeting and the Austrians were enthusiastic about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Within uh less than twenty-four hours all the Viennese policemen had uh swastika armbands. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Where they came from nobody knows.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  What effect did all of this have on your life as...

QUESTION:  As you think back...think back to Kristallnacht, can you tell us a little about your memory of that experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  Yes, uh we were all shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We knew what happened and through the press and the radio...there was no television of course...we heard uh that the Jews were out to uh take over the world and uh etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">and then a decree came out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> that uh all the Jews had to turn in their gold, silver and uh all their precious stones, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">as uh punishment to for what uh happened to the German uh <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and uh that uh liquidator, Mr. Marscheck...we called him Helm (ph) Marscheck...he called me...he asked me to call him only by his first name, Victor...and he came over to my parents and he said uh to my dad, you're going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to buy more materials and I tell you what. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I'm going with you, not because I'm afraid that you won't come back, but I'm taking all your gold watch, your gold watch, all your wife's...that meaning my mother's jewelry, her diamond ring, her...she had a re...a string of real pearls...with uh and he took it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and he left it with my uncle and it was safe at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Also of course my...what I mentioned before, my bar mitzvah uh watch, and when uh...then in 1939 by mistake came a letter to me, to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , addressed to Hans Heimann. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">It said you are now eighteen years old and you have to report for military...you'll be inducted in the army, which was a mistake of course because they didn't know I was Jewish, and the German army wouldn't accept Jews, so the next day my uh parents called uh my father's distant cousin, second or third cousins, in uh <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and I flew out the next day and stayed with them till uh August of uh 1939, for two months, till I joined my parents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Venice</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  Let's uh go back over this period. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">How did your parents determine to leave?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  The destination uh of uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Venice</span> ...because the Italian government was the only government in the world, not only in Europe, that didn't require a visa for people who wanted to immigrate and we had uh...we had the full intention to go to uh either <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> where my mother had uh customers, or to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> and we got stuck uh with uh the outbreak of World War III, which uh started when Chamberlain and , declared this is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">We don't...can't take it anymore, and declared war on uh <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Great Britain and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Mussolini remained neutral. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Mussolini remained neutral until the...until the fall of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Uh the German army rolled over the...first over the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> , over <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , marched into...around the <span class="DLF">Marginot Line</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and when <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was just about to collapse, Mussolini flexed his muscles and he said well I'm uh the second Caesar. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We declare war on <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ...on uh <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And uh that they did.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="269">QUESTION:  What was the strategy in that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">ANSWER:  That uh it...the Ital...the strategy behind it was uh probably that uh the Italians were not worth uh wasting uh food for in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camps</span> , or wasting ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">The Italians were...had a hard time in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> with uh fighting the partisans, which uh was occupied most...occupied most of their forces, so they couldn't dedicate as much to the uh fighting the British and the Americans as uh they probably wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">They could never win the war against the partisans.</span></p>
