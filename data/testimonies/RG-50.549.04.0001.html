ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Were you named after anybody in particular?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Yes, I was named after my paternal grandfather, who died about two years before I was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Was he -- did he die during the -- during the Holocaust, or was it in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="3">December 13, 2001
ANSWER:  No, no, this -- my -- my father is born in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and his father was also born here, a newly, newly new -- I believe his parents are newly arrived on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lower East Side</span> , perhaps at the e-end of the last century.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Okay, let’s talk about your parents a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">When you think back -- we’re doing this chronologically, I think, which 1s easier in some ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">We can always jump back and forth later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  True.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  When you think back as a small boy, how do you remember your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Difference in -- difference in personalities, wh-what kind of -- when you think back, describe them to us, when we haven’t seen them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  Mm-hm, well actually they’re both alive, so when I say -- you ask, how do I remember my parents, 1-it’s -- 1t’s an unusual question. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I -- I remember them, seeing them, talking to them virtually every day now. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">If you’re asking about the differences between them, and -- and to compare and contrast them, they’re -- they’re quite different people. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I think the most salient difference that one would notice even at first blush is that my mother is clearly European born, you can tell that just by her accent, and my father is an American Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">A-A -- their personality types are also quite different. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My father is a r-reasonably calm and excessively well organized person. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My mother, although she is -- is quite well organized, is a very December 13, 2001 intellectually driven person with a -- a constant thirst for a-acquiring new knowledge and reconsidering and re-evaluating things in her life, both the significant and the trivial on a day to day basis, but her mind is constantly focused on that sort on of endeavor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  I guess my -- my question was sort of trying to first of all get you back into childhood, but also trying to bring out whether or not your perception of your parents has changed over the years [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Oh, I can answer, I do -- I do not think that my perception of them has changed over the years. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I think that w -- the one thing one can say about each of my parents, even my father, who is American, and brings with that certain cultural baggage, 1s that they don’t -- th-they don’t move with -- with the changes and ebbs and flows of American society. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">They’ve been very consistent in their own personality types throughout my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And the things that they were concerned with or dedicated to at the time of my birth, a-and mine and my brother’s upbringing continue to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">They -- they behave and -- and dress actually, very much in the ways that I recall them having done so when I was a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  Interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Talk about your brother a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Who is -- what’s his name, when
ANSWER:  My br -- December 13, 2001
QUESTION:  -- when he was born, and -- and what -- what type is he?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">My brother’s name is Paul Gelb. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Right now he lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albuquerque</span> , but obviously he lived here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> with our family when he grew up. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">He was born April 13" of 1960, also here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> , which makes him four years younger than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And I remember very well the time when he was born, and having been sent for a -- a sleepover to a friend’s, while my mother gave birth to Paul. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I remember him coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and having a -- a reasonably good memory myself, I recall details of our upbringing very, very well since the day he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , because that was his fourth birthday and my memory goes back even farther than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And is there anything in particular you’d like to know about him? </span><span class="sentence" id="32">The way he looks, what his interests are?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  Describe him -- just describe him a little bit to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Sort of as -- over -- against how you think you are, how you see yourself, maybe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Physically my brother, 1-it’s obvious to anyone who would see us, is -- 1s -- he’s a very -- looks very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I am about six feet tall, weigh about 155 pounds, I’m a very thin -- thin framed person. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And my brother is about six feet five inches tall, is physically built -- the only way I can describe him, as I’ve often said, is that he looks like, literally like the statue of a Greek god. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">He works with his body, meaning he’s a landscaper and he designs things and works with things <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span> , heavy December 13, 2001 things, all day. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And I’m sure in large part because of this, he’s able to keep up the tremendous physique that he has. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">But he’s always been a very physical person. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I’ve been a very much more intellectually oriented, and my brother has always been oriented towards sports, the great outdoors, and using his body and keeping it moving and doing things at all times. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Very different type of person from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">We had very similar education though, we went to the same <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> , the same <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> and the same <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And we went to similar <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We went from <span class="BUILDING">PS 187</span> to <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> 143, both in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">upper Manhattan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Then each of us went to the Bronx High School of Science. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And then I went on to <span class="BUILDING">Hamilton College</span> , and four years later, Paul went on to <span class="BUILDING">Saint Lawrence University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Both of those are smaller, upstate New York institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  Did you get along when you were small? </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Were you kind of friends, did you sh -- did you share things, or was it difficult because you were so -- such different people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  I think actually we got along very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">There’s always sibling rivalry, and any pair of brothers who are four years apart who say that they don’t have periodic, or sometimes unrelenting battles between the two of them would be prevaricating. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I'll- I’]l just say that we -- we got along just fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">He, because of his great physical abilities was often welcomed in with my circle of friends, almost as a co-equal, so December 13, 2001 that he could so-called hang with them, and play sports with them, and they looked at him very much as one of their own friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I’m sure that he -- that being welcomed by -- by my friends made his life a little more easy, or fun.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  It’s a -- it’s a good chance, actually, to go back into your childhood, because you said your memory goes back so far. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I’m -- my own does, too, which is interesting, it does in -- sort of in glimpses. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Put -- give us those glimpses that you remem -- give us a few, sort of impressions from what you remember, what it was like in your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , what -- what do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  Hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Well, I rem -- first of all, looking at our general family constellation, some of the most interesting and fun things that -- that we did, meaning Paul and I did as children, was to go and visit our relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">My mother’s family, each -- she has two older sisters, one sister lived with her family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , the other sister lived with her family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And travels out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , to different <span class="NPIP">venues</span> are always interesting to any child. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">What was very unique- visiting <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> , of course, is a foreign country, but I don’t think there is anything in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> that particularly grabbed our attention when compared to our lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , except that it was always fun to see our cousins and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> was very interesting because at that time, our aunt and her husband, our uncle lived on and owned a <span class="DLF">chicken egg farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And they had dogs and December 13, 2001 rabbits and people who worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And imagine coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington Heights</span> and then all of a sudden being allowed to play in -- in a wide open <span class="DLF">farm</span> with your cousins who took you around and showed you all of these things that you’d never been exposed to before. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">You had the run of the <span class="REGION">land</span> , you had the run of the animals, you had the run of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">It was really a big adventure. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We also had a paternal grandmother, who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Asbury Park</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , very, very close to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So when we visited there it was always pleasant for my mother to take us over to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">It was only about four or five blocks directly to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> , and we could go on the little rides, and -- and get a salt water taffy, and orange-ade, and waffles with ice cream and hang out on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> , and if the weather is right we could even go in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">But we could go to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> any time of the year, as long as it was clement weather. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">That was always a fun thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">My brother and I had free run of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> i-in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington Heights</span> , that’s near <span class="DLF">190" Street</span> and <span class="DLF">Fort Washington Avenue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">In those days -- and these days as well, but in those days it was a very, very safe, and the children could wander the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> freely, enjoying everything from the <span class="BUILDING">Cloisters Museum</span> in <span class="DLF">Fort Tryon Park</span> , all the way through playing ball in the <span class="BUILDING">schoolyard</span> as most children would do. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So we had quite a range of things to keep us busy in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77"><span class="DLF">Fort Tryon Park</span> in December 13, 2001 particular providing a spot where a lot of different sorts of recreations and adventures could be had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  Do you recall -- before I -- we talk a little bit more about what it was like at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , in your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> atmosphere and so on, do you remember the particular circumstance or event or so when you first realized, understood, that your mother was what we now call a Holocaust s -- a Holocaust survivor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  There was never a time that I can recall that I was not aware that she and her sisters were Holocaust survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">As a matter of fact my mother has always made it a point, and I know this not only because she did it, but because she said to me, and has reminded me that she has done so, to be very honest a-a-about her background, and I’m quite certain knowing her, that she told us things in an age appropriate manner, meaning age appropriate as far as we children were concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">But we have known as -- as long as I can remember, what our roots were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  Do you remember partic -- a particular sort of w -- how she talked to you about it, or do you -- its -- an-and your response, your feelings? </span><span class="sentence" id="83">How do you -- how did you f -- how did you feel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Well --
QUESTION:  What -- what was your response to it? </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Sort of, curiosity, fear, anger, resentment, what sort of happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="86">December 13, 2001
ANSWER:  Speaking for myself, I -- I -- then, and now, my reaction is always curiosity and further curiosity. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I in no way ever resented this. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">As a matter of fact, since so many o-of my mother’s relatives, and -- and of course her extended circle of friends were survivors as well, this was not something that seemed in any way aberrational or different. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">This was just something that I accepted as the norm, that some of the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> I lived in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington Heights</span> , had come over after World War II as survivors, as compared to the many, many other, particularly German Jews who settled along <span class="DLF">Fort Washington Avenue</span> in the late 1920’s and 1930’s, before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Many of the children in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> were the descendants of that group of people, as well, but basically those are the types of people that lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where Paul and I grew up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Did you perceive any differences that might be attributed to Holocaust experiences among your aunt as over -- against your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  Well, I think 1-1t’s -- they’re -- both aunts, and you have to remember that my mother, a-as you might know is the youngest of three sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">My -- when the war broke out, as my mother was born in December of 1929, and the war broke out in September of 1939, my mother had not even celebrated her 10" birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So her outlook on the war, both then and now, 1-1n retrospect, is I’m certain quite, quite different from that, let’s say, of her oldest sister, who 1s significantly older than she. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">December 13, 2001 My -- my mother’s oldest sister, 1f I’m correct, ha -- was already attending <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , and my mother would have just been a <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> child at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So the -- the -- how do we say, perspective that -- that a -- a child who’s 10 years old would have on the outbreak of war is certainly different than a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> child would have. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">My -- I-I -- I’m sorry, I just -- I was wondering what it -- exactly it was that you’d like me to get at, because it’s such a -- a broad <span class="REGION">area</span> , and --
QUESTION:  Well, I was just -- we can -- can leave that alone and bring it up later --
ANSWER:  Just go right ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  -- and talk more about it, but I was kind of thinking, because of the a -- wh- whether you saw, as a -- this, still trying to be in your childhood somewhere, it’s kind of hard to [indecipherable] --
ANSWER:  No, no, I understand --
QUESTION:  -- separately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  -- but you were asking about my mother and her sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  Yeah, whether you perceived certain differences. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">The way they were, or the way they talked, or what they talked about, what they didn’t talk about --
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  -- that could be attributed to experiences in the -- during the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">December 13, 2001
ANSWER:  I think that the amount of -- of discussion that any o -- that either or -- of her sisters, and compared to my mother, that any of the three girls had about Holocaust activity, or what ha-had happened to them, I mean, in the Holocaust, 1s more reflection of their -- just of their basic personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">For example, my oldest -- my mother’s oldest sister, my oldest aunt, I was just going to say, is just slightly more reticent, but that’s just her -- her -- just innate character. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">She’s always willing to discuss, and always was willing to discuss their past. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">She married a survivor, and someone that she had known overseas, of course, and she -- he was a -- he was a guerilla fighter, as was the husband that my mother’s next oldest sister married. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">They were all survivors, so within the family, issues of discussing their past are certainly -- were n-nothing to hide, this was part of their joint and several backgrounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And actually, my father would be the only one who would be viewed or -- I shouldn’t he would be -- he could have been, but he wasn’t viewed as an outsider, having been born here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and grown up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">It’s a -- but my father fit right in with the family, he -- he’s just a -- a very gentle and welcoming sort of person and -- and that is reflected in the way that these five other people treated him and accepted him. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">The sister -- my mother’s middle sister, so to speak, the sister that lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , and her husband have always been, out of the three sisters, the most involved in Holocaust related activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">As December 13, 2001 you might know, the sister who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> married a gentleman names Miles Lerman, who eventually became the chairman of the Holocaust Memorial Commission and <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C</span> .. So all of our family has always looked up to Uncle Miles and his activities as exemplars of -- of what one could in reference to remembering or commemorating the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">But that doesn’t in any way mean that I wish to give short shrift to the concerns and activities, both of his wife and of my mother and her oldest sister, who live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Her name is Hania?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Hania. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Her name is Hania Wilson, her -- people call her Anna. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And the sister who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> is Krysia, but people call her Chris, their last name is Lerman. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And I forgot to say that the uncle that I had, by marriage of course, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> , who is now deceased, his name was Adash Wilson, but he was known in Can-Canada as Adrian. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And the uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> , who is the hol -- <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span> is Miles Lerman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  Di -- I -- I gather yet that you did get along with your cousins, but --
ANSWER:  Oh sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  -- speak a little more about that relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Is it particularly close or just sort of, and did you talk about, amongst yourself about the experience of your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="122">December 13, 2001
ANSWER:  There is -- looking back, there was some discussion about it, but more in latter days, more since the time I would be college age, and in a way that isn’t really reflective of how we were raised. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Seeing our cousins was basically seeing our cousins and having fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Of course, visiting <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , those cousins from the oldest sister were a bit older than me and Paul, and I’m sure they looked at us as -- as their nice, very much younger cousins visiting from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But we were entertained when we visited there, largely by my mother who -- who took us around and made sure that Paul and I had fun things to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">However, when we went down to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> , my cousin David, who is the younger of Krysia and Miles’s two children, and was a boy as well, and was also involved in boy’s scouting, was a hero to me and Paul. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">He led us through adventures on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and -- and starting little campfires and cooking potatoes and hot dogs and chasing the chickens through the coop, and taking fresh eggs [indecipherable] under the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">nest</span> and just generally having a lot of fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">All of the other three cousins, meaning his older sister and the two cousins in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> are female. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So I -- I suppose one could say that Paul and I had a bit of a closer relationship to David at the time we were children. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Also, when we were growing up there came a point where David’s older sister, since we saw th-this family more often, they were living in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , David’s older sister was away at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brandeis</span> for four years, and then went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanford</span> for <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> , so December 13, 2001 we didn’t see her for long periods of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">But David was around a lot when I was in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and David was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">My first ever college field trip was to visit David up at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">That would be in the spring of 1972. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And that was a big adventure for me too, it was a big trip away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  Okay, let’s go back to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">That was a good -- and if you want to take a sip of water, you can do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Yeah, let’s go back to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and see sort of what kind of values were stressed? </span><span class="sentence" id="138">What -- with regarding t -- with regard to education and religious upbringing and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">What was important to your parents and what -- what -- what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  With regards to education, I can speak both for my mother and for each of her two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">They were extremely devoted to the -- the value of education and a classical education at that. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Each of the three sisters a-and their spouses as well, drove all of us cousins, so to speak, to a-achieve academically as much as we possibly could. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And virtually all of us have graduate degrees and we all did excessively well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We went to excellent <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and did well in them. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I’m proud to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Education, though, isn’t only what one does in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">My -- my mother, as -- as well as her two sisters exposed the -- their very -- their respective children to all sorts of -- of -- both performing and fine arts, to make sure that we had a -- a breadth of knowledge and familiarity with the -- the humanities, that December 13, 2001 would not make us simply narrow academics, but to make us a broader and more fulfilled and self-fulfilling people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  Yeah, your mother actually said in her interview that the emphasis as far as she was concerned was not so much on succeeding, but on broadening their horizons. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So you would say that’s how you would see that -- how -- how you see that too, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  Absolutely, it’s both. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">It isn’t yust -- ne -- she -- I -- | agree with her, even in her own self estimation. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I think that she both was very interested that -- that we succeeded o-on both a substantive level and of course competitively, which don’t necessarily go hand in hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And also that -- that we became more familiar with other cultures and other histories that weren’t our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And I know her two sisters felt exactly the same, because you can see it 1n -- in the way their children are now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  Was that a burden to you sometimes too, that you felt that you had to kind of move on and make her proud, or was it something that just sort of came naturally to you anyway?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  I don’t think that it was a burden that I felt that I had to make her, in particular, proud. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I think that any student of any parent, who 1-1s at all competitive in the ac- academic environment, wishes to succeed and knows that his or her parents will be proud, but I don’t think that that was the moving force that would make me work December 13, 2001 harder in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I just wanted to do well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> so that I could learn the material I had, because that was basically my job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Was it equally important to your father, or was there a slight difference in -- in emphasis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  I’m -- I’m sure it was equally important to my father, but in every <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , each parent fulfills different roles. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Some overlap and some are very distinct a-and separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">In our <span class="BUILDING">household</span> this is just -- education of the children and the supervision of it and the guiding of 1t was something more within my mother’s province, than within my father’s, although he certainly would help me with anything from mathematics to French. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">But when look -- when looked at from the big perspective, it was always my mother who was the one who was involved in all of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> activities for the parents and in support of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">In scouting activities my father helped, but my mother helped when we were in the cub scouts, which was what the -- what parents did in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">But 1t was my mother really, who was more involved with us in making sure that we academically achieved what we could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  What about cultural and religious upbringing, sort of Jewishness?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  Mm-hm, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">December 13, 2001
QUESTION:  What -- what -- how important was that, and -- and what -- kind of what coloration did it take on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  I think that my brother and I were raised as American children in that the primary focus of our upbringing was not on the fact that we were Jewish, but that we were growing children that needed education. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">This is not in any way to minimize the role that religion played in -- in Paul and my upbringing. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">From our -- from my earliest recollection my parents have been members of the Hebrew tabernacle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington Heights</span> , which is a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> that used to be on 161“ and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Washington</span> , but around 1972 or ’73 moved closer to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , to <span class="DLF">185" Street</span> and <span class="DLF">Fort Washington Avenue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">The <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew tabernacle</span> is a -- a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> or a congregation largely made up of the German Jewish émigrés that I had referred to before, but there are quite a few people like -- like our family, who came from other backgrounds, but who were Jewish as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">My cousins all ri -- belong to <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and in each of their families they were very, very ab -- involved in their religious upbringings. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Even more particular is the zi -- Zionistic upbringing and religious upbringing that went hand in hand with that, that my cousins in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> enjoyed as children. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">While I was very, very involved, for example, as an adolescent in -- in boy scout activities at wa -- a-at the same time, in tandem with my <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> activities, but still I -- I was very heavily involved in boy scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Both David and December 13, 2001 Jeanette were deeply, deeply, deeply involved in Young Judaea. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And each of them became national officers, they worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">As a matter of fact, my cousin David met his wife at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Young Judaea</span> in <span class="REGION">Texas</span> when he was a counselor there many, many years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Many years, obviously, before they got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">But as aj -- as a general matter, all of our parents had us involved in a religious upbringing, but the Lerman family was very involved in Zionistic ac-activities as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  What kind of friends -- who were your friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Jewish in background, or a mix, or sort of who were your friends and did you talk -- did they know that you were a child of a survivor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  Everyone in the class knew what -- where everyone’s parents came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">For example, one of my classmates in <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> , Steven Guttman, was not a child of survivors, he -- but he was from a German Jewish family that had come over just before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">He was very proud though, to say that his maternal grandfather had- who was obviously Jewish, had served in the Kaiser’s army in World War I, and was a wounded and decorated combat veteran, having taken some sort of shrap -- shrapnel in the belly, and had been very proud of the service that he had offered his- his government, meaning his <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , during World War I. They subsequently emigrated to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in the 1930’s, and what happened December 13, 2001 thereafter is indeed history. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">But Steven was never embarrassed and was actually proud to point out his grandfather’s history. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">On the other hand, there were other children in our class who were not Jewish, there were other children who were not even from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , who were bused in during the desegregation years. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">One of tho -- one of my classmates then, with whom I’m not in touch now, but o-of whom I’m very proud, is now the chair French horn -- lead chair French horn at the <span class="BUILDING">New York Philharmonic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And he’s a student who was bused into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> for desegregation purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Another one of the children that was bused in eventually became a leader of the New York Black Panther party. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">So there were quite -- was quite a variety of children, but most of the children in our class were Jewish and lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , but a few were Italian, a few were Irish, a few were Greek. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">It was a regular mix of Washington Heights children that attended <span class="BUILDING">PS 187</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">My brother, being only four years younger than us had basically the same sort of balance in his classes as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  What your -- what was sort of your impression of s -- during the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> years, <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , sort of the Holocaust education? </span><span class="sentence" id="195">It didn’t exist in the way it exists now, but what did you learn about the Holocaust and did you know much more, and why, if you did. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">December 13, 2001
ANSWER:  By the way, I -- I did want to state -- you asked me if I knew other children who were survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Yes, I did, and the few of us all -- we didn’t walk around talking about this, but we all knew each other’s parents and knew where they had been and our parents all knew each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">But I don’t think it bore in any way on the way we interacted as children. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">We just were classmates in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and we did everything that all the other children did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">QUESTION:  Well, it’s only interesting if you talked about differently about -- if you t -- if that issue came up in a different way than it came up with others, that would be interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">ANSWER:  These -- these sorts of things came up, but only when -- I-I’d say when I was over -- over the age of 17 or 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">In other words, after -- I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> early, so after I got out of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and people became freer in talking -- or more interested maybe in talking about these things, and I -- I ki -- will tell you later a bit about some of the other people that -- that I knew and the things that we discussed in -- 1n those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">But as a child, this is not something the -- that the children used as a -- as a conversation item between them. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Now, you were asking about -- about how I view education. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">When I went to the Bronx High School of Science, you can imagine that like me there were many other children of survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And of course in those days, Bronx Science was heavily December 13, 2001 Jewish as a general matter, whether that be American Jews or Jews from other parts of the world, and not necessarily Holocaust survivors, per se. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Then, at that point there was no formal Holocaust education class or program at <span class="BUILDING">Bronx Science</span> , although I distinctly recall that these issues were discussed in social studies classes as -- as one would expect them to be, in the context of studying history. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">However, shortly after I left, the Bronx High School of Science opened what I believe was the first <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> Holocaust study center of its kind in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and it’s there to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I actually happened to stop by <span class="BUILDING">Bronx Science</span> last week cause I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> on business, to see one of my old history, or social studies teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And indeed, the <span class="BUILDING">center</span> is -- we actually mentioned it, the <span class="BUILDING">center</span> is still there, and the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , though, has changed, and what -- what is wonderful about having the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust center</span> there now is that the student body 1s made up of children who might not know as much as we did when we were children, the reason being that Bronx Science, like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuyvesant</span> and <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn Tech</span> is now heavily Asian. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And overall one could say that whereas the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was largely Jewish when I went there -- of course, there were -- there were hundreds and hundreds of other children from other backgrounds, whether they be -- were Protestants or Catholic, Irish or Greek or -- or -- or black Americans or Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Now, the vast proportion, maybe not the majority, but a vast proportion of the students hail from Asia. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And December 13, 2001 you can see that the minute you enter these <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">It -- this is just reflective, in many ways, of the changing ethnic face of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And it’s a wonderful thing to know that this <span class="BUILDING">center</span> is serving these children’s educational needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  Okay, I think we should stop here and flip the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">This is the end of tape one, side A, interview with Harry Gelb. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Harry Gelb. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">This is tape number one, side B. And I think it makes sense at this point to continue with your education. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">So, <span class="BUILDING">Bronx High school</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">Science school</span> , and then where do we -- where did you afterwards?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  When I graduated Bronx High School of Science, I went to <span class="BUILDING">Hamilton College</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">upstate New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Earlier you asked me about my mother’s ideas about education. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">One of the most interesting aspects of -- of -- of my outlook, and the counsel that I give to my children and others nowadays, 1s -- is my mother’s attitude about going on to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I think it was a given with every family in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> that their children would go on to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and probably <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">It wasn’t just that. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Many parents, including my wife’s parents, believed that a child should maybe live at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or stay in their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home city</span> , etcetera, when they December 13, 2001 went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">It’s just sort of a continuation of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">My mother was insistent all along -- she wasn’t insistent meaning she w -- she would not ha-have -- put me to the guillotine had I decided to attend <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">NYU</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fordham</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">You can rest assured, I’m sure she would have been quite proud and supportive. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">However, from the earliest years my -- my mother encouraged me and Paul to think about going away to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And why was this? </span><span class="sentence" id="233">She was v-very o- open about why this was. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">When my mother came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , she came under the supervision and the guardianship of her next oldest sister, which is Krysia, and Krysia’s new husband Miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And when they first came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> they lived together as a family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , and then Krysia gave birth to my cousin Jeanette, and my mother was involved in raising her. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And then there came a point in time, the exact date I don’t recall, but that’s not really relevant, when Miles and Krysia decided to move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , and my mother was to stay on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and attend <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn College</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">She had attended Thomas Jefferson High School first, wh-when she first got here, graduated and went onto <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn College</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">While my mother was there, she received a very, very unique offer to teach Polish in a counterintelligence training program at <span class="BUILDING">Indiana University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bloomington</span> , <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Now needless to say, my mother, I am sure, did not know much, perhaps just a little, little bit, but not know much at all about what <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> December 13, 2001 was or even perhaps where it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">But the offer included the opportunity to both teach and to finish her undergraduate education, at I -- I -- I’m certain a -- a financially acceptable situation for her, given the fact that she was basically on her own. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">So off she went to <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And she always told us as children how fondly she looked back on her experiences in <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">The point of what I’m saying is specifically that she always told us how important it was 1n her upbringing, to be exposed to a different cultural and intellectual milieu, while she was in <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> , from the one she would have been exposed to had she stayed here and attended <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn College</span> and finish her education there. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And -- although of course, immediately after graduating from <span class="BUILDING">Indiana University</span> , she did indeed move back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , she always told us and still does to this day, how highly she valued the years that she spent there. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Both the fact that she ha -- got a wonderful education, but also because she met so many different types of people from so many different backgrounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">The kinds of folks that came from all over <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , particularly in <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> , <span class="REGION">middle America</span> , that she would never have seen here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> during those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And I suppose that that in large part informed the way she counseled me and Paul about the -- maybe not advisability but about the weight we should give in -- in thinking of out of town schools. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And you’ll notice that both Paul and I went off to out of town schools. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And the end of my four years at December 13, 2001 Hamilton, I did move back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , but I moved back here at that point largely because the <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> that had selected me, which was <span class="BUILDING">New York University</span> was a fine institution. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">If one, for example, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , had accepted me that I wanted to attend, I would have gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , and perhaps eventually relocated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">As a matter of fact, now that I think back on it, I probably would have. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">But it wa -- the selection of venue for <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> was not made with the same considerations that my selection of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  Why <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Why law? </span><span class="sentence" id="255">In what direction did you want to go into?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  I always felt as a child that my interests, or that my -- I shouldn’t say that my interests, that my intellectual proclivities and leanings were more in the humanities than in the sciences or mathematics. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And although to be honest -- an-and I don’t -- I don’t say this to brag, it’s just a statement of fact, I did exceptionally well in both the sciences and re -- and almost as well in mathematics. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Better than most, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I never found that I had much interest in anything other than the biology of medicine, in particular, but I was -- had really very little interest in physics, or chemistry, or pure mathematics or computers, or whatever other sorts of sciences, so to speak, were available to me a-as a -- intellectual or academic endeavors. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">On the other hand, I -- I was always, always, always drawn to history and literature and language. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And to this day, even while in the practice of law, I’m a voracious reader December 13, 2001 and alternate reading books of nonfiction and reading books largely of classical literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Incessantly, I read every day on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subways</span> and before I go to sleep, in order to continue my self-education, even while practicing a very narrow area of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">QUESTION:  Before we continue, you had -- you -- wh-which direction in law did you choose? </span><span class="sentence" id="264">What -- what did you want to become and what did you become?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  I am reasonably unique among the -- my fellow graduates from <span class="BUILDING">NYU law school</span> and the class of 1980, in my having gone into what’s called public interest or public service law. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Technically I’m in public service law, meaning I’m a government employee. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">But even while in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> , I was not drawn at all to the rather lucrative world of corporate or business law. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Coming out of <span class="BUILDING">NYU law school</span> , the <span class="DLF">doors</span> are largely open to those wishing to practice those areas, and many, many, many of my friends went into those <span class="REGION">areas</span> , and are doing financially quite well, I -- i-intellectually, we don’t discuss. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">It’s just the job, it’s the same as running any other business. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I always felt socially impelled t-to find something that I could do that would be of some good or service to others, and -- and I felt a natural affinity for government service. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I eventually dis -- sub -- I -- now I-I mean it’s sub - sub - sub- specialty of the law, but I started when I -- I -- well, actually, when I was -- let me f- let me restart that. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">When I was in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> , I clerked at a <span class="BUILDING">litigation firm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">It was December 13, 2001 a union labor law litigation firm, but I found that I enjoyed litigation, it matches my personality type very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And when I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> , I worked in -- in an admiralty insurance and personal injury litigation firm again, while still looking, all of the -- this time for a public service job that would suit my own personal, social and intellectual needs. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I eventually was made a job offer by then the human resources administration of the city of New York, which was then the parent organization for the agency that I still work for, which 1s the New York City administration for Children’s Services. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And since New Year’s of 1983, ve worked exclusively in child neglect, child abuse and termination of parental rights litigation. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I also have a -- a side specialty of immigration law as it pertains to children who are aliens, who find themselves in New York City foster care. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">That’s sort of a sidelight of my own, but it’s all within the same job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">QUESTION:  I don’t want to ask this as an oversimplified question, but I noticed that some children of survivors who decided to become lawyers, became defense lawyers, because they kind of identified with the victim. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Now you became the prosecutor, but of -- of -- of people who abuse children.</span></p>

ANSWER:  I -- I think that might be reaching a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I think that even were my mother not a survivor, given the values that were imparted to me and Paul as children, an area of law that is somewhat related to social work, as mine is, would be the type of thing that I might have enjoyed doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">On the other hand, I -- I -- I -- well, actually it’s not on the other hand, I really don’t see much of a connection with -- with defense lawyers as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I think that you -- you -- one might find some degree of social concern in children of the Holocaust, but for example, my roommate from <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> , from my first year there, who 1-is the child of a survivor is now a partner in a very large <span class="BUILDING">corporate law firm</span> , and he has been with them exclusively since we graduated from <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> in 19 -- in 1980. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Actually, and sadly, his firm was one of the firms that was blown out of the <span class="BUILDING">World Trade Center</span> , number one <span class="BUILDING">World Trade Center</span> on September 11". </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And fortunately, all but one of his co-workers made it out of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> safely. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And th-th-that’s a wonderful thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">But a -- I -- I actually should tell you, it’s a very interesting story involving this young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">The summer before I attended <span class="BUILDING">NYU law school</span> , I -- I had subscribed to live in their <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">NYU</span> so I wouldn’t have to commute from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington Heights</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">| received a -- a note in the mail that -- you know, one of those, your roommate will be -- you know, John Smith, and his address and phone number are, if you want to contact him, go ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Well, I open the envelope and there’s this letter, and it says, December 13, 2001 your roommate will be Lawrence A. Bauer, 98 Park Terrace East, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , New -- and I said, what? </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I can’t believe this, it’s Larry Bauer. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">It turns out that Larry Bauer -- first of all, I-I -- my earliest memory of him 1-is coincident, both he and I, although he lives about a mile from my parents, his family belonged to the same <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and at the high holy days, their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pew</span> , it was the same -- we shared the sa -- the two families, the Bauers and the Gelbs were assigned <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pew</span> for years and years. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Also, Larry and I, although he’s a year older than me, attended <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">day camp</span> together for years and rode the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">camp bus</span> , although we weren’t close, because we lived about a mile apart and traveled in different circles of friends and went to different <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , we knew each other reasonably well from those two contacts. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">So I was very, very pleased, I called him, he received the same letter on the same day. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And it was -- 1-it was a really, really strange coincidence that we lived together, and while together we got to know -- obviously we’re sharing a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for a year, we got to know each other much, much better. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">His -- to answer a question about him that you had asked me earlier, Larry’s father came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , a German Jew in the 1930’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Larry’s mother, also a German Jew was incarcerated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , a -- a survivor, e-e-eventually in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and -- but she, like m-my mother, survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">What makes them very, very different, meaning the two mothers, is the degree to which they were willing to go in discussing their December 13, 2001 wartime experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And all through <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> -- at the time, Larry, of course knew what his mother’s background was, but his mother would tell him that basically -- she basically had -- had given up on religion, although his father wa-wa- was quite committed, because she -- and this is Larry’s -- I’m paraphrasing Larry’s words, she felt that -- that God must have given up on the Jews in order for such a thing to have happened to her and to her entire family, which was lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">It was in more recent years, since the death of Larry’s father that he started to talk in depth with his mother about these issues. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And he asked her why it was that she didn’t talk much about these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And she s -- and she laughed and turned and said, what do you mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="306">She said, I’m willing to talk about them, you just didn’t ask me enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">In -- in the last few years, I-I’m sure that his discoveries about his mother’s background have grown geometrically, and that this is -- this 1s a -- a most in -- most intelligent and forthcoming woman, and I -- I just found it interesting that for whatever reason, Larry and I grew up in -- in basically parallel lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington Heights</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Inwood</span> , during our formative years, our knowledge base may have been the same, but the amount that Holocaust issues was discussed in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was quite different. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">The result is the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I think we have about the same consciousness, and about the same regard for our parents a-a-as each other, December 13, 2001 but I-I just think that 1-it was a very interesting thing to share th-this reflection on our upbringing with -- with a roommate over the course of an entire year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">QUESTION:  Is there another example that you have that whi -- that you had a chance to see how other children of survivors lived, and how that -- it turned out, sort of to compare to your own? </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Okay, let’s get to your wife, then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER:  Yes, well --
QUESTION:  You’ve pointed at your ring, your wedding ring.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">ANSWER:  Yes, in -- indeed, my wife a -- is a child of a survivor as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Interestingly enough, I did not meet her because of that in any way, shape or form. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Quite simply my brother, while attending Bronx Science, didn’t know th-this person who would eventually become my wife, but overheard he -- this person telling a teacher that she would be attending <span class="BUILDING">Hamilton College</span> that coming fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamilton</span> at the time, and my brother said, wow, maybe Harry should meet her. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">So he called me and said, I saw this girl, and I saw that she was talking to such and such people and I’m going to try to find out who she 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And when I came back at the end of my junior year from <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , my brother had me introduced to Cheryl. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And then, of course, we started dating and met her family and I found as follows. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Cheryl’s father grew up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> just west, just outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aleksandrow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">His parents owned a <span class="BUILDING">sock factory</span> , a very small one, but they December 13, 2001 manufactured socks, and he came from a very, very large Hassidic family. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">The family was very different from my mother’s family, but basically his family was not atypical in any way. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">During the war his family was broken up very, very rapidly, and he, being almost exactly the same age as my mother, it was a very, very young, but obvi -- what turned out to be very resilient little guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Ver -- must have had tremendous inner strengths because unlike my mother, he was separated at the most early stages of the war from all of his siblings and relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">My mother, fortunately, went through all of the war with her two older sisters, and most of the war with their father, before he was lost in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So Cheryl’s -- Cheryl’s father lost all of his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">One of his brothers apparently is -- so we hear, maybe an apocryphal story, may not, starved himself to death for lack of kosher food, when he -- when he reached the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Whether this 1s so or not, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Other -- other ru -- unverifiable rumors are that his parents were gassed in the experimental gas trucks, the carbon monoxide poisoning <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , earlier on, during the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">But with such a large family, it’s hard to say who went where. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Th-The bottom line is that with the exception of his oldest sister, who had moved to then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> before the war, every other member of his family was lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And this was a huge extended family. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Cheryl -- also I should say, Cheryl’s father was one of the earlier inmates of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">You could tell this by his tattoo. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">He had a sloppily drawn, scrawled December 13, 2001 tattoo across much of his forearm, much closer to the wrist. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">The -- it was just a series of numbers with no letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">This denotes a person who entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> earlier on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ’s operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Later in the war, when my mother got there with her sisters, the numbers were done much more neatly, inside the ar -- I -- I think the word is the crook or crick of the elbow. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And because they had basically run out of numbers in the first series, they started adding a letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">So right away you could see that -- that -- that Max, that’s Cheryl’s father, had been at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Very interesting what a tough little guy this man was. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Not only did he survive from having been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> from the earliest days, but he was sent to be a Slave laborer, all though <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> during much of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">He worked on everything from road crews to <span class="BUILDING">aircraft factories</span> , to chemical plants. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">He used to refer to Igay, you know, I -- meaning I.G. Farben all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">He worked in one of their plants, somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I don’t know exactly which one, but he was shunted from one <span class="BUILDING">facility</span> to another as a slave laborer. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Of course, he was lucky enough at the end of all these trials and tribulations to be sent back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for a little vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">He ris -- he was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for the second time at approximately the same time that my mother was arriving there for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And, of course, bo -- it’s obvious he had to survive, because he gave birth to my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">But both he and my mother, separately, survived the death marches after the December 13, 2001 evacuation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in January and then February and then March of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">But this Max, Cheryl’s father, went through many, many, many, many hardships. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">He was a very, very small man physically, meaning in stature. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And he credits other Jews who looked kindly upon him as sort of the little guy, to make him into a mascot and take him under their wing, to protect him, as time went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I think he perhaps gave them too much credit and he should have complimented himself more on his amazing tenacity. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">He died, unfortunately, of lung cancer, in 1981, about a year -- a year after we got married -- meaning Cheryl and I got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">But I was able to share during the four or five years that I knew him, much of his background with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And as Cheryl’s older sister 1s also tremendously interested in their -- their father’s background and history, as was Cheryl. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So between each of the two daughters, they really know quite a bit a-about his history. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">He -- after the war, he moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> just as my mother moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> with her sister Krysia. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">My mother’s sister Hania, by the way, moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Anyway, Max, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> met a very, very nice person of Polish descent, meaning non- Jewish Polish descent, and this is my mother-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">They -- they fell in love, and she converted to Judaism in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , they were still dating for years, and filed their separate papers, one as -- as a refugee, one as an immigrant to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and arrive, I think, within about a year or two of each other, and w- December 13, 2001 whereupon they were married, and they raised -- first they lived in -- in a -- basically a Holocaust survivor’s enclave, in the area of 106" to <span class="DLF">110" Street</span> and Broadway. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">This is where both of their daughters were born, but my wife’s older sister is five years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">I believe they li -- they lived with the children there for about six years and subsequently relocated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riverdale</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">The chil -- both of their children attended -- I suppose the loose term is <span class="BUILDING">parochial school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">What I should say is a progressive Jewish Day school, whereas I went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Yet, each of the two girls ended up at the Bronx High School of Science for their secondary education.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">QUESTION:  Did you exper -- did she have a different kind of upbringing in some ways? </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Di -- was -- was -- wa -- the difference between the <span class="BUILDING">households</span> , anything that was interesting in that context? </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Similar --
ANSWER:  I suppose one could say that Cheryl’s father was more observant than my mother, but I don’t know if that 1s reflected so much as a matter of factual practice, as a reflection of the way they were brought up in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> as children. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Cheryl’s father was brought up in a Hassidic family, and although he, when here, practiced - I suppose in -- in his mind a more ortho -- Orthodox view of -- of Judaism, I can’t really see in practice, even now as an adult looking back, how much or -- or in what ways that differed from the way that our parents -- and specifically you’re asking December 13, 2001 about my mother’s experiences, ho-how ma -- our parents raised Paul and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I suppose we went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> with about the same frequency. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">My wife had a Bat Mitzvah, I had a Bar Mitzvah, etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Maybe the prayers, the types of songs that we used were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Maybe the practices or the outlook of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> that we attended were different, but by and large I think that our consciousness of being Jews, and of practicing Judaism, and of having basically a -- a strong Jewish and Holocaust survivor’s identity 1s probably just about the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">QUESTION:  I just want to get back to something. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I -- I just got the impression that you really did a lot of homework on reading up about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Speak a little bit more about that, because some children didn’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">So you consciously -- I don’t want to lead you, but --
ANSWER:  No, no, I absolutely -- I consciously did look out to educate myself about Holocaust history. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">First, I suppose I ex -- my -- am -- and in this my father was always willing to help me, expose myself to the history of world -- of World War II, and the World War II era in general. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">My father is a Korean war era veteran, having been too young to have served during World War II, cause he was born in December of 1928. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">However, he was drafted u-upon his college graduation and served in the U.S. Army during the Korean war. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">But he was always willing to share the American view o-of the war with me, both the -- in the European and Pacific December 13, 2001 <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">My mother, as I said, was always willing to share with me as a child a bit about her background, and not in a way that would horrify or scare her children, but in a way that was f-factually appropriate for what -- even now when I look back on it | would say that it was factually appropriate for a child to learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">For example, you don’t say that people are gasping, they’re choking, and they -- that sort of thing, you'd say that -- that they died. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">That’s what you would tell as -- a small child. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Well, that’s the way she would have talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">However, around the years that I got into <span class="BUILDING">yunior high school</span> , I developed an -- sort of an independent and some might view strange craving for information on the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And -- and this 1s true, I -- I would, with frequency, stop by the <span class="BUILDING">public library branch</span> near my <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> , all the way down on <span class="DLF">178th Street</span> and <span class="DLF">Saint Nicholas Avenue</span> , quite a bit out of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , to look at Holocaust and World War II history books. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">For example, I remember right now that the call numbers for all those books are in the 940’s for nonfiction. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I know it’s a strange thing to remember, what can I tell you, I remember these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I -- I remember distinctly, looking through the transcripts of the Nuremberg Trials, which this -- this would have been in 1968 - 1969, it would have been reasonably new volumes to that <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , this sort of a [indecipherable] and ho-how fascinated I was with -- with the justice that was being done, and I’m sure I also had some lurid fascination with the -- the factual details o-of the horrors of extermination. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I -- I can’t see how any human being wouldn’t interested in some way 1n those aspects as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">But as a child of a 38December 13, 2001 survivor perhaps I was a little bit more interested in what happened to all of -- of my mother’s family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">QUESTION:  Since we are in the 60’s, let me ask you a follow up question that I meant to ask you earlier, but I didn’t want to interrupt. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Your mother did not like the 60’s very much because they seemed to pose a threat to the order that she needed very much, and she was worried a little bit, that you go s -- astray somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Speak a little bit about that from your perspective.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">ANSWER:  I think that it’s very unusual that you bring that up and the statement you made is quite correct, even from -- from my viewpoint and I am her son. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I think my mother, and actually all of the Holocaust survivor parents that I know are tremendously patriotic for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , a-and truly love the opportunities and freedoms that this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> afforded them after they came here and became citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I can’t overemphasize that enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And I think that that patriotism in many ways, I wouldn’t say blinds, but at least colors or informs the judgments that my -- or expectations that my mother had for the way society would evolve in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I think that my -- 1-in particular my cousins from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> were -- I wouldn’t think that they were exposed, it -- it’s not that they were exposed to a -- a more liberal or progressive political point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">It may be just that they evolved that way, for whatever reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">But my brother and I are more main <span class="DLF">line</span> , as -- politically, as far as children who grew up in our general circumstances or milieu, whereas my cousins David and Jeanette might perhaps be s-said to be more liberal or more progressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I think that in many ways growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> during a period when there were -- were 39December 13, 2001 desegregation issues, race riots, etcetera, may have influenced the way Paul and I looked at the development of society. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">This is not to say that -- that we a-agree with our mother’s outlook. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I will say that I distinctly recall my mother’s reactions to the -- the cultural changes of the late 60’s, and I often look back on the year of 1968 as a sort of -- I wouldn’t say a high water mark, cause in my mother’s estimation it was certainly not a -- a high water mark, but a salient date in the cultural changes of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and perhaps of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">It was in that year, for example, that Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were assassinated. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">There were riots, there was a school strike here. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">There wa -- the Vietnam protests were at their height. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">The er -- the era of hippy-ness in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was reaching its height in tandem with the anti- Vietnam war movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">This was a period of tremendous change in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and the same sorts of things happened, you had the cultural revolution in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> , you had the student riots in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , I mean, I remember these very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">We -- you also had the war that had occurred in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> the year before. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">There -- there were lots of -- of changes, there was a lot of violence and turmoil in the war, and I -- i-in the world, excuse me, and I’m sure that these things, given my mother’s background, these -- these changes, it must -- must have in some way influenced her -- how -- how may we Say it?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">A moment ago you had asked me about my mother’s outlook on the social changes during the 1960’s and how that in -- might or might not have impacted upon Paul and my u-upbringing. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And I was just saying that I -- that I look back on the year of 1968 in -- in many ways as -- as -- as a Sort of a s -- very significant date i-in -- in cultural and societal history in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and I know that my mother would say the same, at least in that regard. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">My mother was -- and continues to be very dedicated to social justice, and I think that the -- that -- that she viewed the changes of the late 1960’s not only as being disrespectful to -- to societal or cultural norms, but as being disruptive to a -- to a o-ongoing development of justice for all people. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And 1-in many ways I think she’s right, I mean, I don’t agree entirely with her, but I-I think that she -- she might have failed to take into account that <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> then, and now even more So 1s -- 1s -- 1S an 1n-increasingly diverse nation with -- with a cultural and -- and intellectual forces driving and pulling it in many directions, none of which can be controlled. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And c-come -- coming from the background that she did, I can see why she might have expectations o-of society that are different from my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">But I -- I do agree with her 1-insofar as saying that things were radically and rapidly changing at that period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">December 13, 2001

<p><span class="sentence" id="426">ANSWER:  I think -- I think that in many ways I -- Iam more a-accepting of -- how can I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="427">It isn’t people’s viewpoints, my mother’s very willing to hear people’s viewpoints, but -- but o-of aberrational or -- or eccentric behaviors, and -- and I’m more tolerant of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I think -- I -- I didn't used to be this way, I think I was more in <span class="DLF">line</span> with -- with my mother’s expectations of -- of a more ordered society, but given what I do for a living and seeing the tremendous variety of -- of family behaviors, and the -- the treatment that people visit upon one another and upon their children, I’ve become much more tolerant and -- and accepting of the variations in those behaviors. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">It doesn’t mean I approve of all of them, I just think I’m more willing to accept them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  And to finish that up and then we should probably move onto your wife and speak a little bit more about --
ANSWER:  Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">QUESTION:  -- how you got your own family. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">But it would be interesting for me to know, which of the kind of cultural movements, or political events at that time, in the 60’s and 70’s were of particular importance to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Any kind of particular impact? </span><span class="sentence" id="434">December 13, 2001
ANSWER:  Wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Outside of my -- my knowledge of the Holocaust, which of course is something that one -- one couldn’t escape, living with a -- a -- a survivor, whether it was my mother, who was always ready to talk about things, or with someone who is more reticent. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">If you’re asking about the historical developments that I was exposed to as a child, as a general matter, I would be happy to answer your question. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I think that the desegregation movement of the 1960’s, which was in large part sparked by educational desegregation decision by the Supreme Court in Brown versus Board of Ed., </span><span class="sentence" id="438">in 1954, I believe, just before I was born, but not implemented until the re -- tru -- not implemented it really in fact and in detail until al -- the great society, Lyndon Johnston administration, really, really affected me strongly as to my sense of -- of equality, for opportunity for all people. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I was highly, highly upset at the -- at Martin Luther King’s death, much more so than at Robert Kennedy’s death, which we -- they were both in the same season, I mean, I remember them both well. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I think the reason for this was th-that I, even as a child, and I would have just been 12 years old then, viewed Martin Luther King as -- as a champion of -- well, obviously he was a champion of civil rights, but I mean a -- a champion of rights without being a revolutionary. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And in a way that was more inclusive and less divisive than many other people would have been in seeking the same overall goals. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">What I think was interesting in my outlook at -- at least wh-when I look back as -- December 13, 2001 as a sort of revisionist, now, 1s that the desegregation movement of -- of the 60’s, in- in particular Martin Luther King’s work, begat a lot of equal opportunity, equal employment opportunity and other e-equal housing opportunity, equal health opportunity, equal educational opportunity movements in the 60’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">The desegregation of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> I agreed with and I still do to this day, wholeheartedly. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">But I think that in affirmative action on the job, and in -- and in recruitment for -- for higher education, I think -- I thought then that it was perhaps a necessary thing, but I’m coming to think now, after it’s been a good 40 years of such programs, that perhaps the time has come as a matter of -- of social justice and to be more inclusive of all other types of peoples who’ve come here in the years since the 60’s and have re-colored, both literally and figuratively the face of -- of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> in particular, that opportunity be based on merit and achievement, rather than on a blind consideration of a person’s color or ethnic or religious background. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And I say this even as a person who 1s the child of a survivor who was offered opportunities when she came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I think what is different 1s that even children of survivors -- I shouldn’t say children, even -- even we children of survivors who have parents who came here, saw that these parents, many of whom came over without education, without any bul -- physical belongings, without any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Literally with just a carry-on bag 1n their hands, and a -- as they say, a hope in their December 13, 2001 hearts, were able to educate themselves, make careers, make families and raise those families and support themselves, while there are many others in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , who -- nowadays, who one can say have equal opportunity, but it is my view, independently choose, and willingly in -- choose to not exercise those opportunities in -- wi-with even one-tenth the drive or ambition that the Holocaust survivors did a mere 50 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I think that’s a -- a very, very important comparison and in some ways drives my changing outlook on affirmative action. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Because I feel that there are just so many immigrants who come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> now who are willing to work hard for themselves, as did our parents, that they all have the equal opportunity to do the same sorts of things that our parents did for themselves and their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And I -- I really don’t feel at this point, that the government should be requiring as a matter of law, or -- or monetarily subsidizing those who a-are not willing to exercise the rights and opportunities available to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION:  I don’t have a connection to your wife yet, so we are just jumping.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER:  Sure, no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">There doesn’t have to be a connection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">QUESTION:  I was [indecipherable] I wanted to --
ANSWER:  Iam connected to my wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  Yeah, that’s good. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I just wanted to have a little break in there too, because as a public speaker, you -- you need a break now and then -- December 13, 2001
ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">QUESTION:  -- but this is good. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">No, that was a very powerful statement, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Let me think. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">What was the attr -- so we are moving back to your wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">What was the attraction? </span><span class="sentence" id="462">What did you like about her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">ANSWER:  Oh, just as a person, she -- I mean, physically she was very, very cute, but that -- that of course is -- is at first blush, I’m saying that’s only when you s -- when you would see her from a distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">But intellectually we found that there were many <span class="REGION">areas</span> where we overlapped, 1 -- particularly with our love of classical literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I really like the <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span> , and outdoor activities, something with the boy scouts, and that th-the -- then my great sports hobby of alpine skiing brought to me, and I continue to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Cheryl loved the performing arts, and was always in love with participating in and viewing the performing arts, dance and <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> in particular, dance even in more particular. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">But I really have grown to love the performing arts. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I liked them, as many of us do, but through her I -- I gained a unique appreciation o- of the performing arts in the insider’s perspective, as have our children, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And it -- through me, I suppose she has gotten to like a bit more, if she didn’t freeze so much outdoor, many of the o-outdoors things that I brought to our relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Of course, we shared the commonality o-of being Jewish and being the children of survivors, but we’ve discussed that a -- a bit before. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Both -- both of us really do December 13, 2001 love -- or I should say did then, and now do love literature, though, and it -- it’s something that it drives our family to this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">QUESTION:  Did you get involved at all in the Second Generation movement or events there? </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Did you feel drawn to that, n -- know about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  We knew about it, and at one point, just after I got out of law school in 1980 or °81, we attended a -- a survivor -- children of survivor’s conference, it was held down at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">NYU</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">But basically, and I -- I would assume in large part because of -- of my Uncle Miles’s involvement with Holocaust a -- research, education, memorial activities, and because a-all of our family are survivors or children thereof, I haven’t really felt compelled to join in with others. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">It’s -- it’s just sort of come to us naturally, and we haven’t had to make any specific moves to get more involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">QUESTION:  Okay, I’d like to have a few facts now. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">When did you get married, what year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  We got married on September seventh of 1980, right here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION:  Was it important to you to have children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  Yes, it was, I -- I really like working with children a lot, and I’ve been involved in the scouting movement since I -- I was a little, little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">However, my wife really wanted to foster her career first. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">So we sort of comprised, and our first son Max was born in 1989, his birthday is January 27", 1989 and he’s currently in the December 13, 2001 seventh grade, and our second child was born nine years thereafter. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">So Joseph was born on December 20" of 1997, and he is currently in <span class="BUILDING">pre-school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">QUESTION:  You’re always giving me these neat little links. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">So how about education? </span><span class="sentence" id="487">How -- how did you want to bring your children up? </span><span class="sentence" id="488">You in this case both, Cheryl and you, or the differences. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Did you have sort of similar ideas of what the values were, or what the aspirations you had for your children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">ANSWER:  Yes, in-indeed, I-I think our greatest hope 1s -- is that our children would grow up to be both literate and concerned beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Aside from formal education, which Pll discuss in a minute, I think a very unique portion of -- of Max’s upbringing, meaning our older son’s upbringing was the fact that during his formative years, Cheryl was a senior staff member at New York City ballet. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And at that time we lived directly across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , literally a 15 second commute from her <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in the New York State Theater at <span class="BUILDING">Lincoln Center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Max grew up basically as the New York City Ballet Company mascot. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">He and I were there every day because my wife worked evenings and we would go to say hello to her, but not only to her, to all of her staff members and to the many members of the orchestra, and the dance company, with whom we became friends over the years. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And she was there from 1985 to ’95, and Max was born, as I said, in January of ’89. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">So he had his first six years at the ballet, backstage, in the <span class="DLF">orchestra pit</span> , in the flies, playing hockey in the December 13, 2001 <span class="INT_SPACE">back hallways</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Hanging out at the <span class="BUILDING">dance bar</span> and making believe he was -- he was a little nutcracker prince with some of the world famous prima ballerinas. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">It was a most unusual thing for a child to be exposed to this quantity of the performing arts on a day to day basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">The funny thing is that nowadays he enjoys going to these things very much, and is even actually -- last night he said to me, hey Dad, we’ve gotta go see The Nutcracker. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Because that’s -- that’s a performance that he adored as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">But he is not willing to perform. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">He doesn’t feel that he has any talents either in music or in dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">However, on the other hand, he’s a phenomenal athlete and he’s discovered in himself talents which I know I never had, and perhaps he inherited somehow from his Uncle Paul. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">But my -- my older son is physically gifted, and he plays league sports 1-1n -- in many different <span class="REGION">areas</span> and is particularly good in the hockey sports. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And he plays league ice hockey, league roller hockey, he’s just a -- a phenomenal athlete. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And he’s -- he’s very proud of himself and he’ ll never fail to tell you, I’m -- you know, proud papas tal -- talk this way all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">But he -- he’Il remind you of that as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">QUESTION:  What about the formal education? </span><span class="sentence" id="509">He is --
ANSWER:  Okay, formal education. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">When he was in <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> , I suppose you call it, pre-K at the <span class="BUILDING">Westside Montessori school</span> , it was -- 1t was somewhat apparent to us that he might be a gifted child, and we had him tested, and were fortunate enough to December 13, 2001 find that he’s a superlative gif -- superlatively gifted child. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And he was accepted to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> public school program for -- for truly a-advanced children, and I’m no-not -- I’m n-not saying this in -- in any way to make him sound better than other children, it’s just a fact that that’s -- that’s the whole definition of -- of the program he was in, it’s called the Anderson program, and it -- and there are two programs like it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , Anderson program on the <span class="REGION">west side</span> and Hunter College high school has its own program which goes all the way down to <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> on the <span class="REGION">east side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And so Max went to and attended the Anderson program and he graduated from there after the fifth grade and took an exam to get into another gifted program for <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> level, that’s called the Delta program. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And it’s -- it’s -- basically it’s the same kids and others who have joined them in a slightly larger program that he had gone to <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> with. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And he’s now in the seventh grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">He is getting a -- a regular, although accelerated and perhaps a bit more in depth <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> education. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">He’s doing very, very well, he -- this particular child, it’s within his personality to be most competitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">He is -- I think if I had to descri -- use one word to describe my own -- this particular child, I would say it’s competitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">He has to be a medalist, meaning he has to get the gold, or the silver or the bronze, and he’s very happy to get any one of them, although everyone wants the gold, but he’s happy to get them. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">But no matter December 13, 2001 whether it’s in sports, or in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , he has to be a winner, he has to be a medalist. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And that’s the way he does in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and that’s also the way he does in sports. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">So I think it’s very interesting that this child has grown to be so highly competitive in personality.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">QUESTION:  The other little guy is about four now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">ANSWER:  Yes, he’s going to turn four next Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">QUESTION:  Is -- is -- is th -- is he different from the first child [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  He’s very different in personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">He, unfortunately for him was not raised in New York City ballet, but I don’t think that that changed his personality in any way, but I just think it’s a significant difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Joseph is not as comp -- a-as competitive or driven a child as Max. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">He has a very sweet and -- and jovial personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">He’s always smiling and singing little songs to himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">He’s not as -- although he’s coordinated about the same as any other child, average child of his age group, he’s not as overtly physically active with such -- such unbelievable both gross and athletic motor skills that -- that his brother has and had even at age four. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">This is a child who really -- this one really loves stories and loves being read to, and loves imagining and loves creating <span class="INT_SPACE">play spaces</span> and games and environments, as you can see from our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , it’s -- we’re surrounded her by -- by Legos and -- and little -- little scenaria o-of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and <span class="DLF">construction sites</span> and -- and letters and he December 13, 2001 does these things every single day. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Actually Max at that age, although interested in things -- he loved <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , he loved model <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and he loved <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that went around, as Joe does, but he wasn’t as interested in building these little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> and environments that you see here, as Joe is, and he’s -- this is the way Joe is, this is the kind of child he is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">QUESTION:  How do they relate to your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">ANSWER:  Oh wonderfully. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">They relate -- they relate very, very well to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Th-They -- I-I can’t say in any way that there’d be anything negative, she’s their grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">She’s very grandmotherly to them, and they’re very grandchildly to her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">QUESTION:  Well, let me rephrase this, I didn’t mean how did they relate, I just say, what’s the relationship between, how do they like each other, do they -- do they talk -- do- does sh -- does she talk to the oldest one about parts of her past already?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">ANSWER:  She does, but he -- it isn’t something that they talk with any frequency about. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">He is quite aware, prob -- in more so and in more detail about my mother’s background than I was about her background at his age. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">The reason is that Cheryl and I have always in -- been believers in -- in being very upfront with Max, we’re much more open and less protective of him, and -- and eventually of Joseph than my mother was of me and Paul. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">My mother was very careful, I’m -- I’m certain, not to traumatize me or Paul with things that she viewed as inappropriate for a given age. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">December 13, 2001 And a-as -- as you’ve interviewed her, I’m sure you can agree that -- that sh-she may have said that to you, or you may have read it into what she said, but I-I’m sure you’d agree with the statement I just made. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">On the other hand, perhaps to his detriment, perhaps to his benefit, I don’t know, I have been very, very upfront with Max, not only about my mother’s background, but about everything that I do at work, about everything in the world, both the good, a -- things and the horrors of living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">The sufferings of people, crime, death, disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I -- I -- we really don’t hide anything from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">That may or may not be good for him in the long run, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I’ve tried to encourage him to be independent. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">He was the first of all of his friends to travel on his own through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I have entrusted him since th-the fourth grade, basically, with being on his own and shifting for himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I expect him to lead his friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I -- I’ve always tried to foster in him the ability to lead not only himself, but his friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">To be responsible for himself and his friends, to keep a lookout for himself and his friends, to protect them, but to achieve. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And the funny thing is that things 1-in many ways have gone that way, and among his friends, whether by dint of his upbringing here, or the fact that he 1s among the older of the children in his age group, or a combination of those factors, he is looked upon by the other children as a sort of a social hub, a leadership figure. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And perhaps it’s because he’s so involved in sports and the boys follow him in that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">December 13, 2001 Perhaps it’s because he actually is very talented in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">That he’s getting homework help calls all the time, and his guidance is sought as to what 1s expected of them in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">It’s just that he -- he’s grown up to be a very unusual child in that regard. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">The downside of this is that his tolerance for others and his patience with them sometimes wears a little bit thin. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">So I think that these might be the sorts of responsibilities that a 12 or 13 year old boy shouldn’t have thrust upon him. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">But he handles it pretty well overall, and -- and -- and his friends love him. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">He has a whole crowd of -- of friends that are hanging out here all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">One, we’ve always tried to make th-the other kids feel welcome around our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so that they -- they -- they should always feel they have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to come, if they want to sleep over, or they want to hang here, have dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Whatever they want, they’re welcome to stay, it’s fine by me. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And it’s alway -- it’s fine by Cheryl, too, it’s -- it’s fine by all of us, but we -- we always want our children to have their friends welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">QUESTION:  That seemed to be the same way that your mother handled your friends, if I s -- if I recall.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  Oh, absolutely, she always encouraged u-us to -- to bring <span class="BUILDING">home</span> other -- other -- you know, it’s usually boys that -- but to bring <span class="BUILDING">home</span> other children a-and to have relationships with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">In -- in -- she also encouraged us and my father did as well, 1-1n boy scouting, that -- I think that was a movement that was very much in December 13, 2001 tandem, since it’s a slightly more conservative movement, especially in the 60’s, than the rest of -- of society at large. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">It was probably very much in <span class="DLF">line</span> with her expectations about the way boys should be reared. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And because of that she allowed and encouraged both me and Paul to continue in scouting. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Both of us achieved the rank of Eagle Scout, and actually to this day I’m involved in boy scouting. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I am now one of the directors of the same group that I was in as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And Max was involved in cub scouting and started in boy scouting, but since the last year in <span class="BUILDING">junior high</span> , I think his interests have changed and his social group has changed, and I’m certainly not going to force his continuation in scouting upon him. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">I just think that this 1s an interest that has sort of fallen out with Max, perhaps for the good, perhaps not, but I’m certainly would -- I wouldn’t force my children to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">So right now Max is not involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">But that’s okay too, he’s involved in so many other things, whether it be 1n sports, social affairs, or his Bar Mitzvah studies, that I don’t even think he has <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in his life for the boy scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">That might be better for him right now.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="581">ANSWER:  That’s o -- I-I can answer that very directly and specifically. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Personally, I have never been to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and I’ve never had the good fortune to have the time to get there 1-1n a way that I would have liked. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">However, my wife has been to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> several times, in large part because, as I said, her -- her father had an oldest sister who had -- who had immigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in the 1930’s as part of a -- a-- a Zionist [indecipherable] movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And because she had this one aunt there, Cheryl had gone there throughout her childhood to visit the aunt and uncle and cousins, along with her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">However, we have traveled, indeed, extensively, all through Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And in the summer of 1984, while <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was still a Communist country, we went to visit <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , to visit the few relatives that Cheryl’s mother still has there, and also to tour where my mother and where Cheryl’s father had grown up, and to visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">That’s what we did there for a -- a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I went with Cheryl and her sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">None of us had any children in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And -- and her mo- her mother went as well, but did not tour with us, she just stayed with her relatives while Cheryl, Marilyn and I traveled about and -- and saw the various <span class="BUILDING">venues</span> that I had mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">December 13, 2001

ANSWER:  Yes, certainly, I -- I think an appreciation for it has. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I know 1-1n particular my mother 1-is most proud o-of -- of Frederick Chopin a-a-and his work, but i -- I love classical music in general and have always loved Chopin. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I just mention that because I -- I -- I -- I -- among the many, many, many types o-of classical music and performing arts that my mother enjoys, that is one person from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> of whom she is particularly proud. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">But I -- I do appreciate Polish culture very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">With -- with some degree of frequency we -- we sh -- meaning -- our immediate family here tried to visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish neighborhood</span> , we have hired a -- a nanny for our little Joe, hi- his daycare provider when he 1s not in <span class="BUILDING">preschool</span> , who happens to be from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And Cheryl’s -- Cheryl’s mother also unfortunately now is suffering from Alzheimer’s, but we have hired for her a caretaker from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">We -- so we -- we have many Polish influences around us all of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">It’s -- it’s just -- it’s just part of the way I -- I grew up, I mean, we -- we enjoy Polish food, Polish music, but I -- I don’t think that we are involved in any way with what -- what are classical Polish American activities, but rather we have a definite consciousness of the background o-of three out of our four parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">December 13, 2001
QUESTION:  Do you feel -- and I’m kind of jumping a little bit now because we have done, chronologically, everything pretty much, I think, so now I just have a few follow up questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Do you feel that children of survivors have a special obligation or a special role to play, from your perspective?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">ANSWER:  Well I -- I -- I most certainly ascribe to -- to my uncle’s declared intention of -- of educating others about what happened in the Holocaust so that -- so that people are, for all of the rest of history, aware that such -- such intense and organized evil could be perpetrated on -- on a -- a discrete population in so short a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I also ha- have tried in my professional career, to spend as much of my time as possible, helping refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Since I started at this -- at this <span class="BUILDING">agency</span> -- when I say at the administration for children’s services, then known as HRA, whatever, but it doesn’t matter, at this same <span class="BUILDING">agency</span> , which is the foster care agency for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , I started there in January 1983, I have been the sole attorney assigned to deal with refugee and immigration issues for children who find themselves in New York City foster care. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">This began because in 1983, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> -- this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> [indecipherable] was a part of the official U.S. government refugee assistance program that was -- started to resettle people from <span class="REGION">southeast Asia</span> in the wake of the Vietnam conflict, and they were taking both families and unaccompanied refugee minors from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camps</span> in <span class="REGION">southeast Asia</span> and resettling them either in the December 13, 2001 community or in various <span class="BUILDING">foster care agencies</span> throughout the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">This -- they were joined shortly thereafter by a large influx of people from the Cuban and Haitian boatlifts in the very early 1980’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">So already by the mid-1980’s, our population and our program was -- was largely made up of children from <span class="REGION">southeast Asia</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Cambodia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Laos</span> , and also from <span class="COUNTRY">Haiti</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> .</span></p>

QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Harry Gelb. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">This is tape number one, side B, and we continue with activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="612">ANSWER:  As I was telling you a -- a moment ago, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ’s refugee program had largely a southeast Asian and then some Haitian and Cuban children in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">We eventually placed about 1400 children through federal referrals into that program. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">However, as I worked during the 1980’s, it became readily apparent that this being <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and all, there were children in the foster care system due to abuse and neglect, here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , who hailed from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Some of these children were entitled and continue to be entitled to immigration law relief, and there are December 13, 2001 special federal laws that --that assist children who find themselves in the foster care situation without having parents willing to help them to realize 1-immigration benefits. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">So even though the federally funded refugee program has basically petered out, and out of about the 1400 children, all of them have aged out, meaning have gone over the age of 21, except for three children who came over when they were very, very small, we now have hundreds of children that I have been able to identify, out of the 30,000 children in the foster care system now, who have immigration law needs that I am able to service. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And I have found overall, 1-it -- through my very fortunate participation with all of these children, that refugee children tend to be very, very driven, very, very self-reliant and very, very motivated to make something of themselves and to utilize the opportunities that are offered them by placement in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> ’s foster care system. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Basically, in lay terms one can say they’ve got free <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , board and education through their 21* birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">As long as they continue to make something of themselves, to attend <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , to get an after-school job, and to basically just grow and become good human beings, they can stay with us until they’re 21 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And 1-1-it’s much to their credit and much to my constant amazement and joy that these children continue to flourish despite the fact that many other children in our foster care system never seem to achieve much in their lives and unfortunately end up many December 13, 2001 times in the same sort of conditions that their parents had when the children ended up in foster care. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">So it’s -- 1t’s very, very much of a pleasure for me to be involved with this refugee population.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">QUESTION:  You’re involved in a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">You are also a good cook? </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Tell -- what -- what --

QUESTION:  -- what -- what -- what are little hobbies? </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I mean, I don’t know how you take the time to do anything, but what do you do for fun?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">ANSWER:  Quite frankly, I -- I do very, very little for -- for fun, myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I don’t get to see my friends very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Most of my activities are involved around providing care for, or joining in the activities of each of my two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And it’s becoming increasingly demanding as little Joseph, now being a-age four, is starting to have a broader circle of friends and different interests and activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I am now challenged with keeping up with both Max’s activities, whether that is his ice hockey or his soccer or his swimming or his basketball, and Joe’s new circle of friends and activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Is -- it’s -- 1t’s always -- always a challenge, always fun.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">QUESTION:  Wh-What about their Jewish education? </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Is there anything particular?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Max has, I believe since either the first or second grade, been attending <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> , and Joseph, who is in his last year of <span class="BUILDING">pre-school</span> now, December 13, 2001 just started <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> two months ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">We belong to a <span class="BUILDING">neighborhood synagogue</span> and Max is currently studying for his Bar Mitzvah which 1s going to be in February of the year 2002.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">QUESTION:  Any particular holidays that you especially like, or any family rituals that happen for some reason?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">ANSWER:  If you’re speaking about Jewish holidays, 1-1-in particular it has always been my joy and distinct pleasure in celebrating Passover with the Lerman cousins, so to speak and aunt and uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="639">This is what we did as children, we meaning Paul and I. We always went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> for Pesach, always, and it 1-1- is perhaps my, and I -- I’m sure it is many other children’s favorite holidays, but celebrating the -- the escape to freedom of the Jewish people from enslavement in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">But just being with that family at that time of year has always meant something very special for me, and -- and I know it has for my brother Paul as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And we continue to go there every year and I bring my children and my wife down to spend a Lerman Passover with them, an-and I’m glad to say that they enjoy it as well.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="647">ANSWER:  I don’t think en-enough can ever be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">I-I-I’m also pleased to see that <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> like the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> a-are conscious of other holocausts, such as those suffered by some of the Cambodian survivors that I worked with in the early 1980’s who -- who ended up being shipped from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camps</span> there to here. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I mean, I think that the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> has a tremendous consciousness for the sufferings of others that a-are similar to or parallel to those that befell my mother and her family and my wife’s father and his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And it’s a -- a very important thing to all of us in our family that there be Holocaust education and Holocaust awareness inculcated throughout the American educational system at all levels, fr-from grade school on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">QUESTION:  In gen -- sort of general terms, or particular, whatever, what do you feel has been the impact of the Holocaust on your mother and on you, as the son, as this -- the next generation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="652">ANSWER:  That’s a -- that’s a very broad question, but I’m not criticizing you for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I will try to answer it as succinctly as possible, so that should take three or four hours -- no seriously --
QUESTION:  Fine, go ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">December 13, 2001
ANSWER:  I’m sure, to use the lay word baggage, that my -- that my mother and every Holocaust survivor carries with them baggage, some of which they -- this psychological baggage, th -- damage, or benefits, whatever, that some of them may recognize and -- and others don’t even recognize it, it -- that will always be in their subconscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">But I think my mother has made a distinct effort to -- as many others have, to rise above her experiences, to evaluate them, to see what -- what good she can identify in her experiences and what evil she can identify 1-1-in her experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">To identify the moral values of -- of what she -- what she learned through those experiences, and through seeing the loss of her family and the rebirth of an entire generation, and now s-succeeding generations o-of -- of Jews in the post-Holocaust world. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I know my mother states all of the time, just straight out, that people shouldn’t allow even the most negative events in their life, to drag them down. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">But on the other hand, I -- I -- I’m sure she recognized that one cannot but have that happen, even if you make every conscious effort to prevent it from being so. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">Yet, a- I-I know that my mother has always tried to -- to look back on -- on that era with an objective -- as objective as possible, historical eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And not to become too emotionally distraught when either e-evaluating or we -- those experiences, or relating them to others. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And I -- I think that her sisters share with her those goals December 13, 2001 about overcoming their experience and -- and have -- all three of them, I think, have tried to pass that on to the -- to my cousins, so to speak, to their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">QUESTION:  What about you? </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I mean, I know it’s not an easy question, but if you kind of, you know, thought about it for a minute, what do you think the impact of the Holocaust was on you, however directly or indirectly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">ANSWER:  I think that in many ways, I mean, directly, and I -- I suppose it’s easy to say that- that it -- it -- it awakened a degree of social consciousness 1n me. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">But I think o-o- other people are motivated by other <span class="NPIP">things</span> and arrive at -- at the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I find myself, but perhaps -- for me this is -- this is what -- what does it. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">I think it uncanny that I met and then married someone who 1s the -- like me, a -- a -- a child of -- of survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Yeah, I don’t know whether that is good or bad, I think it’s a very unique bond. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I -- I found in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and now I’m -- I’m a supervisor in -- in -- in our <span class="BUILDING">Bronx office</span> , and through conversation after being there a year, I found out that one of my co-workers, who is significantly younger than me 1s also the child of a survivor who was a hidden child. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And he was hidden as a very, very -- he’s even younger -- he was born sometime in the 1930’s and waited a while to have children after coming here and marrying, so this co-worker of mine 1-1s significantly younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And yet, I know that -- that she and I feel an -- an -- sort of there’s an unusual kinship or bond there, even though his -- his, meaning her father’s December 13, 2001 experience, wartime experiences, and my mother’s were -- were quite dissimilar. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">But 1-1-1t’s an unusual bond. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I am sure that other people who share similar traumatic experiences in their family histories probably feel a similar bond as well, but this is what our family feels, and this is what Laura’s family feels. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And I’m sure that -- you know, and my wife and her sister and all of my cousins, we all feel the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">It’s just an unusual way to identify -- I think that there are many Jews who identify as being Jews in large part due to the persecution of the Jews during the Holocaust somehow awakening a Jewish identity in them. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I suppose religious motivation comes from many different things in one’s upbringing. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">So in mine, obviously, it must come in large part due to the fact that my mother herself 1s a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Never -- nevertheless, 1-it ca -- her experiences cannot but have a-affected my outlook on the world, on religion, on my social values and morals, and by the way I raise my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And the fact that my wife is also a survivor’s child will only magnify the impact -- or whatever impact it does have on our children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">QUESTION:  I think I probably would have a couple of more questions, but at this point I think this was a pretty good ending, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Do you feel that something important has not been addressed? </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I mean, take a second to just think if there’s something that you want to say, or something that I should have asked and didn’t, that was kind of important to your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">December 13, 2001
ANSWER:  I don’t think there’s any particular thing that you -- you haven’t asked about my background, or about my wife’s background. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">I think it is important, however, that Holocaust information be memorialized in the coming years as the generation of survivors grows older and older, they obviously are going to pass away. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And without them there is going to be no true firsthand source of evidence and of fact about what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And the Holocaust deniers and the present persecutors of Jews, and bigots and hate-mongers will only find fuel for -- for their intolerance should there not be amassed the -- the proper history and documentation of the Jewish people during the Holocaust years. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">So my overall wish would be that all of us, both the current living survivors and their descendants try now to somehow memorialize and record these historical facts so that subsequent generations can benefit from a true rendition of what happened during the 1930’s and 40’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">QUESTION:  Why did you agree to do this int -- why do -- why did you agree to do this interview?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">ANSWER:  In many -- ob-obviously, the -- the fact that this is something that 1s important to my mother weighed on me, but even if it were not, e -- I would gladly -- even if my mother weren't a survivor, if I was just, let’s just say a -- a child of American Jews, and you’d come to ask me about how the Holocaust bore on -- on my development a-and life today, I would have gladly participated because I think that the -- the December 13, 2001 events of such a mass tragedy weigh so heavily on the development of -- o-of world culture that they -- they should be documented and interpreted. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I think that what’s going on today as we speak, in -- in the -- a-as Bush calls it, the war against terror, but 1-1t -- 1t’s basically a -- a war against terrorists who hate <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and hate Jews, is very much involved in -- in interpretation of facts of the Holocaust and how the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> came into being as a result of the persecution of the Jews during the Holocaust. [</span><span class="sentence" id="690">indecipherable] talking about the political state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> as opposed to the Jewish settlement of the land of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="691">These are very important things and have affected the Islamic world’s view o-of Jews and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in the years since the end of World War II.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">QUESTION:  What is your own position in regard to that -- to what is going on right now in terms of isga -- <span class="COUNTRY">Afghanistan</span> and war against terrorism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="693">ANSWER:  Well obviously, I-I -- I have absolutely no tolerance for terrorists of any kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">That -- and that would go for -- for terrorists that are advocating or -- or bombing to convince people to believe in any particular area of thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">However, because so much o-o-of this current terror campaign 1s involved in a hatred of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and of th-the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and Jews, I do have very strong opinions. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And it is my unfortunate belief that although -- and I say unfortunate because I -- I -- I’m sad to find myself feeling this way, although I ha -- I have tremendous fondness for many December 13, 2001 people who are -- are Muslim, and who live here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , like myself, I quite frankly, based on their religious beliefs, and the -- and their culture, do not believe that they will ever -- th-the Islamic world will ever be able to accept the existence of the state of Israel. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">They -- they -- I -- I think that much of their hatred is tantamount -- although it 1s worded differently than Hitler’s hatred of the Jews, I think it’s tantamount to Hitler’s hatred of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And although the -- the current terrorists will never be able to perpetrate the mass execution o-of Jews, as -- as Hitler and the Nazis were, I still think that were that to be a thing within their grasp, many of these people would not hesitate to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I -- even -- even among Muslims of a -- a more gentle persuasion who are not violent like -- like the terrorists, I really -- I-I sincerely question whether even they, based upon their doctrine and their beliefs and their culture will ever able to be accept -- to be able to accept the fact of the existence of a Jewish state in the land of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And I think that these hatreds are so deep seated, and -- and so old, going back now thousands of years, that I don’t -- I -- I -- I sa -- it’s sad to say, I don’t feel that they can ever be overcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">I don’t know what to do about it, but you ask me how I feel about what’s going on now, and this is actually how I feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">It -- it -- it -- it’s very hurtful to me, it’s very hurtful to my family, it’s something that affects all Americans, not just Jews, a-as you could see from the tragedies on -- on September December 13, 2001 11. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">So the fact that terrorists have identified <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> f -- e-either for its support of the state of int -- of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , or as a land of moral turpitude, or as a some sort 0-0-of hated kingdom, for whatever reason I don’t understand, it does affect every American, and 1-1-it is an <span class="REGION">area</span> th-that all people 1-in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> should consider each day of their life.</span></p>
