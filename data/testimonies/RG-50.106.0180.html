ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">So let’s talk now, what happened after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">What — where did you go after liberation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  After the liberation, there was a small group of women, and we were liberated by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">They took very good care of us, they supplied us with food, with clothes, because we were almost clothes-less. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Nothing that we had on was a sack. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">No shoes, no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">The Russians supplied us with everything they could, but it didn’t take us long — w-we stayed in a group, maybe eight or 10 women — girls mostly, young women. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And must be we ate too much food, or the dirt, because we were invaded by — by lice, and two days, three days after, everybody fell sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And by being sick, the Russians were afraid to come near us, and we didn’t know what March 1, 2010 was wrong with us, because we probably had high temperature, and none of the girls was probably normal, and didn’t know what happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">But when the Russians didn’t come near us, we kept on asking, why don’t we get any help, or anything, to make us well? </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And we were told, either there were nurses, or they were — I— Is — to this day I don’t know who the people were who took care of us, that we have typhus fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And nobody want to come near us, because they were afraid, the military, that they might get sick, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">There was one woman who had a daughter my age.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  You — you were 20 years old at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Yes, I was 20 years old at the time, yes, I — and there was one woman, as I say, and she spoke a little Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">She ran out to get help, so we can go to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Soon after, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> with a German came, horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , and they put us all ona <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , and supposingly we went to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">But it wasn’t a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , it was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> converted into a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , because there were many other women from other areas, which I — I —I still don’t know where they came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And they put hay on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and we were laying on the hay, with no pillows, with no nothing, but all we wanted is help. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">The Russians did a lot for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  A-Are you still near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> , still, at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Yeah, that was, yes, near the <span class="REGION">area</span> where I was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I can’t account the time, but after a while, they took us to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , which was better than the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , March 1, 2010 the <span class="BUILDING">school hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And at that time we saw already Russian doctors, Russian nurses. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">But the Russians were so bitter, so upset, that they couldn’t even — even stand if a German ca — if German woman or man came to help, to be on the same <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> at the time when they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Because the Russians suffered a lot too, from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And supposingly, I have no idea, but we tried to figure out why the Russians were so mad at the Germans, that after, when we came back to ourselves, when we — we — we were sick for two months. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So I cannot count the time when we felt better, but I assume maybe a month, maybe six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">We kept on asking why the Russians are so mad at the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And they said, they killed our parents, our sisters, our brothers, just as much as they killed your sisters and brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">But, after two months, we were released, and we were told — we were asked where we want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So I said, I want to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> to find out who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And Red Cross took us over at the time, and they brought us back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L6édz</span> was just as bad as the <span class="NPIP">place</span> we came from, which, I don’t know the name of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">We didn’t have anybody, but I found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> which was for me to stay, with some other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And every day we went to check the list of the people who survived, and who came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So I found my sister and my brother also survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But my sister came after to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , but my brother remained in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because he was liberated by the Americans, and that March 1, 2010 was <span class="REGION">German territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And where we were liberated was the <span class="REGION">Russian territory</span> , because <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , everybody took a p — a —a part of, I think the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Shortly after I was reunited with my sister, because knowing — she probably checked the list where she was, I checked the list where I was, and we got reunited, so I was with my sister shortly after.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  Is this still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L6dz</span> , are you —
ANSWER:  And that was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz</span> , yes, and we couldn’t get in touch with my brother, but people who I don’t know what — they were not sick, or they were hiding, used to com — communicate, go places. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So we sent the message, through this person, to my brother, who was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ainring</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldafing</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , that we both survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">We are only two sisters, and we survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">So he sent back a message with somebody, not letters, because at that time that was too early for mail, and 1t was such a mix-up that it’s hard to describe, but everybody just want to know who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">That was the most important thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So the brother sent back the message, and he said, I survived and I am in this particular <span class="NPIP">place</span> , which was Ainring, by Freilassing. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">If you could, come back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , so we can be all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Shortly, when we felt we can travel, and the travel wasn’t that you took a ticket and you went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , or — or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">What — travel, you had to find somebody who took you from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another, until we reached the <span class="DLF">border</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and then March 1, 2010 somebody else would — took us to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where my brother was. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">We — we — we did survive the trip, and we came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which nobody liked to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but we had no other choice, because we couldn’t stay in pol — in portla — in — I’m sorry, in portla — we couldn’t stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> because nobody was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And the <span class="NPIP">place</span> which we lived was torn down, because di — the place where we used to live was very close to the <span class="DLF">gates</span> where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> started in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L6dz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So we reunited, and we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ainring</span> , with my brother and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">We stayed there from ’45 til I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in ’49. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">There I met my husband, and we got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">My sister met her husband in the four years, and my brother got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So we all got married in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the first chance anybody had, they want to go away from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So we all registered to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , to — to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and whichever came first, we — we went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  Were you in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  All this time, these four years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  All those four years, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Some people went to live privately, but we went — we were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And we were by the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So my husband registered for all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> which were available to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">He was a tailor, and my sister and her husband and my brother — so the first to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was my brother, becauseMarch 1, 2010 by choice, I don’t know exactly how it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And we were supposed to go shortly after. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Then, my sister and her husband went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And when they came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , they came right into the war, because they came in °48, from — from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , my brother-in-law was taken to the army, and my sister was left all by herself, and very, very sick and discouraged, because we left one war, and came right into another war. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And I stayed on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because I had a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I ha — I was the first one to have a child from my brother and sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  But your brother and sister were older than you, or —
ANSWER:  Yes, I was the youngest in the family, but I had a child the first. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">My child was born in °47. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I married in ’46, a year later I had my daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And with children, nobody was very happy to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="76"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> didn’t want anybody with children. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">They took only young people, because there was a war, and they wanted people to go to war with no children. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And by that time, my brother was already in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And he said, be patient, wait, and I’m trying to get you to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">That was my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Meantime, there was a opening to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And we were very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">At the time, it was HIAS who was working to — to bring the people to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">But there was a nice family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> , <span class="REGION">Maine</span> , which at that time I didn’t even know what <span class="REGION">Maine</span> was, and they needed somebody to work in a <span class="BUILDING">clothing factory</span> , and my husband signed up as a tailor. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So, we were chosen to go toMarch 1, 2010 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> , <span class="REGION">Maine</span> , and we were very, very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> with a two and a half year old child. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And the man who signed up for us to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> , I — was one of the nicest people. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">He supplied us with an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">My husband was right away paid 40 some dollars a week, which I thought I am a millionaire, because 40 — 40 some dollars at — in — in 49 was a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And we were very happy to be in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So my sister was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , my brother was in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , and I was in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">We were not happy about it, because we want to be together. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So I was the one who was saying, I’m going to start doing something. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Maybe I can bring you to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">My sister said, oh I would like you to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and my brother said, you — I would like you to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">But, it took a long time, and everybody already had settled in the <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they were, so my husband didn’t want to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> , <span class="REGION">Maine</span> , and my sister didn’t want to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and my brother didn’t want to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , so we were all separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> , I had a beautiful life. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">The people were so nice, and they were not all Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Even the Gentile people, they accepted us like we were somebody special. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">They came — they was quite a few families who came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> , but they didn’t stay on, because at that time, the people who came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> , they were single people. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And for single people there wasn’t really much to do in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And the majority left, after a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But three, four — four families were left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> , who hadMarch 1, 2010 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And I came in °49, in ’51 my — my son was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And I already had two children, and life was beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And I realized what a beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> is to be in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And as the years went by, I had another son, who was born in ’57, and this was that, and we were all settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">After my — after five years, my husband worked for this man who signed it up for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">In gratitude, he didn’t want to leave him, but he always want to be on his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So, after five years, pay him back what this man did for us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> , we opened a little <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> for ourselves, which was a tailoring, clothing, like Mom and Pop shop. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And I helped my husband, and we were there for — for almost 40 years, until my husband took sick, and my husband died in 2000. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">After when I — and my kids, meantime got married and moved away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">After 2000, I was left by myself, and very few friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I stayed on for another year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> , in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> , and my daughter who lived in <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> at the time, said — and my son settled in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , and already had families, and my daughter had families. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">They ask me, where do I want to go to be again together? </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So I decide I’m gonna come near my daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And near my daughter, I didn’t want to be in a single <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again, so I have chosen to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leisure World</span> , which I have no regrets, I’m very happy, and I made some new friends and I been living — it’s been nine years since I came to liveMarch 1, 2010 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leisure World</span> , and I hope, God willing, that I will have a few more years, and enjoy life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leisure World</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  Can we go back a little bit now, and I can ask you some questions?</span></p>
