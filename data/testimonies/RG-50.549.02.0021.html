ANSWER:  My name ts Francis Akos, A-k-o-s. We are recording at <span class="BUILDING">Orchestra Hall</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , which is my second <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , being assistant concert master here for the last 44 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">QUESTION:  And you’re about to start the season, I guess, huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  And you just -- you just come back from a tour of Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  We just came back from -- from a scenic tour of Europe and Friday is opening night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  When -- this is jumping ahead some, actually, but since you mentioned you’ve just been in Europe, I imagine, with what you do in life, you go to Europe fairly often?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  Well, it started in ‘71. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Until then the <span class="BUILDING">Chicago symphony</span> was an unknown, great orchestra. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">But ‘71 with Shorty, we went to Europe the first time and since then, several times to Europe and to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">We were all over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  So, you’ve been going back then for, you know, since the early 70’s, it’s a --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  -- quarter of -- quarter of a century.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Quarter of a century, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  What is it like to go back? </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Does it -- does it ever bring up memories of what happened to you during the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Do you ever -- have you ever been to, or near any of those <span class="NPIP">places</span> again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  At ce -- at certain -- at certain times it happened, but generally speaking, not. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">But at one point, when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , I went out to see the -- the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the Caparkone wa -- bombing happened and since then there were some books written and there are -- there is a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> there and I didn’t feel at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> too much when I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We went -- we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and then we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and -- and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , to play a concert each. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">It ba -- it brought back memories, but for some reason, I wasn’t too upset about what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">But as concertmaster of the <span class="BUILDING">Berlin opera house</span> since -- I mean from -- for ‘50 -- f -- ‘50 til ‘54. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I took this as a rehabilitation -- kind of restitution, because I made it -- I play in a proba -- a -- a -- an audition and I ma -- got the job and I lived there for three years, almost four. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And I made some very good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Not -- not all of them were -- were -- were avid Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And they treated me very nicely, so I -- I didn’t have any bad feelings about being back to Euro -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , specifically, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  So you feel like your time in -- in those years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> right after the war, it was almost like there was a timeta --
ANSWER:  Yeah, it is --
QUESTION:  Some sort of reconciliation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  It was -- it was like that, I took it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Some -- some people couldn’t understand how can you live in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">But everybody is little different.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">You mentioned the Caparkone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Ho-How do you spell that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  C-a-p-a-r-c-o -- no, a-r-k-o-n-e. <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Caparkone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Well, in English it’s with a c, I think in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> it was also the same way, the spelling of the -- of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">That was a 37,000 ton <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> - <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">South America liner</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And since then I discovered, by accident, that when the Germans made a f-film of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Titanic</span> , in ‘41, they used this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> for the feeling of that- of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Titanic</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  They made a movie about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Titanic</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  They made they -- they are the -- very famous movie, it was during the war time. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And this is the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> they used.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  We should mention -- I mean you go into description at some length in your interview with the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> --
ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  -- and also with the S-Shoah Foundation, you tell the story of being on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> where they had taken thousands of prisoners, the Germans had put thousands of prisoners on these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">It was right at the end of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  There were three -- three big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bay of Lubec</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And that’s the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> and what we found out afterwards, there was no fuel on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So what they planned with us, nobody knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">M-Most likely, they wanted to do something to -- to get rid of all this per -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> prisoners, but the British took it into their hands on -- on May third. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And they were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And there was about 7,000 who died and maybe 400 who -- who are alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  The British bombed it --
ANSWER:  Who were alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  The British bombed it because everything was going -- going north. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">The -- the -- the Germans were evacuating and -- and sending all the troops further north and they thought that thasat -- these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> are <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport ships</span> for -- for German military. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">But what came out later -- what was found out, that the -- Bannerat, the -- the Swe-Swedish Bannerat -- the Swedish what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  I think he -- he was called Count.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Count. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Yes, Count Bannerat had a meeting with Himmler in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubec</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">That’s where they -- they shipped us in f-from. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">To the -- to the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And he found out that there are sh -- pris-prisoners -- concen-concentration camp prisoners on these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> and by eight o’clock in the morning, the British got the mes-message that don’t bomb these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> because they are innocent survivors of -- of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and the British supposedly said, “It’s too late.” </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And at 2:30 they bombed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  So, coincidences happened, nobody knows what happen -- really caused them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  It’s still being investigated to this day, no?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  It sure is. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">There is a film that was made by a German young man who -- who happened to -- to be spending some vacation time at the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> , and he’s -- heard about that there is a -- a memorial for the Holocaust ma -- victims, 7,000 of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And he started to dig in and -- and look -- look into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And he found ca -- found out all kinds of details and he found a few survivors, including me. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And he made a film at -- a documentary about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Unfortunately, the film is not well known at all, because the English subtitles are not legible. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Very -- they didn’t have enough money to -- to do the right subtitling. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And that’s -- that’s where it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">It was played in -- I mean, it was shown in- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> several ti -- several <span class="NPIP">places</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">But, many people know about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Titanic</span> , everybody knows about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Titanic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Nobody knows about the Caparkone and the Deutschland. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And the Athena, there was three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  And the vast majority of people on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> died.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">There were only -- only about 400 all together that survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And 7,000 are at - known dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So they -- they knew the numbers that -- that were shipped -- put -- put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So this film was done on a very si -- very low budget. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">This is a one man operation, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">The guy is from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and he was trying his best. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">But a -- without enough backing, is not going to be well-known anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So you’re experience actually, on the -- you know, your quote unquote, “Day of Liberation” --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  -- consisted of diving off the side of this --
ANSWER:  Of jumping into the -- into the cold <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> and being lucky enough to be fished out by -- by some little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that was around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and getting into the -- o-on land, when the British came in, that was a -- a -- <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> -- some kind of <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> when we -- we came on -- on <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British tanks</span> were coming in and -- and tearing down the -- the flags. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And then we -- we had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Basically zero. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">What we had on was wet and that -- that was what -- what we owned, the few people who -- who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So the British went into different <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and told the Germans, give these people eat -- to eat, give these people something to wear and shoes and -- and this is how I started my new life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  When -- do you remember, when you were with the British and they were telling Germans to give you something to eat and to give you clothes, I guess, how were the Germans reacting to that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Well, they -- they had no idea what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">They only saw the -- the British come in and they didn’t know what were these wet -- wet people came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">They -- they saw some bombing maybe, but they didn’t know that those -- those -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> prisoners, until they saw them with -- with the hair shor-shorn and no -- well, nobody had anything, but basically, no-nobody has a -- had a piece of paper to -- to prove who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Anyway, the British then -- then gave us some -- some identification cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">But it was hairy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  Hairy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  Very hairy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  In what way”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  In very many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">You -- you didn’t know who you were talking to, whether it was a- a Nazi who -- who was trying to kill you before and who 1s now trying to -- to save his own hide or -- or whether it was somebody who just came off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , by accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Anyway, it was very -- a long time ago, so I can’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Then it was difficult to get - get where you wanted to go, because that -- the French and the Belgians, I think and the Poles sent their -- their people to -- to collect their own people, because there -- they were notified. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But anybody behind the Iron Curtain, like -- like Hungarians and Czechs and -- nobody cared really, but there was a United Nations relief organization, you -- the UNRRA, Unrah, and I had a chance to -- actually, I -- I found somewhere -- I organized myself a -- a violin and through -- through -- through the British, I became a -- a violinist for the officer’s club. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I didn’t know much -- too many British officer songs anyway, but I- I survived somehow and I played a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Of course, it was difficult because -- I spoke a little English, but not -- now, my English is better, my acc-accent is the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">But I had to make myself understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And s-si -- one of the officers helped me to get notification to the Red Cross, because I had an uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ankara</span> who survived the war in - in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And I knew his address. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I didn’t have a chance to send anything to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , because I -- I didn’t know whether my parents were alive or not, first of all and secondly there was no c-communication or -- or mail or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">But through the Red Cross, I -- I sent a note to my uncle, who then notified my parents that I was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So it took four months until I -- I finally got back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Mayas -- with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Czech transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">There was nothing going on for -- for Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But I -- I joined at that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Czech transport</span> and I got back somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">On <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> , on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , on -- had no money, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And then I went to -- to my old <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , not knowing whether my mother is around, or my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">That’s where they -- they deported me from, originally. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And so they were alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And then I became concertmaster of the -- of the Budapest Concert Orchestra. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">They knew it through my mother that I was alive and they were waiting for me, as a -- with -- with that position. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And those were the first few months, everything was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">There was inflation, there was no -- no food, no money, no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Basically, it was terrible times. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And it was basically Russian occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So, we went through all kinds of horror stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">But I played. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I practice, I played and I got back into the swing of things and then I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Some of us felt that the -- the world is open, now that the war is over, the world is open for -- for -- for us talented, good, good instrumentalists, et- etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And we went over to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and then to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and we ha -- we s -- we had a -- with some colleagues, I played in a string quartet and nothing really j-jived. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Because the world wasn’t open. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">In <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , you couldn’t -- couldn’t get a job if you didn’t have nationality -- I mean, didn’t belong to -- even -- even as a -- as a foreigner, if you didn’t have the right kind of papers, you couldn’t get a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So when I went back, I played an audition for the opera. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">They were looking for a concertmaster in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and I got the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I was the youngest concertmaster they ever had in the <span class="BUILDING">Budapest Philharmonic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Twas like -- like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , the Philharmonic and the opera orchestra is the same -- or was the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And I was there for -- for a season, two seasons and somebody who knew me from way back, when I was a student -- this lady was a pianist and she survived the war in -- in- in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And she recommended me for concertmaster to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurterburg</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So I got the passport, I didn’t promise them anything, but I went out to -- to play the audition. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And after I played out the -- the audition and I was -- I got the job, then I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> -- oh, I went back and I got a year of -- va -- leave of absence -- a leave, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And then I never went back, afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I didn’t go back, I went out to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and I was concertmaster in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurterburg</span> for three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Then there was an opening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and they wanted me to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I played an audition again. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I got the job and that’s when I started in the <span class="BUILDING">opera house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">This Shtetisher oper, meaning civic opera, but that was one of the big operas. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They had three in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> -- 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Berlin</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">East Berlin</span> , there were three or four <span class="BUILDING">opera houses</span> , but three of -- three of them were famous. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">The Startsh oper and the Commisher oper was -- were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">East Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">My opera, the Shtetisher oper was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And I never went over to the <span class="REGION">east side</span> , because I wasn’t interested in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I knew -- knew what Communism is and I knew what Russian occupation is, I wasn’t interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But that was an interesting life. </span><span class="sentence" id="154"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Berlin</span> was -- was an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> in -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And that was very good, until I got my American pa -- visa, which took eight -- eight years I was waiting for the American visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And when I got it, I couldn’t say, “No, I don’t come, because I have a good job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  Let me -- before we take up that part of the story, let me ask you a couple questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I’m curious -- you know, you’re -- most -- most of the people that I’ve interviewed who survived the Holocaust, they have very vivid memories of their day of liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And usually it’s soldiers march into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp or</span> they’re -- they’re in hiding and they -- they see the Russians coming or the Americans coming or whatever and it’s a -- it’s a very distinctive experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Now your day of liberation is actually being bombed, scrambling for --
ANSWER:  Much more distinctive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  -- scrambling for you life --
ANSWER:  Just looking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  -- tremendous -- tremendous chaos.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So my -- my question 1s -- do you know, or can you remember, when was -- you know, all these other interviews I’ve done, people say, “And th -- and then, when we went out and met the Russians, then we were liberated.” </span><span class="sentence" id="168">You know, they knew they were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">They -- people knew what their -- that their moment of liberation had come and I’m wondering, when was the time you ever felt that, given how crazy it was that day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  I -- I never really verbalized it, but I suppose it was the time when I saw the English soldiers cam -- coming 1n the -- in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , into this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Ubertshooter</span> -- what is an Ubertshooter -- un -- <span class="BUILDING">submarine school</span> , basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">It was in the <span class="BUILDING">submarine school</span> where -- where the left side of the -- the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> , that we hit <span class="REGION">land</span> with these little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> that helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Not too many. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And at the same time, this Bri-British tanks were coming from the right and those British soldiers took down the Nazi flag that was still o-on -- on the flagpole. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And I suppose that was the time that I was liberated, because now -- now I could speak English to the English soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">So that was -- that was the end of the war for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I didn’t know it’s -- May three is -- is just a date. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And now I know what it was, cause they were -- five more days they -- they went on with the war, but that was almost the ho -- the end.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Yeah, I suppose that was it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  -- y-you say you suppose that was it, sounds like at the time, it didn’t really strike you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  I didn’t -- no, it didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I was wet and cold and I was worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I really didn’t -- didn’t feel liberated, but that was it, cause I was liberated, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">The other 7,000 died.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  Did you ever have any discu -- I mean you s -- you s -- you spoke some English, so I believe in your other interviews, you mentioned that you were able to speak with the British about what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Did you ever --
ANSWER:  Nobody -- nobody really asked me what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">They -- they just -- somehow they- they must have known it from other people, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I probably told them, I don’t remember exactly what -- what I told them, that we were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was bombed, that -- and who we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Maybe I did, but they -- they seem to have known that these are people who should be helped, these are not Nazis coming out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  Did you feel -- you know, the British saved you on the one hand, but had bombed you on the other hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Did you feel grateful, resentful?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  After -- after the fact, I’ve -- I felt very resentful, but I was glad that it was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">It was over because of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">That was a big, big mistake that they made and nobody can explain how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Nobody really could find out details. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">This guy who -- who made the film went all -- all the way to -- to the British command and --
QUESTION:  If you could move --
ANSWER:  -- he interviewed -- he interviewed some of the pilots -- no, that was in the Stern magazine, that was a -- a -- a serial that they had an interview with the pilots and they really did not have any inkling what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">But then when they found out, it was -- they had regrets, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So thousands -- thousands perished and a few hundred were SUIVIVOTS.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  It was very difficult for everybody, basically because -- because of the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">The Russians took as much as whatever could they -- could take out besides the -- the -- the -- the Nazis ruined <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> with street fights. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And I remember when -- when they deported me, first they took us -- that was night -- evening, raids during the day and during the evening, they put -- put together I don’t know how many hundreds of Jews into the big <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> -- that’s the biggest in Europe, the hung -- the -- the <span class="BUILDING">Budapest synagogue</span> , and that’s where we were -- we were kept and during the night, we heard de- demolition sounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">All but one <span class="DLF">bridge</span> -- <span class="DLF">bridges</span> were detonated and -- and there was no connection between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> , other than one that they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And that’s where we went over to the <span class="REGION">Buda side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">In the morning --

<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  So this 1s during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  During the war when -- when the -- the Hungarian Nazis took over the government and they rounded up all the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Most of them into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> , but some of us were deported right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And we walked to vie -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> under -- under guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So that was coming back to -- to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , 1t was ruined by -- by the Germans and it was ruined by the Hungarian Nazis and then it was ruined by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So it was a pretty bad situation, but everybody tried to survive and there was no -- no difference between Jews, non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">We -- we were musicians. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">We played in the orchestra and -- and there was craving for -- for some culture after awhile, but we played in this overcoats because there was no heat. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">So it was a very, very strange situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">QUESTION:  But the Jewish community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> had been devastated, no?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  Yeah, most of it, most of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">The only <span class="NPIP">place</span> where -- where there were some surviving Jews, was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , because of the ghetto situation and there was -- there were some - some <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that were under Swedish and Swiss protection, supposedly. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Well, they took me from a Swedish -- Swedish pro-protected <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">But in general, Jews from the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> were deported much earlier than -- than what happened to me, or us. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And the surviving Hungarian Jews were all either in hiding or in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> that were so- called liberated by the Russians.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  What would -- what did it feel to -- like, to be walking down familiar <span class="DLF">streets</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , where once, you know, you had family, friends and all this life in this community and what was it like then, after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  We didn’t really know too much in the beginning, who survived, who didn’t survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Who was around, who wasn’t around? </span><span class="sentence" id="229">It was a strange world all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And I remember that a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friend of mine, I didn’t see him again, not until just a few years ago, he was in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> and he talked to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I knew his father was 1n the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , walking to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and then on the -- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> wizness going to -- being transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> mayan gummer. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And I saw him die in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="233">He was in the same <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where -- where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So, I didn’t see him when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but I knew certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And I saw one of my friend from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , who became a -- a partisan in -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , fighting on the side of the Russians, against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">He came back with the Russians to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and became a high positioned police officer, who was trying to find and did find th-the Nazis who -- the Hungarian Nazis who were responsible for most of the atrocities that took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So it was strange, it was a very strange world and -- and -- and I left it behind and came back to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">But by then it was a little better, where I was concertmaster in the <span class="BUILDING">opera house</span> , but we still didn’t have peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Not just peace, but bombed out <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and -- and bombed out <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and -- and very little -- very little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">The Russians took as much as was movable, they took. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">They- they dismantled <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> and -- and washing -- wash basins and took them, because most of these -- these so-called soldiers, they have never seen anything that rem - rem -- that is close to co-comfort and that is close to luxury. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">So they -- they got -- they went wild. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They took the watches off -- off your arm and they had -- some of them had five, six watches on their arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Duvi, duvi, that was the -- the word. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Give, give, whatever you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And they took the rings off the fingers of the people and -- and the watches and it was a very strange world, but you know, it just comes to me sporadically, when I talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Otherwise, I don’t think about it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="259">ANSWER:  Well, not that -- not in that vein, what you were just saying, the last sentence. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">It -- you just keep on living. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">But help, yes, because in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , I survived because the -- the guy who was in -- in charge of my <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> -- for some reason, I don’t know why and how he -- he found out that I am playing the violin and -- and there was sudden- suddenly there was a violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And every evening they were -- they were trying to -- to keep up their spirits and they were singing -- there were Polish people, German people, Hungarians, all mixture. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And I was playing the violin for them and this guy liked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">So he really saved my life, basically, because there were transports going out of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and he always saved me. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So that’s sh -- music helped me a lot.</span></p>
