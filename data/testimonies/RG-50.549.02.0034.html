<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Well, first of all, I wanted to go back and ask you a couple of factual questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Th-Th-The names of your mother and your father and your sister and your grandparents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  Okay, my father’s name is Dr. Bruno Deutsch. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">My mother’s name is Eleishka Deutschova, born Hoobervar. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My sister’s name is Zoozanar Holobecova, maiden name Brunova. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">She is sister from my mother’s first marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And my grandparents, was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  From my mother’s side is Dr. Adolf Hoober, grandmother Paula Hooberva, born Klepfnacherva. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">From my father’s side, my grandfather’s name was Samuel Deutsch and my grandmother’s was Jenny Deutschova, born Meyerva.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  Okay, thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">One of the things you mentioned in the video interview was that your grandfather had some poison that you were to have used if things got really unbearable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  When did you find out about the fact that he had this poison and what were the circumstances?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  I do not exactly remember when the subject was brought up. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I simply do not remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">It -- It, in all likelihood was mentioned casually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  But it -- it -- 1t re -- it came up while you were on the run -- while you were --
ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">It wasn’t later, when --
ANSWER:  No, it was -- it was -- it was while we were on the run.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  Do you remember your reaction to finding out about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  No, I don’t remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  Another thing having to do with the video was your time in the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic orphanage</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  And you had said that you weren’t really aware of religion at that age, but there were a lot of different experiences with religion, that you had. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">You had the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic orphanage</span> , you-your own religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Were you aware of -- of your <span class="NPIP">place</span> in any of this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  I do not think that I was bothered by it, because during the war, I was about a half a year or eight months, hidden under assumed name tn -- in the parish of a Lutheran minister, so that somehow I was used to Christianity, as far as that goes. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">But, when I was deposited in that <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , it was already after liberation -- very shortly after liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And my parents made it clear to me that I will be there only a very short time and I can only assume that the nuns were instructed that I’m there only temporarily, for a couple days or weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So they have not tried to impose any of their influence upon me. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">It was like -- like, if you will, to -- to -- to be deposited in a <span class="BUILDING">day care center</span> , if you wish. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">There was one fellow I befriended there, during those few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">He used to -- he spend there a whole war. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">He was Jewish, but he was not circumcised, so there was apparently no way t -- of proving that he was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">But that -- that didn’t have any lasting influence upon me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  When the war ended, you were 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">You were in this <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  And since the video interview stopped at that point --
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  -- perhaps we could pick up the chronology and -- and --
ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  -- talk about that period as the war ended and what was going on in your life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">After some very short time in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , one of my relatives -- and I don’t remember exactly whether it was my sister or my parents, came to pick me up and we came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ungarrishbrote</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uerskibrote</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> from which we fled in 1942, to <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">If I remember correctly, in those -- in that period that I was in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , my parents succeeded having our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> returned to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Because, during the war, our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was occupied by Christians, who were not very pleased, apparently, to vacate the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Because majority Christians who found themselves into those situations, assumed that the Jews have perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">That they will be able to stay there forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So, we returned to our own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I remember, after few days or weeks, I joined the Boy Scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I had got -- got a nasty infection on my foot and had to be operated on and had to be transported for the operation to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ungarishradish</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Werskaradishka</span> , which had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And the only doctor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ungarishbrote</span> who was available, said that because the war has ended such a short while earlier, they didn’t had any ether -- anesthesia, to put me to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So I had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ungarishradish</span> for operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I stayed there a couple of days. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">My father, in the meantime, traveled throughout the <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Mainly -- his <span class="BUILDING">dental office</span> was confiscated by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And the provisional Czech government wanted to return it to him, but of course, the original equipment, God knows where it disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So, the government has said that they will give him a dental equipment left by fleeing Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So he can choose any <span class="BUILDING">dental office</span> that he wants to, with one condition, that the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> will stay in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in which it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And the Czech government promised to find for us an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So, from what I understand, my father looked over about five or six <span class="BUILDING">dental offices</span> and has selected one in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenime</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span> , which is about one hour by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , in <span class="REGION">southern Moravia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And in, I think September of ‘45, we have moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Correction, it must have been later. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">October or November, we have moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And while in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uerskibrote</span> , I started getting private tutoring lessons, because I was still at a compulsory school age. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And the debate was with the school board, whether I should be admitted to a class according to my chronological age or placed in a class according to my academic knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And until that issue was resolved -- because the local school board didn’t had any instructions how to proceed. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So, in the meantime, I was having a private tutor, so I think that during the summer of ‘45, I was spending it with a tutor. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And in September, I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">In the meantime, the ruling was that I had to attend classes according to my chronological age. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So, of course, I was -- I was totally unprepared, after four years -- five years being out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So I -- I always had very poor grades as a result. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And then my father selected the <span class="BUILDING">dental office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span> , so we have moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I remember the travel throughout the <span class="COUNTRY">Czech Republic</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was an ordeal, because th-the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> were not only filthy and dirty, but all the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And it was -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were running, God knows how. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span> -- the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span> , I think at that time, it -- it must have had a population of about 20,000, was heavily scarred from Germans fleeing to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">There were several burn out <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> left over in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">A great part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was in ruins. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And almost all the <span class="DLF">windows</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span> were broken, because allies were bombing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And <span class="BUILDING">Vienna Noiseshtatel</span> , which had apparently <span class="BUILDING">German ammunition factories</span> , and from the vibration of the bombs, the glass of the <span class="DLF">windows</span> simply broke. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So, then I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span> , I think til about 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Yes, in May of 1947, I finished my compulsory educational requirements, which at that time, were nine grades. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I did not qualify for <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , simply because of academic deficiencies. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And the fact that I was Jewish and suffered from a lack of education was not taken into account. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And in 1947, the problem was asked, okay, what do I do now? </span><span class="sentence" id="85">The city of 20,000 people did not have many opportunities for young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">There were a couple openings in various trades. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">In the Czech economy at that time, usually somebody who selected a trade went into apprenticeship status for next three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So, there were openings if you wanted to become a barber or a painter or a sales clerk. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">All those trades are -- required three years apprenticeship. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But somehow it came to my attention that a <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span> was looking for apprenticeship connected with bort and learning classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So, the whole picture came -- began to look like a two year long apprenticeship, with half a day of practical work in a <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span> and half a day of classroom work. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I succeeded, with my father’s help, to enter the program and left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in which there was a <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I-It used to be owned by Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And I started as an apprentice in -- in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and I believe that the program was the first year. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">We were to rotate in the <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span> , from department to department and the second year you should have selected a department, which would become your specialty. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So I finished the first year, but even during the first year, I still had physical problems, because I was extremely weak as a result of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Furthermore, I never felt quite <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , because I was the only Jewish apprentice in our class of about 60. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So I was sort of a curiosity. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And I finished, I think, first half of the second year, when my parents suggested that -- by that time, it was 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">The Communists already took over the government of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> when my parents came to me with the question whether I would be willing to emigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Do you have any --
QUESTION:  Yes, that’s a good point to go back and -- and ask you questions about that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Did -- Did you feel, because you were behind in your schooling, did -- did that make you feel -- a-and your experience was different from others in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , I -- I assume, so wh -- did you feel alienated or -- or set apart from -- from your -- your classmates?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  I -- I do not think that I felt alienated from my classmates, maybe because all of them were on the nine year track, rather than on the 12 year track. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And simply, they were too young to have had first hand experience with the Nazis or Jews, because they grew up under normal conditions, with the exception of -- of -- of the war years. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span> , a great percentage of the students 1n the nine -- in -- in -- in the lower grades, commuted from neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And they were sons of farmers, who basically didn’t feel the war in the same fashion like people who were living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Because in the -- in the outlying areas, you know, the Nazis didn’t had such a tight control like over the population of -- of -- of larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Who were most of -- who were your friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Did you make close friend during that period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  I made some friends, simply because -- I got to tell you something, I was not tremendously interested in catching up with my academic deficiencies, simply because I didn’t had a -- a specific goal in mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">While I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span> , it never occurred to me, “Gosh, in -- in a year or two I will be finished, what do I do then?” </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It -- It never occurred to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I -- during the war, because of my being locked up always in -- in <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , I had tremendous energy, which first had to be satisfied. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And, as a result, I played soccer. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I was very good at soccer. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Although, because of my physical -- being physically weak, I didn’t -- I wasn’t able to run for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">But still, I was a very good soccer player in my own group of youngsters. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So, most of the time, I tried to catch up on the physical activities, which I missed during the war, rather than on the <span class="REGION">emotional side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">The physical deficiencies came to me more naturally than the academic development.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  What were some of the physical ailments? </span><span class="sentence" id="122">You said you were weak --
ANSWER:  I had, several times, very bad ear infection. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">You see, in those days, although penicillin was all ready -- after the war, was already invented, but it was question of availability. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So that was -- that was problem number one. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Then, when, during your formative years, you are continuously locked up, your body does not get the opportunity to develop physically. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And consequently, I -- I was weak, physically and undernourished. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So all that, first of all, I had to catch up with. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I don’t know what I ever caught up. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Basically, I will tell you something, I think that I caught up with most of the deficiencies, but I was always out of sync.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  Did you talk with your -- your mates and -- and your schoolmates and friends about your experience during the Holocaust -- during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Nobody was particularly interested in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">At one time one of my teachers suggested that I write a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">But, you know, coming to a 13 year old boy with a task, why don’t you write a book about your experiences, didn’t -- didn’t sit with me quite, quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I didn’t see any purpose for it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Because it’s -- it’s completely different than looking at it in hindsight, 50 years, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  You would think that s -- that some of your friends would -- would be curious or -- or perhaps you would be wanting to tell them because there was an adventure about -- I mean, there was partly an adventure. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I mean it ma-may not have felt that way to you, but if I were a classmate and I had a friend who’d -- who had done what you did during the war, I might be curious about hearing -- hearing about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  I don’t think -- I don’t think that the issue was ever -- ever raised. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">You know, okay, I’m -- I’m- you are right, had it happened now. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">But don’t forget, you have to project yourself to those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="142"><span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , for example, looking in hindsight, had only small number of newspapers that were all published in the capital city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I don’t remember ever seeing a local newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Television didn’t exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Radio -- those people who could afford a radio, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> had only two or three <span class="BUILDING">radio stations</span> which had three or four times a day news, the news were mostly of international nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So that news penetrated very, very slowly at -- int - to the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Usually news that was of local importance appeared on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulletin board</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> had, on -- in the major <span class="DLF">streets</span> , had big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulletin boards</span> , where some officials used to paste announcements. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">But otherwise, you simply didn’t know what is happening, unless you heard it over the radio, or if you knew a foreign language, to listen to Radio Vienna or -- or -- or some adjacent <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , listening to the news that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So that people didn’t know exactly, what was happening -- what happened in the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And I do not think that people were all that curious to find out somebody else’s experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Maybe -- Maybe -- Maybe people -- don’t forget that Christians in -- in those days, after the war, felt guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Because the Judaism in -- in -- in -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , the anti-Semitism was more of a religious character. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We Jews were not so much despised by the Czechs because we were wealthy or -- or -- or -- or more successful, but whenever the word Jew was thrown into my face, it was always labeled, you Christ killer. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So, you know -- and that was after the war against the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  So, saying that was against the law?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  Yes, against the Czech law, to point out that -- that expression. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">There was absolutely nothing forbidding to -- to be very antagonistic toward Gypsies, but the Jews were sheltered, as far as that goes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Did -- Did you experience any blatant anti-Semitism during those years that you were [indecipherable |
ANSWER:  After the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  After the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  To be very honest with you, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">If there was, it was well hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">It was not -- not -- not obvious to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Furthermore, I -- I think I was not even looking for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I have not -- not memory that I have experienced anything of that sort.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  Did you have Jewish friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span> had very, very small Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I -- I -- I think that there were about half a dozen Jewish families in -- in all of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">No, I don’t remember any -- I don’t remember nobody my own age bracket. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">There were a couple Jewish families, but these people very much older. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">They were more my parents age. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And then I was -- I had no particular reason to seek out Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I felt very comfortably with Christian friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  That’s a pretty difficult age, adol -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B
QUESTION:  That’s a pretty difficult age, adolescence, for anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Given that what you had gone through from ages, what, nine to 13? </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Was your adolescence -- do you remember it as being a happy time? </span><span class="sentence" id="177">A -- A difficult time? </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Or -- Or -- Or fairly normal?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  I -- I -- I don’t -- I cannot recall my feelings, but I didn’t see anything extremely difficult 1n it. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">It was more of a physical discomfort. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And simply I -- I think that we all were resigned to our fate. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I did not know of the alternatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Somehow it was made clear to me that complaining will not help, that we simply have to wait out end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And I recognized that fact and tried to make -- not fight it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  What was your relationship with your parents during the period from the end of the war to the time you went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  That was -- that was a little bit strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">My father and my mother had frequent fights, but I never knew exactly the nature of the fights, because they were all done in my absence. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">You know, children, if they’re left out -- whenever something very serious took place, the children were sent out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , or parents waited for the children, while they were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , to -- to settle their differences. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So there was a tension between my parents, but the tension was also caused, to a great deal, by my sister, who was no longer living with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">She was eight years older than I and she was trying to find her own way, recognizing that the c-city of Zenoimal d-does not have many opportunities to offer her. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Furthermore, she was already marriage age, so she was living in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and later on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Burno</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brinn</span> , working as a secretary -- steno for some <span class="BUILDING">firms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So there were also tensions caused because of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">But overall, the time after the war was not -- before I left for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , was not entirely smooth. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And only later, when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , I realized why. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">But by then, I was already thousands of miles away, not being in the position to influence the situation one way or the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  And what was it that you realized at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Now, I have to go a little bit back to talk about the last days prior to departure to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I do not know whether, in retrospect -- I have to mention that after leaving for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , I have never seen my parents again. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Consequently, I cannot ask them for details of those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">But, my father arranged for me to go to -- to emigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> with a group of youngsters my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I have met with part of that group. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Neither one of -- of the group was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span> , they all were dispersed throughout <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , but these individuals were already together a year or two in preparation for pioneering life in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So, I was attached to that group. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And that group belonged to a very left oriented political party. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">It was almost Communism. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">That -- the group had aimed to emigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and supplement membership of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> -- very left oriented kibbutz. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And I felt extremely uncomfortable after arriving in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , in that kibbutz type surrounding. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Because, I was exposed to the Communist propaganda in 1948 and I was able to realize that the Russians were extremely anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So, I began to realize that I fled Communism of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , just to come into a different form of Communism in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">But it -- it -- it was not initiated in my mind by -- so much by politics, but by various actions of that group, to which I supposedly had to conform to their way of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">For example, all the personal clothes -- clothing were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">They were all arranged in a group type -- <span class="BUILDING">communal type bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">You got clothing, two sets a week, depending on your size. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">You didn’t know whose clothing you are wearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Meals were given in a <span class="BUILDING">mess hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Every morning you have to look at your schedule where you were attached to work that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">So I became extremely bitter, fleeing from Communism in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , facing myself with Israeli Communism, although it was that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Furthermore, no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">We were -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> was quite a few miles from any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Everything you needed, you had to go to the group leader and ask for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Everything was allocated to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving cream, shaving blades, shoelaces, everything was rationed. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">You were permitted to write one letter a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">It was -- that group gave you the postage stamp. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">So it was extremely regimented type of life, which -- which didn’t sit with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">But I’m not quite certain, my father signed some documents, which legally obligated me to that group. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">But I think -- yes, I exited <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> on 10th of April, ‘49. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">It was a -- one of the last transports of Jews that was permitted to exit <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">There were about thousand of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">By <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> we rode from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">At that time was in existence, international refugee organization, was I think United Nations sponsored. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And we ended up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transition camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tranee</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , which is not far away from that <span class="DLF">port</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barre</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And there we waited for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to take us to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">We spent some two weeks in that camp because April ‘49 was Passover and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Israeli ship</span> didn’t wanted to sail during Passover holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">So when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> -- yes, I mentioned, we left 10th of April Prague, we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , 26th of April, ‘49 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">From there we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transition camp</span> , which again went against my grain because it had a <span class="DLF">fence</span> -- <span class="DLF">concertina fence</span> , with guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">We were sprayed heavily, DDT and each time you wanted to exit the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , you had to clear it with the guards at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And after several days in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came pick us -- pick -- pick us up and we were driven to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , where all these events took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , I think we worked about three days a week and two days a week we learned Hebrew and geography of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">That was still in ‘49 -- in April ‘49, when we arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">It was not quite a year since establishment of state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , which I think came into existence in my -- May of ‘48. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">But then, the war with Arab nations took place, so I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> just shortly after the cease fire with the Arab nations was signed. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">So there was still great deal of uncertainty whether it will not flair up once again. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Do you have any questions up to that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  No, you were leading up to the story about your parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  And that you’d found out that something about them --
ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">May I -- I will -- I will come to it little bit later?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">ANSWER:  But I would like to skip it for the time being. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">In -- I came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , I think, in about -- taking the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camp</span> into -- I think in May of ‘49, we finally came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And in November of *49, I quit. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I simply had -- I had enough of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I had some very distant relatives living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> , so with their permission, I got <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board in their <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And from November of *49, to July of ‘50, I lived with them and worked on various odd jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">In a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> for mirrors, in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> for -- that was making plastic buttons for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Until, in July of ‘50, I was drafted into the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I ended up with agricultural unit which had na -- an acronym, Nuchile, nor koletseem luchem, and went to basic training in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> for three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And after the basic training, we ended up -- again we were divided into groups and my group was put for a training of about six months in a different form of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moshaf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">There we were to learn that particular trade -- that <span class="DLF">agricultural line</span> and after the six months of training, we were to -- as a group of military personnel, we were to settle on the <span class="DLF">border</span> with <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> and build a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , an agricultural establishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">For that reason, we were discharged from uniform military, but had to stay for the duration of ma -- our military obligation in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , under paramilitary rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Leaving that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> prior to expiration of the military obligation would have meant that you would have been drafted and put back into uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">So, with various finagling, I was able to leave that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> temporarily, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was unable to support all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So some -- some of us had to go and seek outside employment. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And I found a job with a Israeli corporation that was laying a <span class="DLF">pipeline</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> to the <span class="DLF">Negev desert</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And part of my pay, I was sending to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , not so much to support them economically, but to show good faith that I still am in touch with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  And this -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  In <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> that was laying that <span class="DLF">pipeline</span> , was on the edge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">desert Negev</span> , about two hours by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> that I was obligated to, was on the border of <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , where this was deeper, in the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> -- it was a regular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> with the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> made of wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Every morning you exit to work on the <span class="DLF">pipeline</span> and in the evening you return. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">There was a <span class="INT_SPACE">mess hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">You were paid regularly -- a regular salary according to classification of your particular work. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And there I stayed for about a year, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">In the meantime -- now I began to realize what was happening back in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">A radio announced the trials took place -- I don’t know whether you are familiar with that, in -- in the 50’s, quite few ministers of the <span class="COUNTRY">Czech Republic</span> were sentence to be hanged. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">You know, these were out of made -- made up trials, accusing them of being spies for the US And Stalin was simply out of his mind by -- by -- the Communist regime was very, very tight in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Then one day, I received letter that my mother committed suicide, and now I have to go back again. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Some <span class="NPIP">place</span> and some times, during the war, when we were hiding in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , two fellows, young fellows, came to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and I don’t know until this day how did they found us, suggesting that we should return, that they actually will help us across the <span class="DLF">border</span> , back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Protecterat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Protecterat</span> , by that time, was cleared of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And if we will be in hiding in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Protecterat</span> , the Germans will have no reason to look for us, because all the Jews were already sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So I don’t know the fine points, where we were to hide on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , but they were guiding us from the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , across the <span class="DLF">border</span> , back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Protecterat</span> , when we were to rest in a <span class="BUILDING">tourist resort</span> , which was exactly on the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And as we approached the <span class="BUILDING">tourist resort</span> , subtly we heard barking of dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And that usually was a bad sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So these two guys told us to wait, that they will go and take a look why the dogs are barking and they simply never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So, we returned to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And now events took place as I said before, normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">We waited out the war without knowing what happened to these two guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">After the war, we were called as witnesses to <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">These two boys were supposedly caught in that <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> by the Germans and forced to collaborate. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I don’t know exactly what that meant -- these were young fellows, in -- in their early 20’s -- what was actually meant by collaborations, but in the early years, after the war, there were criminal cases by the hundreds, throughout the whole <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , against various collaborants with the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">That took place long before the Communists took over <span class="COUNTRY">Czech Republic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And we were called witn -- to be -- be witnesses on behalf of these two fellows. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And I do not remember exactly what sentence did these two boys got or whether they were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Unfortunately that did not end there. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">In 1948, while I was in the <span class="BUILDING">textile school</span> , I started having feeling that not everything is okay at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but I was unable to put my finger on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Namely, every month, I came for a <span class="BUILDING">weekend home</span> and my mother was always in tears and my father was furri -- furious. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And I didn’t know whether these were -- whether they had differences as man and wife or what -- what- what was nature of their conflict. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So, sometimes -- and I don’t know exactly what time period, was I able to begin to put things together. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I suspect that the first time I got some form of picture in 1965, when I visited <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> back for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">The following thing has developed. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">These two boys joined a -- became member of a club, American - Czechoslovak friendship. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And when Communists took over <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , they began to arrest all the members of this club. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And the two fellows approached my mother, because we lived so near <span class="DLF">Austrian border</span> , whether she can help them to escape to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And it was a whole group of Czech patriots in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span> , who were involved in helping to escape -- various people. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">There was custom officials involved in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Postal officials involved in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">They smuggled people on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> that went across the <span class="DLF">border</span> to de-de-deliver packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">So people were hiding behind the packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">But nevertheless, the Secret Police got wind of it and arrested the whole group of people, including my mother, and put them on trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And I still have at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , documents of the trial, the whole protocol. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I do not remember when -- how long the trial took place -- for how long, but my mother was freed, simply because she claimed that she wanted to -- to repay the boys their goodness that they helped us to -- tried to help us during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">She was freed. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">But the Secret Czech Police tried to convert my mother into a snitch to spy on others. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">My mother was imprisoned for about half a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And in 1952 or ‘53, out of desperation, she jumped out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And that -- what I got in a letter notice while I was in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , building the <span class="DLF">pipeline</span> , I got a letter from my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">So, as time went by, bits and piece of -- of the pieces began to -- to make sense what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And even though my parents send me to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , they promised that they will join me in the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And looking at it back now, I think there are two versions -- two possibilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">The Czech government began to realize that it is letting too many medical doctors out of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and they are weakening their own economy. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">So they stopped issuing emigration permits to medical doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">That is one possibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">The other possibility is that my mother was already heavily investigated by the secret police and they did not wanted to let my parents exit. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Which of the two forms is correct, I do not know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">QUESTION:  You’ve had to piece this story together yourself, really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">My sister didn’t wanted to help me much, because apparently it was too horrible for her to repeat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">But my sister was living nearby and she must have witnessed every step of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">QUESTION:  Did you have any contact with your father or did you speak with your father or -- or correspond after you --
ANSWER:  Just correspondence. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">But don’t forget that my father died in about 1962. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">My mother died in ‘53. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Their letters were heavily censored. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Every letter that left for <span class="REGION">western country</span> was very heavily censored, so that you were absolutely in no position to -- to get clear answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">QUESTION:  Wh-What is the effect of the news of your mother’s suicide on you, in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">ANSWER:  It was devastating, it was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">For short while I started blaming my father, not knowing the details. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I thought that she committed suicide because of some -- some family disputes. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So I had ab -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A
QUESTION:  Wh- What is the effect of the news of your mother’s suicide on you, in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  It was devastating, it was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">For short while I started blaming my father, not knowing the details. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I thought that she committed suicide because of some -- some family disputes. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">So I had absolutely no evidence as to the true nature of what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">So, for long time, I was angry at my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">But slowly, slowly, the picture began to clear itself up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">QUESTION:  I -- I read, I believe, the transcripts of your video interview, that -- that you believed the -- the rape of your mother during hiding had something to do with -- might have had something to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Is that -- 1s that not correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">ANSWER:  I -- I don’t think that that -- because that -- her -- her suicide took place nine years later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">There -- there was a trial -- the men who raped your mother were put on trial, is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">ANSWER:  Not the man himself, but the commandant of that unit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">QUESTION:  And were you present for that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  No, no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Apparently, there was enough -- the evidence -- and I came across his name not long ago, here, in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">That -- that trial had such heavy evidence against him for so many other things, that this was not needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Although it would have been pleasure, maybe, to be present at the trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">QUESTION:  Where was the trial, and what year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">ANSWER:  The trial was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">He was Slovak. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">The trial, I think, was in 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Again, it was one of hundreds and hundreds of trials.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">QUESTION:  And what became of this man?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">ANSWER:  I think that he got the rope. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">So, you know, being very cynical, everybody can die only once. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So -- but I -- I know I was shaken up by my mother’s suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">But, then the trials were taking place, you know, for the government in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and friend of mine who -- with whom I was sharing <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , Puther Margolias, his uncle was -- also got the rope. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">So we shared our misfortune with each other.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  Is that later in the story, when you returned, or is this during?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  No, no, it just about a year ago, I wrote about -- and it came in a very interesting fashion, back. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">I wrote about my experiences in a magazine called Phoenix, which was dealing with these issues and apparently somebody has read my story and he and his wife went for a visit to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and spent part of their time to retracing my experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And they also published their experiences in the same magazine. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">When I came, in ‘65, to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> back, for the first time, I was told by my sister -- I asked about that minister, and my sister was not quite sure what has happened to him, except knowing that he has spent some time in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">But, my first visit in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was only two weeks long and I simply did not have enough time, nor I didn’t know just what can I do under the Communist regime and what can I not? </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Because I came from <span class="COUNTRY">US</span> , which was their biggest enemy and every time you went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , you had to report with the <span class="BUILDING">local police station</span> , who registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And when you exited, you had again to let them know that you are leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">So, I didn’t know exactly what -- what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">But this fellow wrote up that the minister was imprisoned by the Communists and freed eventually, after several years, but in such a poor health, that not long thereafter, he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And I have that article with -- even with his photo, of that minister. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">You see, there were couple Christians, during our experiences, who actually practiced Christianity. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Who didn’t just go Sundays to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , who actually practiced Christianity. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">But there were very few and far in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And the minister was one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">QUESTION:  Do you know what became of some of the farmers that helped you out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">ANSWER:  One of them was executed with his whole family, for hiding us. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">That was after we were caught, because we didn’t report, like we promised, so he was executed with his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Another farmer, his son was a schoolteacher, who actually supplied me with a false school certificate, giving me an assumed name and assume identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">He was caught by helping partisans, and executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">So, his father’s lost two sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Some of them simply died natural death.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  Were you close to those families -- those farm families?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="406">QUESTION:  Sort of like aunts and uncles, or --
ANSWER:  Well, they were very close to us, because most of them -- not all of them, but most of them did it in gratitude towards my grandfather, because he was their medical doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">He was responsible for their well beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">QUESTION:  What -- What happened to your grandparents after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">ANSWER:  We are talking about my maternal grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Well, my -- my paternal grandparents -- my grandmother and my aunt went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and perished there. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And my maternal grandparents that were with us all the time, returned after the war to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> and simply died of old age.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">QUESTION:  What was your relationship with them? </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Did you stay in touch?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">ANSWER:  Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">That was a very close relationship, very close relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Because it was our grandfather who actually -- due to his profession and due to his contacts, saved our lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  So you visited with them and spent some time with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">QUESTION:  Did you communicate with -- with them and -- when you had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">ANSWER:  In -- Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">But again, the letters were in a -- in a sort of a cryptic form, not very clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">You had always to read between <span class="DLF">lines</span> and fictitious names and symbols.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">QUESTION:  When did you find out about your -- your father’s parents, that they had died in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">ANSWER:  Well, my grandparents -- my grandfather from my father’s side, died in 1923. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">That was long before Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I do not know the circumstances of his death. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">My grandmother and aunt, they simply have not returned to co -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I do not know exactly in what form the Czech provisional government notified the relatives of those people who failed to return. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I don’t know in what form they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">But, you assumed that after the war has ended, if you were not contacted within some sensible period of time, that the person simply has died. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">So I think that it became very -- then, it also became clear to us that my grandmother, when -- when she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> was already some 75.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Do you know which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> she was sent to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">ANSWER:  Yes, and if -- if you wish, we can look it up in the Theresien book -- in that memorial book. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">She and her daughter, my aunt, first went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> and then they continued from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">But, the fact that somebody was shipped from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> in a transport to a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> that does not mean that that person has actually died in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="437">That person may have died while he was transported to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And that, nobody will ever be able to establish the fact that certain people have died already, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Those that went to <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , okay, they’re registered in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> going to <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">But those that died on the <span class="DLF">road</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , that would never be, probably, established, where exactly, they died.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">QUESTION:  I wanted to go back to y-your father’s decision to have you go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> [indecipherable |
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">QUESTION:  What was the -- the motivation? </span><span class="sentence" id="443">What was his reason?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">ANSWER:  I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">My father, in all likelihood, felt very uncomfortably with the approaching Communist regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And it didn’t take him too long to convince me to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">He sweeten it up by the fact that they will -- he and mother will join me and we’|I start life in a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Then, I began to feel pressure in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where I was apprentice, in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , began to feel pressure, Communist pressure to conform. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">I already began to feel it, even before I left for that <span class="BUILDING">trade school</span> , in my soccer club. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">My soccer team was suddenly required to come to a <span class="BUILDING">Communist school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I don’t know how -- how -- they used to call it <span class="BUILDING">agitation center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="452">It was sort of a <span class="BUILDING">cultural center</span> , in which the Communist events took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">So we were -- if you want to play soccer next Sunday, you have to come Tuesday, wearing a white shirt and a red scarf, to that <span class="BUILDING">Communist cultural center</span> and start singing various songs glorifying the labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">If you will not come, you will not play soccer game next Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">So that all started to go against my grain. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I don’t think it was with a full understanding what Communism 1s, but all that order giving process began to remind me so much of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Didn’t the Nazis did exactly the same thing to me? </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Telling me what <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> can I visit, what <span class="DLF">streets</span> can I go to and what am I permitted to do and what not permitted to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So that began to ring in my -- hey, we are going into another- another -- another commini -- another Nazi era. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">But instead of swastikas, this one has a -- has a hammer and sickle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">QUESTION:  Well, then you faced the conformity in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">ANSWER:  And then I began to face the same thing again, in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was starting to take place. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">So all of that rang bell, back to the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And the Communism, whether yo-you are being taught by a Jew or by a Christian, doesn’t make any difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">It’s the same lady in a different dress.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">QUESTION:  What was the name of that left leaning group that -- that you went with to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  It was a political party called Ma Pum. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I do not believe that it exists any more, it simply changed it’s name today. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">But it was not Vanegorian, nor Golda Meir. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">It was Ma Pum. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">It was a very leftist, Zionistic, Communist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Marx, Lenin, all nine yards involved, only having a Jewish flavor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">QUESTION:  I read somewhere that where you said you were lonely in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  That -- That -- because I didn’t fit that particular group, I was ostracized. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I felt very lonely, at least in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Then, in July of ‘50, when I joined the military, the army, at least in the basic training, I f -- began to feel very comfortably. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Because these were all fellows my age and the Israeli military, at least in the basic training, in my days, gave me the same feeling like a US soldier must have when he joins the Marine Corps, that you have a family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  And did you feel loyalty toward <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Or patriotism toward <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in -- in being in the army?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">ANSWER:  I do not think that it came so much -- that it was so much question of patriotism toward <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , because I still kept hoping that my parents will come. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">But as -- when my mother committed suicide, it became quite clear to me that my father will never leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I started losing -- I don’t think that I had Zionistic enthusiasm. </span><span class="sentence" id="483"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , for me, didn’t mean much, because I simply didn’t had the upbringing or the contacts with that affili -- that kind affiliation. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I started looking toward <span class="COUNTRY">US</span> because I had here an uncle, my father’s brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">QUESTION:  When did you begin to think about <span class="COUNTRY">US</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">ANSWER:  To be honest with you, I already started thinking about it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , while we were sailing from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I already approad the captain of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , asking him how do I emigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and I remember that shocking expression on his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Here he is, responsible for some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> of 1500 immigrants and people are already asking him how to exit <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So he told me, “Young man, you will have to give first <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> lots of sweat and blood before you will be able to exit <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="490">But that was my first thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">What, if ever, things will not work out? </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Because I -- I wanted very badly, family. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And I didn’t had in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , nobody truly close. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">They -- the closest was in <span class="COUNTRY">US</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">QUESTION:  That’s -- it’s interesting that you would feel lonely, you know, obviously you were missing your parents, but there were so many other survivors in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , that one would think that there might be some common bond. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">But did -- did you feel that, or did -- and did you talk about your experience much while you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">ANSWER:  No, no, no, no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">You see, this is -- although it is a very logical assumption, but it’s completely false. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Number one -- it’s false for two reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Number one, in the first years after liberation, if you will, everybody tried to forget the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">That has not changed, even with people’s arrival to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">You see, everybody has a different time limit for forgetting. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Some forget quickly, some forget never. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">But, people were not very open and willing to talk about their individual experiences during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Secondly, everybody who came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , with the exception of those that ended up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , had to start finding their own living -- making their own living. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And that began to -- to take majority of their time and occupation, to -- to try to si -- find some economic way of supporting themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So that -- that was reason number two. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">These were the two most important reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And reason number three, that although majority of the Jews of those days that came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> were survivors of the Holocaust, but they came from different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">So, consequently they did not had much in common, culturally, except, you know -- I don’t know, it -- it -- 1t 1s still -- it still puzzles me even today, you know, the only thing that we do have in common, maybe, is the Bible. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">But once everybody grows up in -- in different <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , under different circumstances, the only thing that we have in common are that we are all human beings, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="512">The culture affinity isn’t there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">QUESTION:  You said in your video interview, one of the reasons why I never liked <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> is because I always felt that the wound of the Holocaust will never heal --
ANSWER:  Oh yes, oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">QUESTION:  -- 1f you will continuously --
ANSWER:  Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">QUESTION:  -- remind -- be reminded of it every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">You know, the Israeli government tried to -- to establish a bond between the newcomers and the oldtimes and the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and they did so -- one of their very may -- met -- maybe effective weapons was continuously try to remind us that it was <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> who accepted us after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Because the Communists wouldn’t let you to emigrate anyplace else, except to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And the Israeli government also, in -- in their propaganda, was preaching that in -- in -- in unity is -- is strength and in division is weakness. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">So, you know, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I -- I -- ’'m not easily -- I was never easily influenced by -- by that kind of propaganda, because I have experienced it many times before. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Maybe I’m -- even today, it takes me awhile to sort things out, but eventually I think I -- I see the light.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">QUESTION:  The -- The comment about -- your comment about the wound of the Holocaust will never heal if you continuously reminded of it, is sort of in contrast to the other -- th-the famous -- I guess maybe it’s Elie Wiesel, you know, where we’re doomed to repeat if we -- if we don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">D-Do you see those two in -- in contrast, or are you talking about what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , with -- with the Israeli government constantly reminding you as a way of bonding you together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">ANSWER:  No, you see, the difference probably, without having been able to analyze it from that angle, I think the basic difference between my bitterness or -- or scars of the Holocaust and Elie W- Wiesel or Wiesel’s is a difference 1-in our ages. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">You know, I -- I -- I don’t know exactly how old Elie is, whether he is my age or he’s older, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">But then, the Holocaust itself does -- didn’t affect everybody equally. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">It -- It depends on your emotional make-up. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">So that for me, at least, I -- I fear and I am playing back, you know, sometimes in my mind, I am going -- I am doing like the Monday morning quarterback talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Undoubtedly, had my mother not being involved in that affair, had <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> not been raped by the Nazis, then <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> -- had not been for the Nazis, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> would not have been Communist in ‘48, I would have had probably a normal childhood, like thousands and thousands of people in -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">US</span> have, who grow up normal lives, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Even here, no -- not -- not everybody is liked by everybody, for whatever reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">But if you -- you -- you have freedom to -- to move, you have freedom to -- to select, to do whatever you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">But the Holocaust put on me a label. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I still feel the yellow star here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">QUESTION:  A-And what goes along with that feeling?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">ANSWER:  Feelings of inferiority. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Feelings of second class citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Suspicion. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B [blank] Beginning Tape Three, Side A
QUESTION:  -- feeling?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">ANSWER:  Feelings of inferiority. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Feelings of second class citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Suspicion... These probably are the first things that come to my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Certain amount of bitterness, specially of having lost time. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Because, as I told you initially, I continuously feel I’m out of sync. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Iam about 15 to 20 years behind in experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I’m certainly not fully acclimatized. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Language problems, cultural barriers, if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I don’t feel comfortably in large groups of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So, you know, these are some of -- some of the residues. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">But again, as I told you, I don’t know exactly to what degree they are a product of the Holocaust.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="556">QUESTION:  Do you spend much time thinking about that, or -- or not?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  Well, I joined the federal government in 1972 and I began to feel the Affirmative Action for the first time in 1974 or 1975. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">It may have been called differently in those days, but so many slots have to be allotted to women, so many to minorities, people with Hispanic names. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">You know, it again started labeling people who have priority over you, to whom you have to sacrifice your progress, because they are disadvantaged. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">But then I began to ask myself, “Gosh, why are they disadvantaged?” </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I came here with 10 dollars in my pocket, waiting five years for emigration visa to the <span class="COUNTRY">US</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I started in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> as a shipping clerk. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And I started going to <span class="BUILDING">night school</span> , first in preparation for GED high school equivalency test, then after passing that, I was going to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> at night, paying for it through my own pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">So I was begging to ask, ““Why are those people given all the privileges, where I was not given it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I never asked for it, didn’t wanted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">It’s a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , you can do whatever you want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">So, I again begin to feel I am cheated by something. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I had to work and pay for it and they get it free of charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">On the contrary, they are encouraged to come forward and raise a hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And I -- I -- I know it’s very unfair to make that comparison, but that’s exactly how I felt.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="591">QUESTION:  And what kind was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">ANSWER:  This was probably the economic anti-Semitism, connected with envy. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">That you Jews are born smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">You Jews own all the <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">You Jews have formed some con-conspiratory groups to wipe us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And in addition to anti-Semitism, it was also intensified by being white. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">The fact that I have tried to -- to explain to -- to -- to these people that there are many black Jews, too, who eventually feel exactly like the blacks feel here. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">The black Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> are also extremely unhappy with their lot.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="609">QUESTION:  Did you say you were forced to resign?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">ANSWER:  Well, I was forced to resign as a civil service, but that may have been -- may have been an anti-Semitic -- may have had a reason, anti-Semitic, but I am not hundred percent sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Can we take a short break?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="621">QUESTION:  And what was the effect of that message upon you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">ANSWER:  Frankly speaking, I said baloney. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I always felt very comfortably living side by side with people of all religion and all national origins. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And I didn’t see any reason for living in a pure or elistic type society.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="628">ANSWER:  I do not think that it happened -- the decision probably started already in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , because I do not believe that my parents truly planned to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Later on, it -- it -- 1t turned that that was the only way out, but the original plan was to join my uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and my father already, in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , started learning English and prepare himself for US dental examination for foreign doctors, which he knew that he will eventually have to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">So that the seeds were already planted in my mind in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and I started putting them into action in about 1952, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Not knowingly. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I was still in the Israeli military. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I walked to the emba -- <span class="BUILDING">American embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> and they asked me several questions and when they discovered that I’m still under military obligation, they told me that they cannot even register me until I am discharged from the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And about 1953, I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I was already di-discharged. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">They said they cannot register me once again, because <span class="COUNTRY">US</span> has closed emigration quota for <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , because <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> supplies arms to <span class="COUNTRY">North Korea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And, as you know, at least in those days, emigration quota to <span class="COUNTRY">US</span> was determined by the country of your birth, not of your si -- current -- present situ -- citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And Czechoslovak quota was very small, furthermore, it was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Furthermore, I had no right to any preferential quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">So that I would be asked, if I still was interested, to come back once the closure is lifted. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">So I came back in ‘54, when finally I was able to register under a non-preferential quota and it took five years before finally I was called to submit my documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">By that time I have discovered that I don’t have a birth certificate, so I have to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Czech embassy</span> to apply for birth certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Then, I didn’t know I had to submit an affidavit of support, which I had to obtain from somebody in the <span class="COUNTRY">US</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">So I had to write to my relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and my grandfather was able to broker -- can you visualize Communist censored letters from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">US</span> , trying to broker for me a affidavit of support to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">US</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="645">It was very, very delicate operation and through some very distant relatives whom I -- until that point, never met, sent me an affidavit of support and lend me money for passage, because my savings went all for preparation of the papers, because everything had to be translated from Czech to English and from Hebrew into English and the Israelis had to pay some taxes, because -- which I -- I’m not so certain that you know of that fact, that when you emigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , the Israeli government, at it’s own expense, puts you through a language course and puts you through that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">But, for all that the Israeli government pays, from the donation of the American government, the dollars and the Jews that donate money to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">So, a certain fixed amount of money is granted for absorption of a single person or a family and so forth and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And that is a open debt which you have. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">As long as you are staying in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , the debt is never called, but once you want to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , they send you a bill for all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">So I had to pay it back.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="669">ANSWER:  I think that I came close to it several times, but none never -- never anything developed to -- to a serious stage. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">There was -- there was, again, the differences in cultural background, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="671">The fact that two people are Jewish doesn’t -- doesn’t make them automatically see eye to eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">There are that -- the s -- very same differences, like between here, a man and woman, you know, they are no different. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Then <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , in those days, had economic -- tremendous economic difficulties. </span><span class="sentence" id="674"><span class="BUILDING">Apartments</span> were in very short supply. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">In those days it was almost impossible to rent an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="676">You had either to buy it, like you buy a co-op here, or a <span class="BUILDING">condominium</span> , or you have to put key money. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I don’t know whether you are ever -- you know, familiar with that concept of key money. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Let’s say you are renting an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">You have to put -- just as an example -- 10,000 dollars as a deposit to the landlord and you pay him a month, 10 dollar rent. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">The next year, your deposit goes down to -- from 10,000 to 9,000 and your rent goes up to 20 dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">The third year your key deposit goes down to 800 dollars and you have to pay him 30 dollars a month in rent. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">When it reaches zero, can you see the see saw? </span><span class="sentence" id="683">When it reaches zero, you have to start from the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And simply, very few people have the money to put for the key deposit, so that many couples cannot get married.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="686">QUESTION:  -- the papers to come through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">ANSWER:  Yes, that was -- that was not so difficult from economic point of view, because taxi drivers, you know, were able to make ends meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">But the problem was that when there came something as more serious decision to be made, a long term commitment, I did not know which way to go, because I have -- had -- had no assurance that I will ever receive visa to <span class="COUNTRY">US</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And even if -- if I did, I never knew when it will come. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">It was continuously disrupted by my being recalled to reserve duty, to the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">By that time, I had already the rank of corporal in the Israeli army and the higher your rank is, the longer period you serve in the reserve obligations. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And they slice your obligation into segments, it’s not one unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">It’s a week here, two weeks here. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And the Israeli economy in those days, even when you worked, they did not reimburse you with salary to -- to the time you had to serve in the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And you got military pay according to your rank and that was peanuts, because the Israeli military claimed that they are feeding you, they are dressing you, so they give you only couple dollars monthly spending money -- pocket money for cigarettes and razor blades. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And in the meantime, if you rented someplace a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , you still had to pay rent for the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> after you exit the reserve obligation.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="700">ANSWER:  Okay, the trip -- the trip itself, I don’t know why I felt very ambivalent because I knew what I am leaving behind, but I didn’t know what I went facing. </span><span class="sentence" id="701"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , in those days -- <span class="BUILDING">Lute Airport</span> didn’t accommodate <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">I flew out with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Super Constellation</span> , four engine prop airplane from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lute</span> , which is not far away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Our first stop was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I flew with Air France. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , I stayed about two or three hours and boarded another Super Constellation to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> already accommodated <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jets</span> , so there were about four passengers on the whole Air France jet prop plane to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">By the way, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jet planes</span> fair was more expensive than the prop. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">So I slept almost all -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , it took about 12 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Stretched myself across all those three or four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> and slept most of the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Arriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , it was not <span class="BUILDING">Kennedy Airport</span> , but 1t was <span class="BUILDING">Idlewild Airport</span> in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">I arrived, I think about 4:30 in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">The immigration officer was already sleeping behind his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="713">I think I was the only immigrant. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">The <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> was deserted. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">He looked at my papers and say, “You just made it in time.” </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I came three days before my entry visa was to expire. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And there were waiting some very distant relatives, for me, at <span class="BUILDING">Idlewild Airport</span> , who took me to their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="718">I slept there, I think, for about 10 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">First time that I was able to eat a decent European type meal and have apples. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">You know <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> is very, very short on apples, because of the climate. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And I went to visit my uncle and aunt, from whom I had a letter waiting for me at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , to come to visit them. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Do we have any <span class="DLF">gaps</span> to close?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="910">ANSWER:  First of all, it took me quite a -- quite a bit of time to decide what is it I want to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">I didn’t wanted to study accounting to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">I wanted to become a chemical engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">But my background in -- in math was not sufficiently strong to gain admission to <span class="BUILDING">engineering school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="914">Then, <span class="BUILDING">engineering school</span> was five years long, instead of four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">That would have created another problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Then, I felt that to study something other than accounting would require a much better knowledge of the English language than I possessed .Then the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , even though it was a <span class="BUILDING">private university</span> , regulated to some degree, the sequence of the courses I was taking -- I had to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">Because everybody who was admitted under GED had first to take English, History, Math and Language, before taking anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">The 15 -- the first 18 or 24 credits, you were simply on probation. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">So I -- I felt like walking continuously on a thin ice. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And then American girls had tremendous influence on my way of thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">Because I heard, in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> -- you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> is a haven for Jewish American women. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And I don’t mean it as a joke. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">You would be surprised how many American Jewish women come to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to find a husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And some of them are extremely wealthy and some of them are really willing to compromise and go down very low on the economical le -- <span class="DLF">ladder</span> to find a Jewish husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Many marriages end up in a disaster. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Very few American Jewish girls stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="927">They usually bring their husbands to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="928">And many of the Jewish boys simply don’t measure up to the expectations. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">But, in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , in my days, there was generated the saying that American girls have tremendous body, but instead of a heart, they had a computer. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And that was confirmed to me when I was dating American Jewish girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">I -- for first 10 years, I dated only -- tried to date only Jewish American girls and it was always the same result. “</span><span class="sentence" id="932">You are a nice boy, but you are nothing economically.” </span><span class="sentence" id="933">The girls told me, “We are seeking somebody who has it made already.” </span><span class="sentence" id="934">Again, I was out of sync. “</span><span class="sentence" id="935">Yes, you have perseverance. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">We see that you are going nights to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you are trying to better yourself.” </span><span class="sentence" id="937">But I got my BS, I was 37. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">By that time, most fellows already are partners in some business or self-employed or whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="939">QUESTION:  When did you meet your wife?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="940">ANSWER:  Huh, that is a very interesting story. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">I worked at <span class="BUILDING">Allied Chemicals</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morrisstown</span> and I was renting a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">He was also from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and she was from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="943">They were Christians, but they were honest, good family. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And one day, in 1968, his uncle from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> came to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Because in ‘68, if you remember th-the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> ’s sprink liberated the <span class="DLF">exit</span> and he succeeded coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">US</span> for a visit, leaving his wife and children as hostages that he will come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And we started talking and he said, “Look, you will have absolutely no problems --” he asked me why I’m still single, so I describe him the situation and he said, “Look, that doesn’t surprise me. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">You simply don’t fit, culturally with American girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">You would be much better off finding a Czech girl.” </span><span class="sentence" id="949">So I said, “Well, how that would be possible after so many years not being there? </span><span class="sentence" id="950">A whole generation or two were born.” </span><span class="sentence" id="951">So he said, “Leave it to me, I will look around.” </span><span class="sentence" id="952">And he lined up about five or six girls and I came for a visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">I went out with all of them and I selected one. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And in 1970, I went once or twice again to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and I established correspondence with one of the girls and it clicked without any problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And in 1970, I was about to graduate in August and in June of 1970, I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and got married there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="956">QUESTION:  So, these Czech women, were they in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="958">QUESTION:  How -- How were you dating them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="959">ANSWER:  I stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> for a month and I went out with each one of them and I finally decided on one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="960">QUESTION:  And this was set up by you --

<p><span class="sentence" id="961">QUESTION:  And had you corresponded with them, at any point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="962">ANSWER:  With two I kept correspondence until I severed the correspondence and I began to concentrate on that one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="963">QUESTION:  And why was it that you selected yo-your -- your future wife? </span><span class="sentence" id="964">What was it about her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="965">ANSWER:  Chemistry. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">The Czechs gave me bloody hard time to get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">You cannot visualize how many documents I needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="968">QUESTION:  How soon after you -- you met, were you married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="969">ANSWER:  About two years later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">QUESTION:  So she came back to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">We were -- we were married in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , it took her three months to process the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">But the three months were delayed by US, not by the Czechs. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">We started processing our papers for the marriage about year earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">That has to be satisfied the Czech government first.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="980">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">Did you talk with her about your Holocaust experiences? </span><span class="sentence" id="982">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A
QUESTION:  -- your Holocaust experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="983">ANSWER:  I think I did, but she is much younger than I. She is 16 years younger than I, so she did not have first hand experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">Furthermore, she was born already under the Communist regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">But she had couple girlfriends who were Jewish, who were -- I -- I don’t know whether the girls or their parents were product of the Holocaust, so she knew what I am talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="986">QUESTION:  Had you talked about your Holocaust experience with -- with very many people in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="987">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">Not -- not -- not -- not many, not many. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">In all honesty, I think that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morrisstown</span> , where I spent 10 years, I didn’t speak about it once. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">I belonged, because of my Morrisstown uncle, in a Jewish congregation, a very modern congregation, sort of a religious how they call it, Reform Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">But not one of the Jews there ever, ever asked me about Holocaust experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">I do not know just what -- what it is about -- the American Jews, they are a completely different breed. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">You know, the -- sometimes you are wondering what sort of a Jews are they to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">For example, when -- when -- when there were wars of -- I used to teach the Hebrew language in that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> to kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">So there was a war, I don’t know, in ‘67, between <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and Arabs, and one of the boys came to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> after the war has ended and said, “Mr. Deutsch, isn’t it fantastic we beat the Arabs?” </span><span class="sentence" id="996">They are riding on the coattails of the <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> when <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> does something great. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">But they don’t want to recognize <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> when things are not going so well, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="998">So I- I don’t think that the American Jews know exactly where and how do they fit, whether they are American or they should be Israelis. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">Then they don’t know exactly how the Judaism fits into the Israeli structure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">They are very confuse and very ambivalent about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1001">QUESTION:  And how do you see yourself fitting in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1002">ANSWER:  For me, Judaism is a religion and nothing more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> is a society composed of Jews, but that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">And the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> go to various <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> , to Orthodox, to Reform. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And as far as beyond that, they have absolutely nothing in common. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">What is united -- uniting -- uniting them is the danger from the Arabs on one hand and the bad memories of anti-Semitism and Holocaust from Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And not having -- not being for the Holocaust, I’m not certain that <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> as state would exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">It still would be probably today, <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1009">QUESTION:  Was your marriage ceremony performed by a rabbi?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1010">ANSWER:  No, no, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> -- we got married in 1970, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> did not have religious ceremonies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">It was conducted by a judge -- peace judge, how you want to call him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1012">QUESTION:  Justice of the Peace?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1013">ANSWER:  Justice of the Peace, and my marriage -- I have a rec-recording of it, of the whole ceremony.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1014">QUESTION:  Oh, a tape recording?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1019">QUESTION:  So when did you come back to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> with your wife?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1020">ANSWER:  Okay, I came back -- we got married in June of ‘70, I came back -- I worked already in <span class="BUILDING">Mount Sinai Hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">It was couple months before graduation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">They gave me already a professional status as an accountant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">I came back probably end of June and October 10th, my wife came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">We rented an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morrisstown</span> and I think in January of 1971 -- she was a medical technician, she found a job also at <span class="BUILDING">Mount Sinai</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and started working as a medical technician there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1025">QUESTION:  And -- And your job was an accountant at <span class="BUILDING">Mount Sinai</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1033">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1034">QUESTION:  And so, what was that time like? </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">Your -- Your wife is -- her first experience in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and -
ANSWER:  Well, the first experience was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">I -- I -- I -- I was desperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">She started crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">She cried for about a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">I do not know whether she started -- yeah, she was hired at <span class="BUILDING">Mount Sinai</span> , but <span class="BUILDING">Mount Sinai</span> had a strange employment structure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">It is very heavily unionized and there are various categories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">There are union for nurses, union for blue collar workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">Everybody’s unionized and everybody belongs to a different union, and every union has a different pay scale. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">And my wife belonged to union of medical technicians, and the union of medical technicians has a -- has the lowest pay scale than the union of blue collar workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">And she, coming from a Communist <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , was extremely insulted that she, with all her medical training, is getting paid less than the janitor is paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">And that was insulting to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">But, looking at it in retrospect, I think -- and I will of course never, never ask her about it, that she gave me that as an excuse, but I think that she was very, very homesick and tried to cover up for it by giving me that excuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">In 1971, about year after she came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , she went already for a visit to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , to visit her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">And she tells me -- she was there about a month, that she had -- have -- had to think about it very deeply whether she wants to come back to <span class="COUNTRY">US</span> or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">But, apparently, I don’t know whether she made the decision on her own or whether her mother talked her into it, she came back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1050">QUESTION:  That must have been frightening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1051">ANSWER:  Yes, yes it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">But -- well, I -- I -- I don’t know what to tell you about it today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">I don’t know how my thoughts -- in what direction they went in those days, whether she will come back or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1054">QUESTION:  Do you have children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1055">ANSWER:  Yes, we have a son. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">Was born in 1975.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1057">QUESTION:  Oh, that’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">I spoke with him on the phone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1059">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, you talked to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">Well, all those years, we both worked, we saved money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">So he finished -- he got his BS from <span class="BUILDING">Virginia Tech</span> , in economics and his MBA from Texas A and M, which he finished about five months ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">And three months ago he s-started to work for a consulting firm in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Springfield</span> , <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">And he’s traveling as a consultant for that firm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1064">QUESTION:  And what is it -- what is his name?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1066">QUESTION:  Leon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">After your uncle?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1068">ANSWER:  After my uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morrisstown</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1069">QUESTION:  Do y -- Have you talked about your Holocaust experience with him much?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1070">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">He’s very interested in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">He visited the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> here once or twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">He’s half Jewish and I think that he leans much more toward Judaism than toward Christianity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">I explained to him several times the liabilities of -- and the assets of both and told him, “Look, you are in a position to choose.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">And for some reason, I -- I cannot put my finger on it, but he feels closer affinity to Judaism than to Christianity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">My wife stays out of it, she couldn’t care less for neither one, although she feels also s-sympathy toward Christia -- toward Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">But she’s not trying to influence our son one way or the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1078">QUESTION:  Do you remember the first time you told him about what you went through as a child during the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1079">ANSWER:  I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">I do not know one -- when I told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">He asked me, for example, why did we named him Leon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">So when I started telling him that he was named after Uncle Leon, he started asking about Uncle Leon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And I think that’s how it led towards -- towards the Holocaust issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">Then, when I -- after I moved from mo -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morrisstown</span> , I kept meeting with my New York uncle about once a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">He was extremely angry at me that I deserted him and decided to break bread with his brother, whom he never forgave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">And my uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> continuously kept criticizing everything I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">He used always negative criticism. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">H-He always told me, “Don’t do that,” but he never told me what to do instead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">And I raised couple times the issue, “What would you say if I married a Christian girl?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">So he was very much against it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">So when I did marry my wife, I simply didn’t tell him that I’m going to marry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">I came back and on nec -- our next meeting, I told him, “Uncle, I just came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and I married a Christian girl.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">And that was the end for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">We had a fight and we never saw each other again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">That was in 1970. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">And in 1973, he died, natural death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">He got a heart attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">But there comes a related and also interesting story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">He had a daughter, a ravishing beauty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">She was about 18 or 19, right out of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , when she married her sweetheart, graduate of Columbia, engineer, who worked for Sperry Gyroscope in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , on Long Island. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">An extremely well paying job, very bright, good looking fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">They lived on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Long Island</span> and I saw her twice in 1959. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">And I was unable to see her again and I had the feeling that, at that time, that because I didn’t lived up to my aunt’s and uncle’s expectations, that they ins-instigated her against me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">And about year or two later, in early 60’s, he quit his job with Sperry Gyroscope and moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Palo Alto</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> , got a very high position with one of the <span class="BUILDING">electronics firms</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Palo Alto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">And my uncle never wanted to give me their address. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">So, I lost complete contact with them and when my uncle died, in ‘73, I was trying to find out their address. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">But my aunt, the one who hated me, was still alive and she didn’t wanted to speak to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">And I didn’t know how to find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">I looked telephone books, looked every <span class="NPIP">place</span> , I was unable to find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">And about two years ago, don’t ask me how and why, I exhausted all the <span class="DLF">avenues</span> of finding her and suddenly something occurred to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">I wrote to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , asking for my uncle’s death certificate and they answered me that I have insufficient information, that maybe he died outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and in which case they will not have his death records. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And about at that time, I bought an internet and I went through the Social Security -- some organization publishes death registry by states and Social

<p><span class="sentence" id="1147">ANSWER:  I -- I don’t know -- because by wanting his death certificate, I didn’t know what the end result will be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">I have just tried to get together pieces to a jigsaw puzzle, who died and when. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">And maybe my son is trying and has been building our family tree.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1151">ANSWER:  And I think for that reason, I tried to get together as many pieces as I possibly can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And maybe that has led me to the original. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">Because there were four brothers, I did not know exactly, chronologically, how they fit, who is the oldest, who is the youngest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">And, being an accountant, I like things in order. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">So maybe -- maybe that --

</span><span class="sentence" id="1209">Simply by joining US government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">So that led me to decision to join the US government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">And originally I applied for a slot with the IRS, but from OPN in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> -- Office of Personnel Management, my rating was too high for the IRS starting position. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">And apparently, the Department of Defense had many more vacancies in that grate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">So I was picked up by the US Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">And instead of commuting 55 miles to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , I was commuting now seven miles to <span class="BUILDING">Picatinni Arsenal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">My wife was still working at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mount Sinai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">She hitched always, a ride with a coworker. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">And <span class="BUILDING">Picatinni Arsenal</span> had a layoff and I, through the layoff process -- they call it dariff -- I found another position at Potuxin Naval Air Station, here in <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">So, we moved to <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">My wife got a job as a technician, medical technician in <span class="BUILDING">LaPlata Memorial Hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">And from Potuxin Naval Air Station, I got a promotion to David Taylor Model Basin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">Do you know where it is?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1227">QUESTION:  For accounting, oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1228">ANSWER:  And from there, I got a job back with army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">Potuxin and Carderuck, or David Taylor Model Basin were navy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">I got a job back with the army in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1231"><span class="BUILDING">Army Material Command</span> , which was the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> -- again, as an accountant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And then, after about working for Army Material Command for some eight or nine years, I realized, through the Affirmative Action that I am going no <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">But the army paid for my Master’s degree program and I decided to go for a Ph.D. And the army had no interest in my Ph.D. So I started paying for it from my own pocket and I selected international affairs as my project -- Ph.</span><span class="sentence" id="1234">D program. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">And I started going to <span class="BUILDING">Catholic university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">And, in 1988, again I had here a problem with a colonel, who was director. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">In the meantime, I gained -- I was ob -- able to obtain a changeover from accounting to international programs division, with AMC -- with Army Material Command. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">And the director was a colonel who was a bigot, first class.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1239">QUESTION:  A bigot?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1240">ANSWER:  Yes, and anti-Semite. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">And he created the situation -- very unpleasant situation where I was almost forced to resign, either to be fired or forced to resign.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1242">QUESTION:  What happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1243">ANSWER:  Well, to make a long story short, as I see it -- that doesn’t mean that it necessarily was so -- he was an old bachelor who was trying to sleep with every girl he could have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">And many young girls took the bite. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">In the div -- in the international programs directorate, we had couple openings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">Every time a girl came in for a promotion, became engaged to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">Once she obtained the promotion, she disengaged and went back where she came from with a higher grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">And on the third occasion, I mention it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">Not what he is doing, because I had no right, but I said, ‘How 1s it possible -- look, these girls are coming here, not only getting promotion and then transfer back, but I am here trying to get a transfer to a different director, without promotion, and I cannot do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">Please help me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">And he felt threatened, and he created a situation where he wrote me up for every single, every simple deficiency. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">I handed him a project five minutes late, he wrote me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">So I itkerminated to the fact that I either had to be fired or to resign. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">So, instead of preventing being fired, three days before the deadline, I resigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1255">QUESTION:  And where did you go from there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1256">ANSWER:  Oh, for about four months, I went -- worked on the economy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">I worked as a night auditor for L’ enfant Plaza Hotel, here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DC</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">I worked for a month as a shoe salesman for <span class="BUILDING">Bloomingdale’s</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">The shoe salesman experience from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morrisstown</span> came very handy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">Then I got a position which could have lasted 180 days for the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> , <span class="BUILDING">US Post Office</span> , selling stamps over the ph-phone, to collectors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">And worked as an auditor for “House of Ruth’, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DC</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">And all those weeks I had floated application as an accountant, back for federal employment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">And I got a call from the <span class="BUILDING">Library of Congress</span> , for a position in my old grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">But, <span class="BUILDING">Library of Congress</span> , at that time, the chief told me that they have a huge computer in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , which is not utilized at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">And through my experience, they would like me to activate the computer and start it providing data that the computer should be generating, if I want the position. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">Two days earlier, I got a positive interview with military district of Washington, as an accountant, a grade lower, but asking me to do almost a very similar job that I used to do for Army Material Command, as an accountant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">So, I had a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">Grade higher, but working with a computer, or grade lower, but doing more or less the same accounting job I did before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">So I have selected the lower grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">And I work for next eight or nine years for military district of Washington. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">For -- we stayed for about seven years at <span class="DLF">Half Street</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DC</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">Shared that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> with FBI and [indecipherable] Investigating Service. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">And then we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">But, you know -- from where I retired in last -- in 1997, in May. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">Interesting thing happened now -- occurred to me that when I got the job with Army Material Command, in the international division, the Pollard case came into existence.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1281">ANSWER:  And I represented the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Israeli desk</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">So I was investigated whether I had some connection to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">But Pollard was navy, I was army and we had absolutely no connection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1284">QUESTION:  And were they suspicious of you in any way because you had lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1285">ANSWER:  It may have crossed their mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">But I was never affected by Pollard’s mishap. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">Then our -- one of our colonel’s -- but that affair you probably don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">Maybe you never knew it, Gillespie was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">They had some problem with identifying missiles in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">He was also my boss. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">It -- It -- Yo -- It made headlines in Time magazine and in all the papers, but 1t was a short -- relatively short-lived affair.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1302">QUESTION:  Can you talk a little bit about your -- I mean, you’ve had citizenship as a Czech, and as an Israeli, and now as an American.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1303">ANSWER:  Okay, to clarify you that -- that issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">Czech citizenship, at least I didn’t know about it in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">Apparently all those -- those 10 years that I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , I probably was a Czech citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">Although, something goes through my mind and I cannot find evidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">The Czech government, after the last transport of Jews left from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , the Czech government advertised in it’s newspapers and through it’s <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> overseas, that all Czech citizens who will not return to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> by such and such a date, will lose their Czech citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">So, I lived under that assumption in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , that because I have not returned, I have lost my citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">Then, in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , upon your arrival, they ask you right in the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> or in the port of you arrival, whether you want to be an Israeli citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">And if you say yes, from that moment on, you are an Israeli citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">They don’t care whether you are citizen of another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">From here on, you are an Israeli citizen and you have the right to Israeli passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">One hour after you land in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , you are already there a citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">If you say no, then they let you live as a non-Israeli, but you still have to fulfill the obligations, like any other Israeli. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">They just don’t trust you as much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">Coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , nobody asked me -- I came under the Israeli passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">Working for Army Material Command, there came an opportunity -- they advertised some vacancies -- under the Civil Service in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> -- if you will remember, when <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> surrendered to <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , that desert. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">What it -- it’s not the <span class="DLF">Sinai desert</span> , it’s -- yeah, it’s the <span class="DLF">Sinai desert</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">When <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> gave back to Egyptian -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , <span class="DLF">Sinai desert</span> , the Americans came that they will finance in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> some <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> which Israelis have lost in <span class="REGION">Sinai</span> , to Egyptian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">And the Civil Service was looking for people who would be willing to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> as servants. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">So I put application in, but I still had Israeli citizenship and I was afraid that there will arise a conflict. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">On the one hand, my being Amer-American employee and on the other hand being Israeli citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">So, I went to Israel1 <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> and I -- I renounced in writing my Israeli citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">And as a result, my son and I lost it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">We have a letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">My wife never was an Israeli citizen to -- to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">But interesting thing now happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">When <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> shed it’s Communist flavor, we Czechs here assumed that all of us who left <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> from 1948 until today, will gain back Czech citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">Matter of fact, gain it back I think was wrong way of phrasing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">I don’t know whether I knew that we lost it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">But what came now to light? </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">The new democratic government of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> proclaimed that we are not longer Czech citizenship -- citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">Because <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> signed, in 1928, a mutual treaty whereby -- in which you gain one citizenship, but lose the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">And the Czechs began to enforce it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1342">ANSWER:  Everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">Czech citizenship -- I would not object if the Czechs gave me back the citizenship, but it would be purely for sentimental reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">I would not have any advantage in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">It just would be a good, warm feeling that my mother <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> still knows that I exist and that I’m her son. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">That I’m not like stepchild. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">How is it called, that -- that -- that Walt Disney’s play with the girl with the golden slipper?</span></p>
