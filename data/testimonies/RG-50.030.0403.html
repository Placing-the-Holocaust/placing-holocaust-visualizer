<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  I was born <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , in 1930.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  And tell me a little about your family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  My family are -- if we go back a few generations, they have been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> for I would say hundreds of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And my father’s family was mainly in the wine and cheese business. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And my grandfather on the part of my mother, he was a merchant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  And what did your father do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  My father was an employee of the national bank of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  And did your mother work as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  No, at that time women were minding their own <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and they have maids to the do the work, and they were very happy that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Were you fairly well off as a family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  I would say upper middle class.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  So did you have maids in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  My parents, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">One. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">One maid.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  And how long did you live in --
ANSWER:  In -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> for five years, and then my father was transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arta</span> and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Preveza</span> , and in 1940 we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrini</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  And why -- why were you moving so many times?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  That’s -- that’s probably the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> would do it with this -- their employees.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  And what is your earliest memories of your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  I remember everything that happened from 1935 on, I have a very clear memory of everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  Were you conscious of the fact even though you were only six years old in 1936, of st -- things that were going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Did you remember hearing things about the Nazis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  From -- we knew that there were Jews who were passing from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> on their way to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And I remember in 1938 a friend of my father told him that in case of need, I would like you to change your identity and you and your family go to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of my father in a remote <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">mountain village</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  Did you think that was a possibility? </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Did your family think that was really going to happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Well, at that time seeing what it was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and seeing that we had a fascist dictatorship in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , everything was possible, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Did you experience anti-Semitism as a young boy? </span><span class="sentence" id="33">This is before the Italians came, before the Germans came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  No, the -- the first time I was aware that there was something different if you are a Jew, was when I was going to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , and we went for a parade, and then, although we came to the staging point quite early, we had to wait and I didn’t like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So I told the teacher why are we waiting, and other <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> have come after us and they pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And the teacher, who happened to be a Christian, said we are the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , that’s why we have to wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So I realized that being a Jew was not a good thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  Did that bother you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  Did you go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and talk to your parents about it, or --
ANSWER:  I don’t remember that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  And did you talk with the other kids about it, or wa -- this was --
ANSWER:  My -- I don’t remember that either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  When you moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinio</span> in 1940, yes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  There were very few Jews in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  That’s correct, there were only 40 Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinio</span> , while there were almost 2000 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> , so there was a big difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="46"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinio</span> was called also <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vrahori</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Evraiohori</span> , which means a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Because in 1821, there were 200 Jewish families in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And what happened to these 200 Jewish families, I think has significant meaning and it explains in my opinion why there were so few Greek righteous Gentiles in the second World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I counted in the Yad Vashem list something like 124 names plus 40 spouses. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And in my experience, I know of 12 other righteous Gentiles who should be in that list, and they are not. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">But still the numbers are very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And then, in addition to that, the losses of the Greek Jews were great. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">89 percent were transported outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> and 87 percent were killed, or 67,000 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">So what happened in 1821 was a very little known historic event. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">The Turks killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> the Greek patriarch of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Constantinople</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And they forced four Jewish porters to throw his body to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">When this became known to what was then <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , and at that time <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> was much smaller than it is now, the 5000 Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> were massacred. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">A few who survived were converted to Christianity. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">One of the leaders of the Greek nation, Kanellos Deligiannis was a great righteous Gentile of that period, and he saved 12 Jews whom he hid in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tripolitsa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">The anti- Jewish feelings of the population were so strong that Deligiannis was forced to keep these 12 Jews hidden in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And only in 1824 he was able to secretly move them to the Ionian Island of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zakinthos</span> which it was not then under Greek control. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So, going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinio</span> and the 40 Jews, these people have come mainly from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arta</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">There were many small merchants and one of them was a teacher who during the war became one of the five leaders of the resistance in our <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">His name was Yunas Munis. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I would say about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinio</span> that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinio</span> has the distinct honor of being possibly the only <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="REGION">German occupied Europe</span> where all the Jews did not obey any German regulations and they all survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And I really can’t think of any other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where something like that happened, but I should say that we were very fortunate that we did not have a rabbi, and we did not have any community leaders, because in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> the rabbis and community leaders, with one or two very rare exceptions proved to be totally incapable of facing the problems that the German occupation presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Did you -- did you move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> before the Italians attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  That -- that -- that’s correct, the -- we moved in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> sometime in March of 1940, and yeah, <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> on October 28", 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">About this war I would like to say that the Jewish -- Greek Jewish participation was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Out of 77,000 Jews, 12,800 were -- served in the army, and that included my father and many of my relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Over 500 were killed, including a cousin of my mother’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Over 3,700 were wounded, including at least two or three of our relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">To these numbers I would like to add the 1,600 Jewish Palestinian volunteers who served with the British expeditionary force. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And one of them was the father of the former Prime Minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , Shimon Peres, and he was not able to be evacuated with the British and he became a partisan of ELAS.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  I would like also to say that the greatest Greek hero of the second World War was a Greek Jewish colonel, Mordechai Frizis, who, with his troops, stopped the Italian advance, giving the allies their first victory of the second World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Mordechai Frizis was killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  I don’t know when this happened, you joined a national youth organization that was actually a fascist organization --
ANSWER:  Ah, yes, that -- that’s --
QUESTION:  -- can you --
ANSWER:  -- that’s quite --
QUESTION:  -- talk about that some?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  -- yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> we were only two Jewish boys among 1,000 students in the -- the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And I’m grateful to the people who were in charge, because every able bodied boy was a member of the youth -- the fascist youth organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And I’m grateful to them for not knowing that Jews were not allowed to join that fascist organization, or knowingly they allowed us to join them. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I know that I was going around giving the fascist salute f -- until the war started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  And why were you glad that no one kicked you out, or --
ANSWER:  Because I never liked to be discriminated against. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So being a fascist suit me fine, although I did not realize that it was so bad at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  And what were you doing in the organization? </span><span class="sentence" id="88">O -- th-they obviously didn’t talk about Jews or do racial things, did they?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  No, no, they -- they did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">They -- w-we would parade, we would -- we -- we had lectures about Greek nationalism. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Th-There was nothing offensive as far as I know at that time, you know, about th-this organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  So you were about 10 years old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  And how long were you in that group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  Until October 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  So when the Italians attacked?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Yes, then the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> actually closed, and we were very glad that the classes ended, without realizing what the war meant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  So <span class="BUILDING">school</span> closed in October --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  -- or November.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  And a -- when the war started it closed, and then it started again in -- in other <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , some <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> , because the <span class="BUILDING">school buildings</span> were used as <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  So did you then go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  And with the same teachers and the same kids?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  Yes, everything the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  So the fact that there were two Jewish students in the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , the Italians did not kick out the Jewish students?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  The Italians? </span><span class="sentence" id="107">F-First of all, remember that the war started on October 28", but the -- and the Germans attacked in April of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Only after that time the Germans first, and the Italians second, came. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">The Italians were excellent in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">While in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> the 50,000 Jews lost their civil rights in 1938 with Mussolini’s Aryan manif -- manifesto, in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , thanks to the Italian commander general Carlo Geroso, we enjoyed all civil liberties. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">The -- we were able to -- to go to -- to the -- to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , while the Italians were not able to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Actually there were 94 Italian university professors who were dismissed, five Italian Jewish admirals, and five Italian Jewish generals who were dismissed. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">But in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> we enjoyed all freedom and Carlo Geroso refused to cooperate with General Lohr, Alexander Lohr, the German general in the persecution of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So we were very happy with the Italians, and we -- we lived a very normal life in the <span class="REGION">Italian zone</span> , business was as usual, we went to the movies, and my mother was making cookies which a neighbor of hers, Maria Demardi used to send to <span class="BUILDING">partisan hospitals</span> , once the partisan movement became stronger.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  So between 1940 and 1942, life does not change very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  Life was absolutely beautiful for us under the -- under the Italians. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And there -- there was one moment that the Italians asked us to register, and none thought anything of it, and they registered, and I know of only one person from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Preveza</span> who did not trust the Italians, only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And he took his parents and went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Th-That’s how he survived later on the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">But we registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And -- I’m ashamed to say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And 30 years later I found out that Mussolini made a deal with the Germans that they were supposed to -- to arrest us, and move us to camps in the <span class="REGION">Ionian Islands</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">But of course, you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> capitulated and this did not happen, but the Germans came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  You know, you wrote in your book that you, at first the family, 1t seemed, had hoped that the Germans would occupy rather than the Italians because you thought they would be better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  That’s another unfortunate kind of thinking in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , but remember that in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> at least 30 to 40 percent of population were pro-German. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">That’s a significant number. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And because the -- the Greeks defeated the Italians in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , we were afraid that the Italians might come there and be vindictive, while the -- the Germans actually did not find significant resistance because many Greek generals were pro-German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  So you were surprised?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  We were surprised that the Italians behaved in such a nice way. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I have to say that the Germans behaved very well too, when they entered our <span class="REGION">area</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  And they entered your <span class="REGION">area</span> in April of nin -- ’43?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Sometime at the end of April, 40 -- °41. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Only in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> they did not behave well, but in our <span class="REGION">area</span> they passed through and they did not bother anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  But your -- your <span class="REGION">area</span> was the <span class="REGION">Italian zone</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  I happened to be -- because my father was mobilized, we were in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> when the Germans came in first. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And they behaved very well, they did not bother anybody, although the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> of 2,000 approximately, people existed there, and they -- they ju -- simply passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And then the Italians came, and they behaved very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  So you moved back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> to --
ANSWER:  Yes, from -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> , once my father became a civilian again, we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrini</span> , and my father went back to his <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">In other words, the Germans passed through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> --
QUESTION:  In °41?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  In ’41, and since this was the Italian zone of occupation, they did not stay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  The Italians were in charge until September of 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  Then, once <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> capitulated, the Germans came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">When they came in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinio</span> and they -- they loved the fact that the Italians were so afraid of the resistance and they had their <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> fortified, and with all kinds of guns around them, and they wanted to give a good lesson to the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So 120 elite German troops went on 12 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they moved straight towards the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the partisans in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thermi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">What they did not know was that this lady I mentioned before with the cookies, Maria Demardi, who was fluent in German, had become the interpreter for the German commander of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrini</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">The partisans were waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Out of 120 Germans, one wounded motorcyclist returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , and he -- even he died in -- within two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And the Germans tried to keep it secret, and they did not even retaliate or shoot any hostages. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Well, they learned their lesson and that meant that in the future they would not dare to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> unless they had a very strong force, which served us very well later on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  So, how did your life change once the Italians capitulated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  Well, from one point of view, you didn't -- it did not change much. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">There were little things, like for example, the -- we had the neighbor, the director of the bank of agriculture, whose in -- in -- the Germans wanted to -- to buy one of -- one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">His mother wanted somebody to go there while the Germans were in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">She selected me. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So here I am, a 15 year old Jewish boy, going there, you know, to protect the old mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I find a very handsome, young German, very polite, and I thought we became friends because since he did not know Greek, and I did not know German, we played with the word good. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And we figured out we knew it in Latin, ancient Greek, German, Fr-French, Italian, Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I -- I knew it in Hebrew too, but I kept my mouth shut. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And then all of a sudden I said, English, good. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And the German became furious and he slapped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">The mistake that I made was that I was thinking in terms of the word good, and he was thinking in terms of people good. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And obviously he didn't like the English people. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So I -- I understood that something was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Another thing that happened was I was sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> of my -- our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and I saw a German chasing a young man who obviously was a -- a man of the resistance and he was shooting at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">The German entered the <span class="INT_SPACE">courtyard</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> following the resistance man. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">The -- the man of the resistance passed through the first floor <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and jumped out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> right under my <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">The German entered the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and he saw the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> leading to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and the <span class="DLF">door</span> was open. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">He ran through there, passed through a <span class="INT_SPACE">corridor</span> , came right next to me in the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">He aimed at the resistance man down below, and he pressed the trigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">The gun jumped. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">The German looked at me to see whether I was happy, but I was petrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">So he looked at this guy in disgust, and he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Another thing that -- that happened was the Germans would send German soldiers to search the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> for weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And I remember a very polite, middle aged German knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , my mother opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">He indicated he wanted to search, he opened one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> , and my mother pretended that he was an honored guest and she treated him the way the -- a -- a guest is supposed to be treated in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> by offering him some sweets, you know, in a little plate with a spoon and a glass of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">The German felt embarrassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">He did not search anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">He bowed politely and he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Another little --
QUESTION:  Were you -- were you there --
ANSWER:  I was there, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  -- at the time? </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Were you frightened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  No, I wouldn’t -- I mean, with the exception of the slap, that wasn’t a very strong, I -- I didn't have any bad experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">The next thing that happened was we bought a horse load of wheat. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And the villager who brought the horse with the wheat told my father, in this bag there is a gun and ammunition for your friend Christos Bokoros, who was one of the leaders of the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Well, my father wanted to get rid of the gun as soon as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So within a few minutes I had a basket with the gun, the ammunition and some other unimportant items, and I was supposed to go to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bokoros</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">My father thought I was going to go through the <span class="DLF">back streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Not me. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I went through the -- through the main <span class="DLF">street</span> , through the main square of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I even touched a German as I was passing. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And I realized that what I was doing was dangerous only when I gave the gun to the sister of Bokoros, and I saw how -- how frightened she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So basically that’s how our life was until one day -- Yunas Munis that I mentioned before, the teacher, went to my father and told him, you know something, the -- one of the merchants, I think it was either Misann or Munis, went on business to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> to buy merchandise. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And he found out that all the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish shops</span> were closed, and he was told that the Jews went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">So he came back to us, and he told everybody, and we are all going to leave, and I’m leaving tomorrow morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So we -- although we didn’t know why the Jews went into hiding, we were not going to -- to wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And we got ready to go, but we didn’t know where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">So we asked one neighbor who was a right wing man. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">He told us to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arta</span> , and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arta</span> to go to the area of -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zerbes</span> , General Zerbes who was the right wing partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">The only problem is how -- how do you go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinio</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arta</span> , you know, it was a good idea, but it’s not possible to -- there was no real transportation and up til that time, we were using mainly <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Italian cars</span> for the movement to different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So we asked our other friend, Christos Bokoros, who was with the left wing resistance, and he said, well, come to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I will provide transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">In o - in other words, in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , even a f -- a f -- man like my father, who was an assimilated Jew with -- all his friends were Christians, you know, because they would not -- he didn’t have that much in common with the little merchants who were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">We were friendly, but all his friends were Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Still, we did not know what to do, we needed help. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So we went to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bokoros</span> , and he was going to provide transportation with horses, but all the horses disappeared because a battle was taking place, and both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> used all available forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And my father, who was a good bank employee, he wanted to give his books in good order to the director of the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> , and transfer also the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And he was wasting time. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">A -- a German soldier entered the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bokoros</span> to just look around. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">The Bokoros family became scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">So one of the Bokoros boys went to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> and he told the director, and saw Mr. Matsas working there, if anything happens to him, I will consider you responsible. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">The director, knowing that the Bokoros family was with resistance told him I -- I don’t keep him here, I will sign everything away. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Sure enough, he signed the money -- for the money and everything without even counting it, and my father went to wait with [indecipherable] in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Well there, since h-he couldn’t find any horses, he go, how about a tax1? </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Sure enough, he brought the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> there, we loaded all our food supplies, clothing and everything else, and put it -- some more people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> , and we left in style. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Within minutes we were at the control point, a German soldier checked the identity cards of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">The driver gave to the German some cookies and raisins, and that was the last German I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Nobody had violated any rules or regulations, and nothing was punishable, there was no crime involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">We simply went out, and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Within minutes we saw the first partisan of ELAS. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And I have to say I took a look at his hat, and I saw the word ELAS and I thought I discovered a spelling mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Ellas, which means <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , is written with two |’s, and he had ELAS with one | because this was the ethnic [indecipherable] status, meaning Greek liberation army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">QUESTION:  And what was the politics of that -- of that liberation army?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">ANSWER:  We knew nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  You knew nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  We knew nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">All we knew that these people were fighting the Germans and only actually after the war we found out that many of the leaders were communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">But they were fighting the Germans, the -- they did not know any more than we did, and all I know 1s that they had beautiful songs which I loved and I still sing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">QUESTION:  Would you sing one of those for us?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">ANSWER:  Oh boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Yes, why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="233">You mean now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I will give you the translation first. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">One of them starts like that, that there’s thunder in the mount of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olympus</span> , and there is lightening in the mouth -- th-the mount of Jonah. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> [indecipherable] are roaring and [indecipherable] is shaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And then it extols him, asks all the people to take up arms and fight for freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So, [sings in Greek here]. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">That’s one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">QUESTION:  That’s very nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">ANSWER:  So, with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> we went to the end of the <span class="DLF">road</span> , s-some 30 miles away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And then we rented horses, because we wanted to be as far away from <span class="DLF">roads</span> as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And we pass through really unmarked <span class="DLF">paths</span> , there were no wheels in that village of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">The people there, unless they went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , they never saw a wheel, because it was very difficult terrain on the slopes of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">But very beautiful, overlooking a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , which now became a -- a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> , thanks to a <span class="DLF">dam</span> that they made. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">We went there as students. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">We knew that nobody would bother us because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was very well organized in terms of the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Th-There -- there was - there was active ELAS, which were the partisans, and there was reserve ELAS. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">So there were organizations for the men, for the women, everything was organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So -- so it was a nice <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">We brought with us a lot of supplies to last us for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">The problem was that in November, the Germans decided to go on a search and destroy mission, and the -- we were notified ahead of time -- the villagers were not afraid that anything would happen to them, but we -- and in the meantime I should say some more Jews came to -- to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , knowing that we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">There were two men, and another three people, a couple and a old man who did not even know Greek, he was a ship tycoon, Aaron Romano, who was speaking in French rather than Greek. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And so we were --
QUESTION:  Can I -- can I interrupt for one moment?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">ANSWER:  Certainly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">QUESTION:  When you got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , how did you get a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">ANSWER:  We rented. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">We rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">This -- we had with us plenty of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">My father unfortunately had only cash. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">He did not have any gold, that was a big mistake, because thanks to inflation, the money lost all it’s value within months. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">So we rented a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we acted like tourists. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">We didn’t hide the fact that we were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">As a matter of fact we were going to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> every Sunday because we didn’t want the -- the people to think that we were different, with the exception of the fact that we would not make the sign of the cross, or eat the wafers, or the pieces of bread that y-you know, a -- a Christian is supposed to -- to have at the end of the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So with the exception of that, we were very friendly with the priest, who used to come to my mother’s <span class="NPIP">place</span> because we were the only ones who had coffee, and he liked to have coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And the life was beautiful, and the -- it was li-like a vacation, until the Germans came. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">When they came, we -- by now we were f-four of us, and two, six, we were nine -- four, seven -- we became 10 Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And we decided, and the people of the resistance told us that we should go higher up, and they told us that there is a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> very high up in the mountain of 300 feet, and you should go there and stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">So there were only two little donkeys that could be used for -- for supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So we loaded a little donkey, but un-unfortunately we had to leave all our supplies in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And we went to the -- to the top of the -- of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of [indecipherable] and we stayed there, and the Germans stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> for -- I -- I should add that Mrs. [indecipherable] Levy, a socialite from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> decided she had enough, she wasn’t going to go any -- any further, and she stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And she spoke fluently German and French. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And she spoke with the German officers very, very well, and -- and n-none of them asked her how come a lady like her ends up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And -- and it didn’t take long and the Germans left, and we came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">When we came back, we found out that we lost all our supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Now, the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , who has a reputation as a thief claimed that it was the Germans who took it, who took everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">My mother went right into their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and searched and she found some of our items. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">The -- later on we found out when the villagers made the report as to how -- what things they lost, 1t was mainly bottles of Ouzo, bottles of wine, and they would say, with the entire bottle. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Because for them the bottle was more precious than the contents of Ouzo and wine, which they could make by themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Therefore, I’m convinced that it was this man, [indecipherable] who was the thief, and not the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">But we knew that the partisans, in order to establish some sort of tranquility and -- and e-eliminate [indecipherable] and fear, they have killed even a partisan who stole a -- a chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And therefore, we decided to keep quiet, not to report him [indecipherable] the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">We wouldn’t want to be responsible for an execution. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And we thought, well, we have more supplies in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> and we will bring them. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Unfortunately we were not able to bring as many supplies as we needed, so we had some starvation later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Now, the fact that Mrs. [indecipherable] Levy decided to stay and the Germans were very polite, turned against us the following month, because the Germans made three attempts at research -- at search and destroy operations. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">In November, in December, and in the following August. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So, in December there was another alarm that the Germans were approaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">This time, Mrs. [indecipherable] Levy persuaded my mother that the Germans are not dangerous they behaved so well. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">My mother didn’t like the idea of going up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , but also, she didn’t want to abandon our supplies for fear that -- that they will be stolen again, although we had to change <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> because this man not only he resented the fact that we called him a thief, especially after we found things hidden in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but he asked us to leave because we insulted him. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">He didn’t realize that we saved his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And we moved to another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that we also rented. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So my mother decided to -- to help Mrs. [indecipherable] Levy in her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , since the knew German so well, and -- and stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">But a neighbor who saw that, told the lady -- she was a -- a [indecipherable] a former policeman and his son was a partisan and he told them, what makes you believe that there will be the same Germans, or they will became -- they will be just as polite as they were before, or they might not have orders to ar-arrest you as suspicious individuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">So she forced them to come up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain lake</span> with it, but fortunately the Germans did not come this second time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Are you curious about what happened the third time, in August?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">QUESTION:  Well, did anything happen in between?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">ANSWER:  In --
QUESTION:  Between February and August?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">ANSWER:  -- in between, with the exception that we faced starvation because the -- the war between the Germans and the partisans intensified, and while before it was so easy to get in and out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , it became more difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So the end result was that -- that it was not easy to send a villager in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> where my father had stored his supplies and get from a -- one his friends there, who was -- he was -- it’s -- it’s hard to understand that, but the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> was trying to help the employees even with food supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">So one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> had food, and an employee would take care of food distribution to the employees of the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">So this man also had our supplies with instructions when my father would send a man to get whatever we wanted, but this source was -- was lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">So we -- we really suffered from -- from starvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I mean, but this is not- this is the least that can happen to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">QUESTION:  But what kinds of things were you able then to eat? </span><span class="sentence" id="308">This was true of a lot of people in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> at this time, right, that this was very bad --
ANSWER:  Well, not -- not -- not -- it was -- it was bad only in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , not in the provinces.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">ANSWER:  The provi -- provinces had plenty of food, and people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> would come to the provinces to get food. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">In -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , as long as we were not [indecipherable] there was no problem, it was like peacetime. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I mean, you had as much food as you wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Only when we lost our supplies and we were not able to get the quantities that we needed, only then -- we had basically to eat a lot of wild vegetables. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I had -- that was my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I had to go, with a knife, and get anything that was green on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , that the animals would not eat because they were -- these things were bitter. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And then my mother would boil these things and mix them with a little corn flour and she would put just enough oil on the -- on the big, big pot, and cook them. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I found out eventually that this cellulose can be absorbed by the body. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">So basically, that’s what kept us alive, because we could eat enormous quantities of these because I would get, you know, bi-big quantities and we would eat that. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Basically, that’s what th -- that’s what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">The one thing I can say 1s that at -- what helped us at one point was the fact that a partisan unit came to stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And we told them that we were starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And they offered to de -- I mean, they -- at -- at night, when they had their meetings, all the partisans voted in favor of giving us a -- a portion. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And also to the family of [indecipherable] Levy. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And -- and when the -- the trumpet would -- would sound, I would go in <span class="DLF">line</span> and get a portion -- the partisans were not fed very well either, mainly th-they had a corn soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">That’s -- that was -- and a few olives. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">But we would divide that portion that was for one man, we would divide it into four. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And in this way, w -- for the duration of their s -- their stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> which was maybe 20 - 25 days, we did not touch our supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">That proved to be very, very important because ultimately we did not have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And on that day, one of the men of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> -- actually he was the leader of the reserve ELAS, he -- he told me to -- to go and collect berries, and by that time there were berries, as many as you wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">We ate berries for four days and we all became sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">At that point we didn’t know what to do because the [indecipherable] production was going to come within days, but not in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , which was on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">So my mother and I took the last supply that we had, which was sugar, and we went down, we crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> of [indecipherable] and we went to a [indecipherable] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of a [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And there we exchanged sugar, which nobody had, for [indecipherable], which was some cereal that had milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And that was the turning point in -- in our food situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Once the time came that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> had produced -- had -- had a lot of things, 1-1-1n the meantime we -- we realized what we had to do, but that’s a little -- it’s a little -- another story, because we had -- well, where to find parachute material, but this happened accidentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">When e- in April, or at the beg -- at the end of March, my mother decided that she sh -- would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> and get supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And my father and myself -- I-I was at that time 13 going on 14, my sister was only five to six, so my father an-and myself told her not to go, but she was very str -- opinionated and she decided to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And she walked for practically 12 hours to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And at one point she had to cross a -- a -- a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , and one of the guards there was a partisan -- a Jewish partisan [indecipherable] from Arta, that my mother knew him. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And he told her, don’t you know that the -- the -- the Jews have been arrested, and they are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> in warehouse of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Papapetrou</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Of course my mother did not know anything, but she -- I have to say that before that my mother was stopped by a -- a teacher of mine who recognized her, and he told her, where are you going? </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Don’t you know that the Jews have been arrested, and in addition, don’t you know that the Germans executed some 200 Christian hostages because of the war that takes place between the Germans and the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And my mother said that -- of course she felt very bad, and sick about -- hearing about the Jews, but she was determined, and she said, I have to go, I have to get food. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">So the -- the teacher said, why don’t you go until the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> that is very close to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , and -- and stop there at the <span class="DLF">mailbox</span> , and th-this is a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of a godfather of mine, and he 1s a teacher in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">You tell them that I sent you, and send him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> to get the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So my mother explained to the partisan [indecipherable] that this is my plan, and I’m not going to go beyond this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , which was in the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , and he let her go, and that’s what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">She met the teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">The teacher went with his horse to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">He happened to be a godf -- he was a godfather of the director of the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> -- this is a tremendous coincidence considering that [indecipherable] is the director of the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> , was supposed to be a descendant of the families which were converted in 1821. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Svordis was a common Jewish name in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Svordis could have been also one of the -- the convert families. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And my father claims that even the intermediary between the two of them, Zambaris, that was the nickname of the Levy family of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">So, it -- it’s a -- an amazing coincidence to have all these three people being godfathers to each other, and been involved in helping my mother at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Now, when he went to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> with the horse in front of it, the director became terrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I mean th-th-th -- under these conditions, getting food on a horse that is going to go outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , the whole <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> can be considered guilty of doing something wrong, as far as the Germans and their collaborators, and there were plenty by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">There were the security -- Greek security battalions active at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">So the only thing we were able to get thanks to that expedition was some quinine and some sugar and some tea that could be placed in the pocket of -- and when the man came back, he was not satisfied to leave my mother there, it was a-approaching nighttime when neither the partisans would allow anybody to move, nor the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">So he proposed to my mother that they should go to sleep in a small <span class="BUILDING">church</span> that his grandfather had built of prophet Elia. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Even that to me is significant. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And [indecipherable] went and zamp -- Zambaris -- that’s name, Zambaris and my mother spent the night in that little <span class="BUILDING">church</span> on top of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> where it was cold, and the wind was blowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Then the following day, my mother came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">When she told us what was -- what happened, o-of course she was exhausted, you know, a-after 24 hours and -- and the trauma of knowing, a-and -- because they made a mistake and they told her that the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> were also there, which means that all our relatives were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">So she was really a wreck. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">But in spite of that, she wanted to go on another expedition in which the British mission which was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Priansa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">That time we were assured that as soon as the allies would know that the Jews were arrested, they would immediately mobilize all their know-how and all their means at their disposal and the Jews would be s-set free. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So again my mother -- you see, my -- my father had some problems, he had some pain with his legs, and he couldn’t walk at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">So my mother again, and myself, we embarked on an expedition of approximately a total of 14 hours of hiking in unknown <span class="REGION">territory</span> , crossing and re-crossing two <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">That means four times crossing <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Priansa</span> where we had a meeting with a British major who -- his friend, a -- a prostitute who was there told us -- well, I-I should say this, passing on the way there, we had to stop in a -- 1-1n a controlled partisan point, which was manned by our banker from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrini</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And he told us [indecipherable] we -- we told him what was our mission, what we wanted to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And he told us to go to this lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">There were other prostitutes there who were so-called working for the British mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And he told us that this particular girl was the girlfriend of the British major, but evidently, she was also in contact with the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And he told my mother to go to her and she will be able to talk to the -- to the major so the major will -- would be a little bit better to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">But when we went there and we found her, the first thing that she did when she saw how I was dressed, because I was -- I was wearing my short fascist uniform, a blue uniform that it was strong material, but because my legs were exposed, my mother had s -- had sewn or attached to them some woolen leggings. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">So I was dressed like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Soon as she saw that, she gave me the leftover [indecipherable] khaki pair of wi -- winter khaki pants that she had cut them to make shorts out of them, and she gave us the leftover, you know, so my mother can make some -- a better pair of pants for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And she said that she had an argument with the major and he was not in a good mood. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">But nevertheless, the -- the m-major saw us, and he was very nice, and he knew French so my mother spoke to him in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And he promised to send a message to -- to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , and a -- a message to my father’s sister who lived at that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">But we know that the message in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> never went. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">But we were in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , we realized that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was filled with parachute material because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> were coming at night and they were dropping weapons and ammunition for the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And there was plen-plenty of parachute material. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So my mother went from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and she begged these villagers, who didn’t know what to do with this material, and we collected a lot of material, and cord, and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And when we came back, my mother, who had an elementary knowledge of sewing, she went into the business of -- of -- shall I stop? </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">She went into the business of making shirts, and we used some material th-that we brought for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> , to make pants out of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And eventually she changed these materials by going to different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> for years, you know, did not have any material. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And we collected enough wheat and corn and everything else to last us for the next two or three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And but this -- this is the story that is related to food. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I -- I bet --

QUESTION:  Mike, why were the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> going into hiding at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">ANSWER:  We found out about it much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Who -- what happened was this. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">The Germans asked the chief rabbi of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , Elia Barzelai to give them a list of the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">The rabbi of course had -- was given sa -- some time to prepare the list and during that time the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , or important Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> found out or they knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And one of them was a -- a Greek Jewish journalist, Baruch Schibi, who was one of the leaders of resistance in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">He was a man from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> who never intended to be in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the Germans were, and when the Germans were entering <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , he attempted to leave and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , and he reached only <span class="COUNTRY">Crete</span> and then you know when the Germans attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Crete</span> with the parachutists, h -- and he was not able to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> and he returned back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">He knew what happened to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">What happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> was that the leadership with Rabbi Koretz proved to be very ineffective. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And since the Jews did not know that the Germans were killing Jews outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , they did not have the incentive that a hunted animal has. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And you know, when somebody is hunted, the instinct of survival of course, is you -- to either flee, hide or fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">The -- the situation was such that although the German intentions towards the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> proved to be bad from the beginning, only the wealthy Jews, some 3,400 of them took advantage of the fact that up til February 1942, they were able to freely and legally move from the Bulgarian and German zones of occupation and go to the <span class="REGION">Italian zone</span> , where the Italians were living very well as I told you before. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">The remaining Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Macedonia</span> , and that’s where the great majority of the Jews were, they did not know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">I feel they were like children who needed help, and nobody was ready to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">So in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> the organization ELAS proposed to the community to help, but the leaders of the community refused this help. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">The communist party proposed to help, and they suggested that the Jewish children should go to trusted families of the party, and the rest of the population to be dispersed outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> as long as it was free and legal to do -- to do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">But this proposal was rejected by the leaders also. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">So basically, you have some over 50,000 Jews there not having any leaders, not knowing what was going on, and furthermore, not having Christian friends, most of them, as a result of anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">The population in <span class="COUNTRY">Macedonia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> was either indifferent or hostile to the Jews, and the proof is that out of over 10,000 Jewish families in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> , only one family, that of Haim Pardo, of five people was offered a shelter in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of Dr. George and Fedra Carracortso right in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> where they stayed indoors for 18 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">There was some other 70 Jews who were saved in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> , but these were mainly husbands, or fiancés of Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">The -- the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , or the other organizations of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> did not protest, did not do anything, but some lawyers protested to the general governor -- the general governor Simonides, he said, we are removing the thorns from your <span class="DLF">garden</span> , and you are protesting? </span><span class="sentence" id="417">The -- the one who pleaded with the Germans was the bishop of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> , Yanadios, who asked them to use magnanimity and clemency, especially when the time for the deportations came, and he -- he is considered as a righteous Gentile. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Another protest for which <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> should be really proud was made by the archbishop of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , Damaskinos, and it was signed by 42 members -- leaders of Greek organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And in this case, what really happened was that the -- these people would meet periodically to discuss the problems of the occupation, and one day a Jewish woman from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> told him what was happening, and the poet [indecipherable] Yanosh wrote the appeal, it was signed immediately by all 42, and it was delivered to the Germans, and to the government of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">The prime minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , Logothetopoulos, instead of trying to protect the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> when they were deported, he confessed that he was in favor of the deportations because there would be a lot of vacant <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> that was needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">So, 252 Jewish students from the <span class="BUILDING">University of Salonica</span> became partisans of ELAS, over 600 Jews became partisans of ELAS. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">When the proposals of the communist party were rejected, the communists th -- remember that they had 150 members in their lists who were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So they appealed to them to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Out of them, 75 decided to go, but as they were divided into three groups and they were going for the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , they thought, and what about our families? </span><span class="sentence" id="425">How are we going to let our families be by themselves in exile? </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And they came back and they surrendered to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Now, Baruch Schibi knew all that, and he was afraid that the same thing was going to be repeated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">So he conceived the plan of abducting or killing Rabbi Barzelai of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">The other leaders of the resistance agreed with his plan, and they went to the rabbi and they told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Rabbi was ready, he said I’m -- do anything you want with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And they took him and his family and they moved them to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">When the word went around, the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">However, there were poor Jews who at the beginning they thought they would hide too, but they needed to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And they started going into the -- into the -- th -- to the Germans, and the Germans kindly extended their deadline and allowed all of the Jews who would come slowly [indecipherable] they would come and the -- the Germans wouldn’t do anything to them more, they would come -- this was noticed by none other than an American consul general who was operating from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And in the state department where there are 500 pages of documents sent from Consul Berry, Brigadier General Tindall, and Ambassador Makvay of [indecipherable] 500 pages. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">In one of them this situation is noticed by a b -- a -- Burton Berry, who s -- who tells the state department that -- that we need a little financial assistance here because the poor Jews are reporting and now they tell them that they should report within a 15 minute interval, which means that the Germans want to arrest them within that 15 minute interval. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">All these reports were ignored, and filed in the archives, where I found them in 1975. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Eventually 1,000 Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> were registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">But things became nice again. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Everything was normal up til March of -- 25"" of March 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">That was the time that the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> [indecipherable] that my mother was supposed to -- t-to find in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> if she went there, were all arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And the -- a-and -- and Burton Berry in another document says, didn’t I tell you that this was going to happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And -- and he gave other warnings. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Actually, the most important warning that he gave was the following. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">There was a -- a -- a Greek Christian merchant, Michael [indecipherable] who, a-as I said before, business was as normal as it could be in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">He went on business, he was a tobacco merchant, and he was going on business to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">In his <span class="INT_SPACE">train compartment</span> -- evidently he was traveling first class, he started a conversation with three German SS officers, who told him point blank that we are going to stop here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Larisa</span> because we are on our way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Corfu</span> , where we will deport all the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Corfu</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">In other words, the Germans were so sure that nobody cared, especially a Christian merchant, that they told him a military secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Now, this man was a good man. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">As soon as he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> , he went straight to the American consul -- <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> , and he told Burton Berry what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Burton Berry immediately notified the state department, and again nothing happened, although it was so easy to make a radio contact with the British military missions. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">British military missions had contact with the resistance, which existed in all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , not to mention secret American and British agents which operated in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">All of these people could have notified the Jews and tell them what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">It took -- fr -- from these reports, it took until June ninth, the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Corfu</span> were arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">In the German archives, even the German commander of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Corfu</span> send a report to his superiors, a lengthy report in which he was trying to tell them that there is no need to do anything towards the Jews, they have never bothered us. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Evidently he -- he said, we don’t have any means of transportation, why don’t you arrest the -- the Italian soldiers of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bertolio</span> who are -- are dangerous? </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Th-The Jews never bothered us. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Out of 2,000 Jews, only 187 returned from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So this 1s the -- the -- the story with the -- the state depart -- and the American -- American government. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Now, Baruch Schibi continued his activities as a -- a leader of the resistance, and he was responsible for the mili-military intelligence during certain battles in the [indecipherable] where hundreds of Germans are working.</span></p>

QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">ANSWER:  -- there was only an <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> of four years, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I -- and I -- actually I took all the schoolbooks with me and I confess -- confess that I did not open them even once, although I consider that year as the -- the most formative and important year of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And -- and actually when we came back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> -- we left on October third, 1943, I came back on October third or fourth of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I wrote down all the memories of that year and I entitled it, “One Year in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Mountains</span> ,” and I gave it to my teacher of literature to see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">He kept it for six months in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> , and he gave it back to me without making any comment. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I gave it to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">He looked at it, and he made a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> under the -- the heavy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining room table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Because I loved the partisans, and I loved their songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And immediately after the war, what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> is this, <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> 1s the only country in Europe where those who fought the Germans lost their jobs, they -- after the war, they lost their jobs, they were imprisoned, they were exiled, or they were executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Not all of them of course, you know, but -- but -- but most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Maybe I shouldn’t say most of them, but -- but a great number of -- of the resistance fighters suffered this- this fate. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">As a matter of fact, there -- there were even some Jewish partisans who were executed, and one of them, the most important Jewish -- Greek Jewish partisans, who was an expert in agriculture, Lazarus Azarias, he was a brilliant man and a highly organized person, and he was in charge of supplies for the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And he was so effective 1n hi -- in this job, that immediately after the war the Greek government condemned him to death in abstentia because he managed to escape and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , where he became eventually, the director of Nuva, which is one conglomerate dealing with produce.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">QUESTION:  And why did this happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="501">What -- why was this response to the partisans? </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Was it only ELAS that they were responding to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">ANSWER:  Yes, not ELAS, ELAS was the right wing partisans, they didn’t bother them. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And [indecipherable] my father’s first cousin was a -- a doctor who was an officer in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ELAS</span> , a medical officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">What happened was that e -- that Churchill and Stalin divided parts of Europe in zones of influence. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And the -- that <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> was part of the British zone of influence. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So when the war ended, the -- the British w-were afraid that the -- the army of -- a -- of ELAS, which had communist leaders, they were afraid that they might take over, so what they -- what they did is they -- they landed troops in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> but th-they needed allies who would be their natural allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">But the former German corroborators who were in the security battalions, and the provincial police which also collaborated with the Germans, and I don’t know about the police in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> because the leaders of the police were [indecipherable] and Evert are considered righteous Gentiles because they issued false identity cards for many Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">But the fact is that all these groups were, including the -- especially including the German collaborators, they were the force that took over in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , and -- and therefore, anyone who had to do -- anything to do with the resistance became a -- a communist suspect, including me. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">What actually happened with me is that when I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> at the age of 17, I needed a -- a special police permit to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> to -- to take the entrance exams for the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , for the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">So I went to the police to -- to take the -- the permit, and to my surprise, they refused it. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">So, I said I wanted to speak to the chief of the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I went to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and he was sitting there with the [indecipherable] who I knew he was a German collaborator, and the leader of the paramilitary fascist organization, X. I didn’t like that, but I told the chief of the police, why don’t I get the -- the permit? </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And he reminded me of the fact that I was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I know I was in trouble already and there was no need to ex -- no use to explain to them that I was a Jew, most probably they knew that already. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">But by that time I had become streetwise, so to speak, and I remembered that my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> principal had been arrested by the partisans as soon as they moved into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> because he was -- he was an eloquent speaker, and he extolled and asked the Greek youth to imitate the German youth in the fight against the evil forces of the allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">So the partisans put him in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> together with [indecipherable] and many, many others. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And the British released them from <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">So, I also knew that I was one of his best students in his subjects, Latin, ancient Greek and modern Greek. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And so I told the chief of the police, I understand that you don’t know anything about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">The only thing -- the only one who knows me 1s my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> principal, because I’ve been a student up til now. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Was, you know, 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">The two of them looked at each other and smiled, and the chief replied, if you bring us a paper from the -- from Mr. [indecipherable] who they knew very well, you have no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">So I went straight to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because he was sick in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and I told him what happened, and he became furious. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">He immediately dictated a -- a letter to his son who was there, and he -- but this was a serious business. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">This was not, you know, just a letter, he asked him to go to the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and ask a specific professor to have this typed, and -- and have it stamped, and -- and return it to him for his signature, and then take it to the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And I remember that he was ending his letter of recommendation by saying that I have nationalist feelings and Christian ethics, although this man knew perfectly well that I was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">So this is my experience after the war as a -- as a man [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  Did your -- your father work for ELAS, the --
ANSWER:  My -- my father -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> as I show -- I told you, everything was very well organized, it was -- it wa -- all the branches of the resistance were represented. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">My father, since he was a bank employee, they asked him to be the -- in charge of ETA, which was the provisions for the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Now, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was extremely poor, and the provisions that my father collected were insignificant, but still my father officially, he was the representative of ETA in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">When we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , the Germans had left enormous <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> filled with supplies, which had not been able to take with them when they were abandoning <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">So the partisans occupied all these tremendous <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> of [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I remember they were filled to capacity with things. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And they asked my father if he would like to be the director. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">My father was so grateful to the partisans, he -- he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So he was the director of the <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> until the partisan army was destroyed, which was maybe three -- three or four months later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">QUESTION:  So go -- go back to your being in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> in that last push by the Germans in the summer of °44.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">ANSWER:  In August.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">ANSWER:  In August of 1944, this time the -- some -- a s -- a column of -- a column of 600 German troops, assisted by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and mountain artillery advanced again through this particular <span class="DLF">road</span> that we said [indecipherable] and then at that point, the partisans this time ordered the evacuation of all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="541">So this third time that was the most serious out of the all three times, I was feeling very happy, because this was the first time that it was not only we the Jews who had to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and go to the top of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , but everybody had to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So sure enough, the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">We went to a <span class="DLF">plateau</span> overlooking the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> below, and --
QUESTION:  And how many -- how many people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">ANSWER:  In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Over 300. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">With their animals and everything we went to this <span class="DLF">plateau</span> and at that point the teacher of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> approached my father and he said, if a German patrol comes here, they might arrest you and me and take us as hostages. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">So we better go and find -- I mean, actually he found a -- a good <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , away from the rest of the villagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">So we went with him and we found ourselves in a sort of a <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> , which was covered with a -- the branches of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">A <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> with a magnificent view of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> below, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Apiscope</span> and -- and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And I was able to see from a distance the column like -- like ants, it looked, the soldiers moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And then what happened was that the partisans attacked the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And a ferocious battle took place for almost an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And then, when the German artillery started firing, then we knew the situation was really bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">But the partisans, when the artillery started firing, they withdrew, and it became quiet again. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And that was the time that the -- the little ants that we saw before started -- starting at different <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and then smoke would be coming from these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">They were burning the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Apiscope</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">We did not see them, they did not have a chance to -- to burn our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , but we -- but they -- they left within a couple of days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">QUESTION:  And then you returned back to --
ANSWER:  Then we came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where we found all our supplies intact because there was -- Mr. [indecipherable] was not there to take care of us again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">QUESTION:  And then what happened, was that the -- close to the end?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">ANSWER:  Yeah, August, this was August sixth, and the Germans started withdrawing by the end of September, and -- and at the beginning of October we were back where we were before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="561">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">QUESTION:  And what was that like, to return to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">ANSWER:  I had a -- I remember that I was expecting that I was going to be very happy, you know, to come into a free <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">It -- it was a sort of a disappointment, I -- I was not as happy as I expected to be, especially knowing -- we didn’t know what was happening to our relatives, and we were afraid that maybe my grandparents were too old to survive, you know, all this transportation, and that, but we never expected to see what really happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">QUESTION:  And what did you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">ANSWER:  I’m sorry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">QUESTION:  What did you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">ANSWER:  We -- we saw nothing, I mean, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was the same way like it was before, and only when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> and saw the -- there was none of the people that we were -- w-we used to -- to have there, that were na -- there, only then I started wondering why all this happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I had many questions that I had in my -- my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Question number one would be why such a thing would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And the -- my -- my answer was in one word, anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">In two words would be religious anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And I’m very much -- very familiar with the -- the church teachings. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I know exactly what they say, especially during the -- the holy week. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And if -- if you have in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , young children who are exposed to the beautiful picture of Jesus Christ and then you love this person, and then all of a sudden you find out that it was the Jews who -- who killed him, I mean, how would you feel? </span><span class="sentence" id="577">It’s [indecipherable] like I faced that when I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and on Good Friday we were in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and the -- and the priest did whatever he had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">When he came for a coffee to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">he apologized. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And he said, I -- I’m sorry I had to say so many things -- because that’s in Greek, we can understand, that’s not in Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And, I’m sorry I had to say all these things, but you understand, that’s my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">My parents, of course, they understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And the following day I saw a little boy, maybe no more than five, who I used to be his hero, and he used to follow me around all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And he looked at me with suspicion and some sort of hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">So I told him, why, what -- what’s wrong? </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And he said, “You killed Jesus Christ.” </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And I will never forget that. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">That would be my question number one. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">The -- the second question would be when did the allies know about all this? </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I was under the impression that they didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">That’s the reason my mother and I were eating that vegetable pie. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">We -- we -- we walked for 14 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">What I found out is that the British had broken the older police code of the Germans as early as 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And this older police was the one that was in charge of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">There are documents which prove that they knew exactly when a German unit would say, arrest 100 Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , who was the leader of the group, how many men he had under his command, where did he stop on his way to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , or there were <span class="DLF">killing grounds</span> even in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And they -- they documented all that by simply following these radio transmissions. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">So all this -- all this was known. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">The -- the Americans, up til the time that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> declared war against the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , they had <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> and consulates all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">They had secret agents every -- everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">The documents -- I -- I checked only the 500 documents that were related to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , they knew exactly everything to the point that rather than interviewing survivors when I wanted to -- to find what was going on, I preferred to read the -- the reports of Burton Berry. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">He was a far more eloquent writer than any of these survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">So they knew what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And then the third question is, why didn’t they do anything? </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And again, the answer comes in these words, religious anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Even in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , there was discrimination against the Jews in terms of employment, and the -- the real historians know now that the state department not only blocked immigration, blocked information, they even tried to cover it up to the point that the -- that the -- that the secretary of the treasury sent a report saying acqul -- acquiescence of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to the murder of the Jews of [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">That’s serious stuff, ac-acquiescence. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And then you have other people who, like Professor David Wyman, who says that I, as a Christian, he says he -- he’s appalled that the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> did not do anything and they remained silent in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Let alone the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> , let alone all the -- the bishops of all <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So this is the -- the old story. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">But I have to say another thing, that like I mentioned before, the Jewish contribution, the Greek je -- military Jewish contribution with Colonel Frizis. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And this was very important and <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> has to be very proud of that because the action of the Greek army delayed the German attack against <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> by six crucial weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">The Germans were forced to fight a winter war in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , which was -- had disastrous consequences for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">So this I would say is the direct contribution of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , indirect contribution of -- of Colonel Frizis since he was the first one who stopped the Italians and then advanced as -- ahead of his troops, although he was killed later, but this was a great contribution. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Then you have all the Jews who fought in the British forces, including I would say the son of the first president of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , Haim Weitzman, who was shot down over the <span class="DLF">British channel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And then there were 550,000 American Jews who served in the armed forces of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">In other words, when we asked, why didn’t the allies help? </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I say, this is not a case of benevolence, or a case of -- of charity, the Jews earned and deserved the right to be assisted. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Not only that, let’s not forget that if <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> became a nuclear power, which guaranteed American supremacy, it was because of Jewish men like Einstein, Oppenheimer, Ziller, Teller, Rabbe, while the relatives of these Jewish men were dying in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Personally, I believe that it was wrong, unfair, ungrateful and shameful for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and Great Britain to abandon the Jews and let them die the way they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="620">QUESTION:  What about the Greek population during this period of time?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="632">ANSWER:  He contacted Rabbi Koretz, and he tried to reassure him that everything would be alright, that the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> -- I mean, accept the deportation, the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> has -- have <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> for us and jobs and everything will be alright, there’s nothing to worry about. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">But -- but he was not satisfied, so he went to the chief of the police of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Veria</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stavridis</span> , and that’s another righteous Gentile that I would like to add into -- into my list of -- of the 12 or 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And -- and he told him not to listen to the rabbi, not to trust the Germans, just go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Now, to see how easy it was to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , my friend had a senile 85 year old grandmother, and they were not going to leave her behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">So, they ended up w-with her on a horse and they had to cross a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">raft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">raft</span> was very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">She was on the horse, she could not see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">raft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="639">She moved to the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and for the rest of her life she was talking about how -- about the miracle that took place like in the time in Moses, that the waters parted, and she passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And it would have been done, that’s -- that’s exactly the point that I want -- I -- I want to say, but you had to have some Christian friends, because the Christians knew far better as to what -- what had to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">In addition to that, it was the Christians and not the Jews who had friends and trusted relatives in the remote mountains of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , where there were hundreds of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Why they were in s-such inhospitable <span class="NPIP">places</span> , where they had to -- to cultivate things from <span class="DLF">terraces</span> , because during 400 years of horrible Turkish occupation, that’s where they had their freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And they would have sent -- who -- you see, when the leader of the communist party was talking about sending them, dispensing them to -- to our side, he knew what he was talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">But the Jewish leaders wouldn’t want to have anything to do with somebody like him, and all -- all ri -- so were waiting to see what their -- what -- they were waiting for whom? </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I me -- believe there was Koretz who was collaborating with the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">QUESTION:  You would say that Koretz collaborated? </span><span class="sentence" id="647">You would use a strong word like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="648">ANSWER:  I -- well, I would say this, he was not a bad man. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">His wife, Gitta Koretz send me a 48 page letter in which she was trying to -- to -- to justify his actions, that he was an intellectual who knew t -- 12 languages, who -- who had a Ph.D. in oriental studies, who could have left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> and go with the mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , who invited him to leave and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , and he didn't want to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">It’s possible that he thought that 1t was only a deportation, I -- I can’t tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">But if I were there, I -- and -- and I saw what the Germans were doing, especially when the Germans as- assembled in -- in July of 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">They assembled 9,000 Jewish men age 15 to 45, and they humiliated them, they tortured them, they -- and -- and then they started forming slave battalions in -- wh-which had to work under inhumane conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">That was the time when there was free -- I mean, it was e -- it was legal, and they were free to move, to go to the <span class="REGION">Italian zone</span> , or go to these remote <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , provided of course, they had the proper connections with -- with the Greek villagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And that’s what was missing, since they did now know what was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">But wh-wh-why do -- should they accept deportation? </span><span class="sentence" id="656">I mean, isn’t it better to be free? </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And think of all the tons of gold and precious items and supplies which were looted by the Germans and their collaborators. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Can you imagine if all this gold and supplies would have come to the resistance? </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And let’s think of how much the -- the Jews would have contributed to that resistance, because we had thousands of men who were experienced fighters from the war against <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> in ’21 and ’22, and the war, the second World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">You have experienced fighters who would never surrender, because any Jewish partisan who would be captured by the Germans would be executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">So you would have a -- a great contribution to the allied effort. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">What a -- a -- a waste of -- of -- of manpower, and a-as a former military officer, I can say this, I remember the -- a poem by Haim Nachman Bialik, who said -- but it was related to something else, but the words are very appropriate. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Great -- great is the sorrow, and just as great is the shame. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And I ask you, oh son of man, which is greater? </span><span class="sentence" id="665">The grandsons of the Maccabeans went to their death like lambs, wherever they were found. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And to see what some of these grandsons of the Maccabeans could do, I will tell you something about the -- perhaps the greatest partisan victory of the second World War, which took place on May sixth, 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I said before there were thousands of Greek traitors who were not punished after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">There was a group of five Jewish families from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Larisa</span> , who established a camp on the slopes of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mount Olympus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="669">They were betrayed, and an s -- n-s -- SS battalion went one morning and captured them. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Three Jewish men attempted to escape, and they were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">The f -- a fourth man was able to escape and notified a nearby partisan unit of ELAS, which included Jewish fighters, like the legendary platoon leader, Marko Carasso, and even a cousin of mine who was a -- a teacher of literature, Joseph Matsas. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">150 partisans ambushed the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">The terrain was perfect for an ambush. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">The battle lasted for around six hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="675"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> came to help the Germans but they were ineffective. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">The Jews eventually were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">There were 150 German dead, 78 wounded, and 14 taken prisoners, including one who was the son of the German general of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Aegean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">He sent a message that he would release 200 hostages that he had for his son, but the message arrived too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">The partisans executed the 78 wounded, and the 14 prisoners for a total of 242 German dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And the Germans never again attempted to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> to capture fugitive Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Partisan losses were eight dead, and 10 wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I have the names of the eight dead, and I believe they should be considered as righteous Gentiles, because they could very easily have said we don’t want to try to save the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So far, I mean, this can show you what the partisans could have done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">QUESTION:  Do you think the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> in 1943 knew what was happening in Europe, in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">ANSWER:  There was, until the end of the war, there was not even one Jew in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> who knew anything about the Holocaust or about the fact that the Germans were killing Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Not a single thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Because the Germans had t-total secrecy. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">As a matter of fact, Professor Breitman mentions that the Germans attempted to -- to keep this secret from -- especially the Jews, but also from the outside world and the German people. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">They were successful in deceiving the Jews, but they were unsuccessful in keeping it secret from the outside world or the German people. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">In <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> not even one Jew knew anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">The first time that we understood what was going on was in the movies when we saw Eisenhower visiting the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="693">If we knew what was going on, there are survivors who say that under no circumstances would they have entered the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Who would do that, to -- to -- to take his -- his children, his wife, his parents, in an orderly fashion to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that led them to -- to -- to the -- to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="695">As a matter of fact there have been cases like I mentioned before the -- the 75 Jewish communists who returned to follow their families and there are two cousins of my father from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> who were also on business on the day of the arrest, and they returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> to be with their families in exile, and they never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Nobody knew.</span></p>

QUESTION:  -- you didn’t -- your family didn’t know either, what was happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">ANSWER:  This is correct, but we had connections. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">In other words, we had the right wing friend who -- who told us where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">We had the left wing friend who told us come to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we will send you out. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">If we didn't have these two people, we would have, if nothing else, procrastinated. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Two days after we left on October third, two Germans appeared in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> , and they asked for my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Now, if we judge as to this visit from what happened in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , my assumption 1s that my father was going to be a hostage of the Germans, and if he were a hostage of the Germans, my mother would never have left him to -- a-and go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , even if we were allowed to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And -- and another thing is this, we left before the order for registration came. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">We did not know there was going to be any order for registration. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">We left only because we heard that the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> went into hiding, we didn’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">We simply -- we were simply determined not to obey any German orders, that was our only -- but we had friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">This is the -- the -- the problem that I -- I see with all the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">They did not have any friends, they didn’t know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">If you have people around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> who -- who are glad that these things happen to you, and they are eag -- they are eagerly waiting to see what kind of looting they are going to do, and there was extensive looting in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where there were Jews, they are eager to see their competitors being demolished, how in the world do you expect any assistance from these people? </span><span class="sentence" id="712">And considering that -- that the Jews did not know that deportation meant anything but deportation, and -- and having leaders who could not really lead them, and not having any good advice by their friends, they were waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Now, once you are registered, the story changes. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Then what you do is dangerous if you try to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Of course, the friend of -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Veria</span> , with the 85 year old mother, left while they were registered, and while they had the yellow star, and my friend said that as soon as he was in free territory, they took the star and they threw it to -- to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">But it took much more bravery on their part to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">That’s why the most important thing in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> is that the -- the deportations started very late, in March of 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">The Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> were already dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">The Warsaw ghetto uprising was taking place at the exact same moment, around March, April, 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Up til that time, the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> had plenty of time to disappear and dissolve, you know, in -- into eight million Greeks in a remote -- in [indecipherable] <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , whereas I told you, the Germans had to mount expeditions including 600 men, that -- that was not easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And even if they did, where could they go the -- since there were no <span class="DLF">roads</span> , and -- and there were impenetrable <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> and -- and terrib -- terrible <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and -- and -- and unknown parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Plus, there were the partisans there. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">So the situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> was great for the Jews to -- to -- to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">In addition to that the -- the Jews would have gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , because the partisan organization, the naval branch of the partisan organization called ELAN had formed a -- in -- in agreement with the Jewish defense force Haganah, they transferred some 1500 Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> and from there to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Even the prime minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , George Papandreo used this method of escape from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">So there was this in addition. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I believe since there were so many traitors, including six Jewish traitors, and I -- I would like to -- to mention something about them, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I mean, we were not innocent, we had six Jewish traitors, all in collaboration with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">So the -- since there were so many traitors in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , so I would say the approximately 6,000 Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> who were saved, were saved either by going to the free partisan controlled areas, and -- or they stayed with -- in that work of resistance sympathizers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> who volunteered their services, and there are no cases where the [indecipherable] for example, they w -- they were appointed to go into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for one man, but the -- the -- well, 1 -- this is a case where it shows how the Italians were very helpful in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> , where they saved hundreds of Jews by giving them Italian citizenship, and they moved them to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="730">But in the case of the [indecipherable], what they did was they acted as if they were prisoners of the Italians who were going to be judged 1n an <span class="BUILDING">Italian court</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="731">So they were taken to the <span class="REGION">Italian zone</span> , and then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , but the Italian soldiers knew the address where the resistance told them to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">They di -- because these people did not know anybody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="733">How could you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> unless you know somebody? </span><span class="sentence" id="734">So the resistance provided a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">So the Italian soldiers went to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and they said, do you know something? </span><span class="sentence" id="736">We went to our commander, and we told him that we brung -- brought the prisoners here, but he said where are the prisoners and we couldn’t produce you, so how about if you give us some money? </span><span class="sentence" id="737">So the SS were afraid of blackmail on the part of the Italian soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">They gave them some money and then they notified the resistance they were to leave this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And sure enough the resistance says all right, you go to that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Went to that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and -- and they stayed in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> until the end of the war, reading Mr. [indecipherable] all the books that he found there, teaching French the grandchildren of the -- of the men, and the man was very proud because he saved, he said, a -- a British soldier, a communist and now a -- aj -- a -- a couple of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">So it’s -- it’s a combination. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">You had to know somebody, which --what [indecipherable] the poor Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> , there was a lot of poverty in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> , they did not know anybody.</span></p>
