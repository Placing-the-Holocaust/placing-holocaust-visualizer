ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Did you grow up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Well, I grew up there until I was 10 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  And at that time my father's business moved to <span class="REGION">Vermont</span> , and of course I finished my education there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Johnsbury</span> , <span class="REGION">Vermont</span> , and then in 1940, I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in 1935 and went to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Florida</span> --I'm sorry--Vermont. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And in 1940 I got into the military service and stayed for ten years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Let's back up a wee bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">What sort of business was your father in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  He was a machinist, and his company moved to <span class="REGION">Vermont</span> for, I guess, for tax purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And did you enjoy it there in <span class="REGION">Vermont</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Growing up there, I enjoyed it better than I did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">What was the name of the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> that you went to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  It was <span class="BUILDING">St. Johnsbury Academy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Was that an allboys school or was it coed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  It was coed. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">It was sort of a semiprivate school. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">It was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> founded by the Fairbanks Family. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">It was the only <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and every student in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was entitled to go to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and get a good education.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  And did you enjoy it there? </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Did you participate in any sort of extracurricular activities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">This was during the Depression years in the 30s 35, and I had to work to actually pay my way, buy my books, and pay my way through <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So I didn't have much time to be involved in the outside activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  And how did you do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="28">How--what sort of work did you do while in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  Well, I was a stock boy in a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> for awhile, and worked for a company Standard Brands as a stock clerk there, and that's about all that I did in the way of work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And did you have any friends there? </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Did you meet your wife in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> for instance?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I had a lot of friends that--when I left <span class="REGION">Vermont</span> in 1940, I came down here to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Blanding</span> , <span class="REGION">Florida</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And spent--been a year training here, and during that time I met this young lady that, eventually, three years later, we married and we have been hanging around together ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And what made you decide to go to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Vermont</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Had you set your sights on that from the go--
ANSWER:  Well, I was in the business administration.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  You graduated in 1940?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  Did--tell us about your decision to go into the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Were you drafted, or did you volunteer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  I volunteered at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I was out of work, looking for a job, and employers were very hesitant about hiring young men who had not had their military service, but the draft system had just kicked in a short time before that, and they did not want to train new employees for two, three, six months and then lose them to the military.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  So they declined employing young men who had not had their military training; so I decided to get my year's training over with and come back and then be able to get a job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  And exactly what were the circumstances of that? </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And where I'm going with this is did you seek a commission or did you enlist, and how did you come about your commission?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  To get my commission?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I got into the local Company K of the National Guard in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Burlington</span> , and we came down here to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Blanding</span> and trained here for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And we're getting ready to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> back to <span class="REGION">Vermont</span> , and the Japanese dropped the bomb at Pearl Harbor already; so we're in (?</span><span class="sentence" id="56">full duration? </span><span class="sentence" id="57">05:29) and there's no going back to <span class="REGION">Vermont</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So the unit that I was with, the 43rd Division, was then prioritized to go to the Pacific and start fighting the war down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And at that time, I was chosen to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Benning</span> to go to an <span class="BUILDING">offshore candidate school</span> , and I spent three months there training and became a second lieutenant my commission there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  What rank had you attained in enlisted ranks?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  A second lieutenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Just before became a second lieutenant, what rank has you attained in the rank?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  I had risen up through corporal and sergeant. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I was a sergeant when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Benning</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  You said you went in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">What--were you conscious of the fact of what was going on in Europe, and did you see a likelihood of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> entering the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">At that time, I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I could see the clouds of war in Europe, but it was still far away and really didn't see the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> getting involved in the war at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">It was not until later on '42'43 that I began to see that they we're going to get involved in this thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  And tell us about your experience in <span class="BUILDING">officer candidate school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">What was that like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  Well, it was rather difficult because I had been working with the--a supply officer in the 43rd Division, and I did not get the full extent of the basic training of the [(07:32)]| that all the rest of the guys got. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And so when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Benning</span> , I was at a disadvantage because I had not had the basic training. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And I was competing with other sergeants who had had the basic training; so I really had to do my military basic training at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Benning</span> during the officer candidate course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  And how did you fair there? </span><span class="sentence" id="78">How did you do in the end?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  In the end, I did well. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And more than likely I got my commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Very good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  If I hadn't got my commission, I'd have gone back in rank to my original unit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  So you said, you know, when the Japanese did attack Pearl Harbor, that's when you realized--<span class="COUNTRY">America</span> --that we were 1n it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  That's correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  Tell us your outages about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">What was that experience like? </span><span class="sentence" id="87">When did you hear about the attack on Pearl Harbor? </span><span class="sentence" id="88">How did it effect you? </span><span class="sentence" id="89">What was your feelings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Well, I felt that this was going to get us into the war because the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor, but the Japanese were tied 1n with the Germans as the Axis powers and that, in turn, was going to draw us into the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  And, you know, I felt confident at that time that, hey, we're going to go over to Europe or to the Pacific and fight these guys, and we're going to get this thing over with maybe two or three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">That was a little optimistic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  Indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So when were you--when was the decision a made to send you to Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Give me that again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  When did you go to Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">When I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Benning</span> , I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Wheeler</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Georgia</span> , and remained there as a training instructor for 14 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">At that time we had invaded <span class="REGION">North Africa</span> ; so we became involved in the <span class="REGION">European scene</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">At the end of that 14 months, I got transferred then into the 30th Infantry Division which was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Forrest</span> , <span class="REGION">Tennessee</span> finishing up their summer maneuvers there, and they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Atterbury</span> in <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And I joined them there the first of November of '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And they were prioritized to go to Europe, but we didn't know that at the moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We didn't know where we were going to go, but we were doing our immunizations, and the final firing and familiarization with weapons and getting prepared for combat somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Atterbury</span> the first of February of '44, and not knowing where we were going, we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and we ended up at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And it was only then that we realized that we would be going to the <span class="BUILDING">European theater</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  And how were you sent there? </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Did you go by--I assume you were shipped out by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We shipped out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> on the 12th of February on the SS Argentina, and we joined a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> just outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">There was a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> that came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newport</span> News, Virginia. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And it was the largest <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> that ever crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And we went to--our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Glasgow</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> , and from there we entrained down through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and to the south coast of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bognor Regis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And that's where we stayed for the next six months training for the invasion if and when it came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">How was your <span class="DLF">crossing</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Did you have a good <span class="DLF">crossing</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  It was a relatively good <span class="DLF">crossing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">We didn't encounter any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">enemy ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We had all kinds of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">battleships</span> with us, and periodically we could see them darting out on some sort of a mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">We just assumed they were out chasing a sub somewhere, but we had no problem in going across. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">The weather was fairly good but in the <span class="REGION">North Atlantic</span> in the winter it's never very good, but we didn't encounter any storms or anything; so we had a fair crossing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Was that your first time out of <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I had been to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> if you call that out of the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> , but first time overseas, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  What did you--you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> for how many months again? </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I'm sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  Until June, about five months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  Did you interact with the British?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  I'm sorry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Did you interact with the British?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  We did somewhat, but not a great deal with the--I think you're probably referring to the British Military, but the British civilians, we had more contact with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  What did you think? </span><span class="sentence" id="135">What did you think of them? </span><span class="sentence" id="136">How did they treat you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  They treated us very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">They were very happy to see us come and help them because they had been in the war for four years already. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">German bombing and that sort of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  So that were very happy to see us come and help them out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  But we had a very good relationship with the British civilians.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  Very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And I just want to back up a little bit so we don't get too far ahead of ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">By this time--I'm referring to you being in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> before being deployed to the continent to combat that is--were you--by this time you were married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  No--yes, I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I married in March of '43.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  And you had met you wife at <span class="BUILDING">university</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  No, here at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Blanding</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">She was teaching at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jacksonville</span> at that time, and I met her there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jacksonville</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Tell us about how you met.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  How we met?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  That's kind of a long story. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">The people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jacksonville</span> were very hospitable and we, being Yankee boys at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Blanding</span> away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they thought it would be nice to invite the soldier boys from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Blanding</span> to their various <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and civic organizations where they put on dances and get togetherers with the young people of the <span class="REGION">local area</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jacksonville</span> , and of course we were macho guys, and we wanted to have our beer on Saturday night. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And when we'd go to those dances or whatever function they were having, all they had was soft drinks, and we didn't tend to go for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So we declined a lot of these invitations and it got to the point where nobody was going on a voluntary basis; so the army decided we can't disappoint these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">You're going to have to go whether you like it or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  They volunteered. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">You, you, you, you, you get Class A uniform on, and you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So I was one of those that got tiered to go, and I went to this dance one evening and met my wife and we were attracted to each other; so we started up a letter communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">There was no email back in those days; so the only way we could get together was to write, and SO we just worked up a nice relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  And you recall the first time you saw her, the first time you laid eyes on her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  And what was that like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I didn't get that question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  What did you think when you first saw her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  Well, I just thought she was nice looking girl that I'd be interested coming back to see her again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  So we started writing back and forth, and we'd go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jacksonville</span> and visit with her and met her family, and that was when I--I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Blanding</span> and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Benning</span> and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Wheeler</span> and sort of picked up the writing communication again with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And I decided it was time that we got more serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">We did, and 1n--I think it was January Ist of '42, I invited her to come up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Wheeler</span> , and I give her an engagement ring, and in the following March we were married there at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Wheeler</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  That was a lovely way to start the new year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">In a way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  Indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So let's go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> then. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">You're in the South of England. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">You're writing to your wife at that time as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  Oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  What was it like being away from her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  Well, of course I missed her, but we were so busy working, training, that I didn't have much time to dwell on the fact that I'm away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I'm lonesome. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I was--of course I missed her, but we just had so many activities going on that we didn't have time to get homesick.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Had you had children by that time or not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  I'm sorry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">QUESTION:  Did you have any children at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">No we did not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  So when did--when was it made clear to you that you were going to be sent into combat that you were going into continent, and where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  Well, we were on the south coast of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and we could hear the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> of the Air Force going over every night. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Bombing somewhere over on the continent and, of course, everything was top secret until the--well, actually it was the 5th of June. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">At the night of the 5th of June, we heard this tremendous roar of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> going, and that just continued on and on and on. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And we're not hearing any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> coming back; so they were making a wide circle, bombing and then coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And it was continuing on all night, and this was unusual because normally they would--the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> would go out and we'd hear them coming back, and that was it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">ANSWER:  So we knew that that was probably the beginning of the invasion, and of course then the next day, we read in the newspapers that the invasion had started and right at that time we were moved to the marshalling area near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">South Hampton</span> in preparation for the <span class="DLF">crossing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Now on D Day, the Ist and the 29th Division were the assault troops to go across the <span class="DLF">channel</span> and land on Omaha Beach and our 30th Division went in behind the 29th five days later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  So you entered the <span class="BUILDING">European theater</span> , <span class="BUILDING">combat theater</span> , at D Day plus five?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">That's right, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">QUESTION:  What was your position at the time of deployment?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">ANSWER:  I was the platoon leader in the heavy weapon company, border platoon leader.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">QUESTION:  What was your first experience of combat, sir?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">ANSWER:  I'm sorry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">QUESTION:  What was your first experience of combat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  Well, it was different than what we expected. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">When we were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , we were all gung ho to go there and tear those guys up and make short of the situation, drive the Germans back and into their own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">But we had done some training with live ammunition, but it was all very closely guarded so that we would not have any casualties or accidents. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Once we got over to Europe, there was no safety regulations, and bullets were flying around fast and furious, and we never knew when the silver bullet was going to hit it us. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">It was an entirely different situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">QUESTION:  Do you remember the first time, the very, very first time that either you received fire or you returned fire?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">It was on the 15th of June.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Where were you? </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Tell me about tt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  We landed on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Omaha Beach</span> , and I can recall 1t very well because this was on my birthday, the 13th of June. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I'm just talking with my wife here. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">We landed on my birthday on the 13th of June and moved into what we call a bivouac area because this <span class="REGION">area</span> had been cleared out by the 29th Division about two to three miles inland and so we stayed in the bivouac area over night, and the next day we marched into this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montmarte Grenyas</span> which the 29th Division the day before had taken but were driven back out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And so it was our job to then get back into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , clear it out, and continue on from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And that was our first day of combat, and we were green. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">We just didn't realize the seriousness of what this whole thing was all about until the silver bullet hit some of our friends, and they encountered <span class="DLF">mines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">They were hit by artillery shrapnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And this was--these guys were being hit, became casualties, and the medics had to take care of them the best they could, and then the next--through the night and the next day we had to get replacements in for those men that were casualties of that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  As a platoon leader, how did that effect you were you--tell me
ANSWER:  I was responsible for 50 men in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">platoon</span> , and everything I did, I had to consider the safety of those men to do the actions that we did in firing our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mortars</span> , locating <span class="NPIP">positions</span> that were best suited for us, and to have protection as best we could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">QUESTION:  And did you lose any men on that day or on subsequent days?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">ANSWER:  That first day, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I didn't lose any men, but in subsequent following men, I did lose some men.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">QUESTION:  That must have been extraordinarily difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  It was because they were men that I had trained with some back in the <span class="COUNTRY">states</span> , and some in through my period in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and during this period of time, you become close to your men and almost like family. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And, you know, it hurts when you see a man get wounded or killed, and you feel a partially responsible for it--although it's not your fault-- you feel that you lost one of your boys, and it hurt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">QUESTION:  You described just now as rather like being a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">As a platoon leader, did you look at the men under your command, were they more like sons to you or more like brothers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  more like sons because, as I mentioned, when I landed there, I was 27 years old on my birthday, and most of my men were 18, 19, 20 years old, what I call kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">ANSWER:  So there was a little bit of a <span class="DLF">gap</span> there, and I felt more or less they were my sons that I had to take care of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">QUESTION:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">What did you think of--you said before going into combat you had that attitude that. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">You were going to go in and show these guys the what for. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Once you had that experience of close combat, what did you think about the Germans? </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Were they good soldiers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  We found that--we really learned that they were well trained, well disciplined soldiers, and they had weapons that were as good as or better than what we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And the only way we gained the upper hand was the fact that we just had more men. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">We had more weapons, more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and we just overpowered them by sheer numbers rather than technical better weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">They had better weapons than we had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">But let's talk about that a little more. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">How did you view them, the Germans, that is to say the German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">How did you view them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  Well, they were good. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">The most of them, the Wehrmachts, were very good soldiers, well disciplined. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">One of the big differences that we found is that they went strictly by the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Whatever was in the training manuals, whatever their leaders told them to do, that's what they did, nothing more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">ANSWER:  But with the American soldiers, we adapted. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">We were told what to do and how to do it, but if that didn't work, then we had the liberty of doing something else that would work, and we had that flexibility which the Germans did not have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Now, as you're moving inland, moving deeper and deeper into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , at some point you came into contact with Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Can you tell us about that first experience with Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">We did not have any contact with Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Now, let me go back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Back in the early training days. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Occasionally, we would hear or read in the newspapers about some Jews being tortured in Europe, slave laborers, and this periodically would appear, but we never pay much attention to it because what we were hearing was that some Jew would escape from some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp--</span> we didn't know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> back in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">We heard there were these camps where they were concentrating Jews and torturing them and using them as slave labor, but the story that we would get was that a Jew escaped from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> went back to his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , and told the people about what was going on in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp--</span> that the Jews were being tortured and used as slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">They wouldn't--they did not believe him. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">The Jewish congregation in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> did not believe him because, like us, we thought of the German people as being civilized human beings, inelegant people, and they would not do that to another segment of human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So this went on, periodically, we would read articles like this while we were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , but when we got into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , we saw none of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">In fact, Jews didn't even cross our mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">That was not why we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">We weren't there to liberate to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">We didn't know about that whole situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">We were there to drive the Germans out of the <span class="REGION">land</span> which they had occupied illegally. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So we were not concerned with Jews, and we never really saw any Jews because the Germans had taken them all out of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to use them as slave laborers. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">So as we proceeded through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> and <span class="REGION">Northern France</span> and into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , we did never saw or had any contact with any Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">ANSWER:  They were all gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  So we continued on through <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in the Battle of the Bulge during the winter of '44 '45, and then we captured the City of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> , which was the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to fall in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And up to that time, we had seen nor heard nothing about any Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Now, we continued up onto northward through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monchengladbach</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hameln</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detmold</span> , and we crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine River</span> on the 24th of March. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Now, up to that time, we had seen nor heard nothing about Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">That was not in our anything that we cared about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">QUESTION:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">As you're fighting along and as you're moving through <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , what have you, is the German resistance getting stiffer or can-do you sense has being an officer that it
ANSWER:  Oh it was getting much less. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">From the time--we had our last major battle in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> at the City of Mortain, and that was the beginning of what we called the rat race, that they were moving back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> almost as fast as they could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">QUESTION:  So as an officer, you could sense them in retreat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  I'm sorry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">QUESTION:  You could sense them in retreat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">ANSWER:  Well, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  So you crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Let's go to that period of time, and you're pressing on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So we were just chasing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">They were doing what we call--I forgot what it is now--sort of defensive action as they were retreating, and the major part of the German army was moving back eastward toward <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they would leave a small segment of men behind to delay us, to create delaying actions. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And that's all we did all the way across <span class="REGION">northern France</span> and up into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and not until we got into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and the <span class="DLF">German border</span> where they had the <span class="DLF">Siegfried Line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">That's where we had to stop and of course they stopped as well, but the reason that we stopped there was that we had run across <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> so fast, we had outrun our <span class="DLF">supply lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Now, all of our supplies had to come across <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , across the <span class="DLF">channel</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Omaha Beach</span> , and by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , move them up daily to supply us with food, ammunition, clothing, replacements. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So it was kind of a slow process, and we were moving faster than the <span class="DLF">supply lines</span> could keep up with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">So by the time we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and the <span class="DLF">Siegfried Line</span> , we had left thousands of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> behind because we ran out of gasoline. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">We just dropped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> off at the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and abandoned them more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So by the time we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , we were out of food, we were out of ammunition, we were out of gasoline. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">So we had to stop there nearly a month waiting for supplies to reach us and become resupplied with ammunition, with food, replacement men before we could make a successful attack on the <span class="DLF">Siegfried Line</span> , and once we got the momentum going, to keep on going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">QUESTION:  When did that happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER:  That was in about February of '44 or '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">February '45 that we crashed through the <span class="DLF">Siegfried Line</span> and we had enough momentum going that we just kept on going, and got up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monchengladbach</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wessel</span> and across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine River</span> , which was the biggest major obstacle that we had at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So we continued on from crossing the Rhine River 24th of March and headed to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brunswick</span> , which 1s in the northern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Now, up to this time, we had not seen nor heard anything about Jews or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">QUESTION:  Now, this should have been around April, was it not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  This was the 10th of April that we captured <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brunswick</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Now, there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> BergenBelsen which was a little bit north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brunswick</span> , because that was in the <span class="REGION">British zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So we had nothing to do with it, but it was there nevertheless. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But we didn't even hear about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">We captured <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brunswick</span> , and then our next objective was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">It was probably 75 or 100 miles further east, and we started moving from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brunswick</span> on toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> , and we came to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hillersleben</span> where there was a large <span class="BUILDING">German air base</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">We captured that, and then there was a number of large <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and we thought nothing of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">We just captured that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and went onto the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Farsleben</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">As we were approaching this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Farsleben</span> --this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> is probably a thousand people at the most. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">We met some soldiers who were walking along the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> westward, and they said that up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Farsleben</span> , the Germans are preparing an attack, an ambush, for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And they are protecting a trainload of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">We didn't understand exactly what they meant by "a trainload of people." </span><span class="sentence" id="331">So we had our reconnaissance unit, which was a few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and infantry men on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> to move forward to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Farsleben</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">They found no resistance in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">They cleared it out, and on the east side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , there was a little <span class="DLF">hill</span> , and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> were still moving forward, and as they mounted the <span class="DLF">hill</span> , and looked down into the little valley on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , they saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> sitting there with a bunch of people milling around doing whatever they wanted to do really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">This should have been--just to clarify where we are in time, that should of been probably the 12th or 13th of April. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Somewhere around there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">ANSWER:  This was the 13th of April.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">ANSWER:  That was when we liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brunswick</span> on the 10th, and I think we liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hillersleben</span> on the 11th or 12th, and this was the next day, the 13th of April, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">We saw this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and not knowing exactly what it was, very cautiously we approached it. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">They in turn--they saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and recognized them as <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And they came rushing forward to meet and greet us. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Then, we found--through a few of these people who could speak a little bit of English, and one of our guys was a Jew, and he could speak a little bit of Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Well, they began to communicate, and what they found was this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> had about 2,500 people on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And it had come from BergenBelsen. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Well, what is BergenBelsen? </span><span class="sentence" id="347">We never heard of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">They told <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">BergenBelsen</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> where they had about 50,000 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">This was the first time, the very first time, that we had ever heard of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">This was the first time we had met any Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">QUESTION:  How close did you physically--how close did you personally get to that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Were you right on top of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  Well, I was not there the first day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">ANSWER:  See, I was with the other unit, and this was the 743rd tank battalion, which was part of our unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">They were the lead reconnaissance group that were up in the very front. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">So they were the first ones to meet this group of people, and I didn't see them actually until the next day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">QUESTION:  And when you did see them
ANSWER:  It was a horrible scene because they had just been liberated--I need to go back just a minute now. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">On the 6th of April, the camp commander of BergenBelsen was aware that the British troops were approaching his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and he wanted to get the inmates of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> out of there as quickly as he could so that they would not see the condition that these people were in. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So on the 4th, 5th, and 6th of April, they loaded up three different <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> loaded with about 2,500 Jews and sent them eastward towards a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , which was another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And that was going to be the final solution for these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">So one was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that actually did arrive at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , and the second <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was captured by the Russian Army, and this was the third <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that had come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">BergenBelsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Now, it took six days for that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to come from BergenBelsen to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Farsleben</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">That <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was made up of what they call cattle cars-- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">They're like our small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">They're a smaller than our normal <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">We had used this type of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> in World War I, and we called them 40 and 8s. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Noting that each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was capable of handling 40 men or 8 horses, and that was the general mode of transportation back in World War I, to move troops around by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">ANSWER:  So these are these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> they call them, 40 and 8s, which we had put 40 men in. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">They had 75 or 80 people in these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And they were locked in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">In the corner of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , they had what we would normally term it like a fivegallon bucket that was their sanitary facility. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And if you can imagine 75 or 80 people crammed into one of those small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> , and the guy over here in the corner needs to relieve himself, there's no way that he can get over to that bucket and relieve himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">So the only alternative he had was just let it run down his legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">So this is the condition that we found these people in. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">After six days of standing--there was no way that they could sit or lay down--the only way they could get on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> was by exhaustion that they would just crumple and fall down to to <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and they just had to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And that's the condition when we opened these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> up that we found these people, stinking from their feces and urine of six days, dirty, lice infested. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">It was a horrible sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Something that we could not believe that was happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">QUESTION:  How did you react when you saw them, and how did they react when they saw you as Americans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">ANSWER:  Well, we were reacted, you know, we didn't believe what we were seeing. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">You know, we could communicate very vaguely because the language barrier with these people, but to see and understand where they had come from, the conditions that they had for those six days on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , it was just nauseating to smell these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">We didn't dare to touch them because we were afraid of getting lice on us, fleas, Typhus--which was very rampant disease in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">We didn't want to actually touch these people at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">They wanted to greet us and hug us and kiss us; so we just had to kind of rebel against them and not have any personal contact with them as much as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Now, we understood where they were coming from and the condition that they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">They were hungry, they had only gotten one meal a day which consisted of a big bucket of soup as they called it which was nothing more but a pail of water with some potato peelings or turnip peelings in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And they were very lucky if they got a few of the turnip peelings in their cup of soup that they got every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">QUESTION:  How were they clothed when you saw them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">ANSWER:  Well, some of them were fairly well clothed. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">The Dutch people and a few of the others were being held more as hostage for exchange purposes with the Americans for some of the German prisoners that we were holding. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">So they were in fairly good condition and clothing was fairly good, but for the most part, their clothes was very ragged. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">They were not in the stripped prison uniforms that you often see in pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">They were in their own civilian clothing, but they had worn these clothes for months and months and months without any possibility of repair. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">If they got a tear in the clothing, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">It's too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And the shoes, they were just worn out. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Basically there was nothing left of their shoes, just the tops. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">They were in horrible condition as far as clothing was concerned and hungry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  As best you could tell from the languages that they were speaking, and you when you were speaking and interacting with them, where were these people coming from? </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Were they primarily Germans? </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Dutch? </span><span class="sentence" id="405">French? </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Italians--
ANSWER:  Oh no. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">These prisoners were from <span class="REGION">eastern country</span> : Hungry, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , a number of them were from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , a few from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">They were a varied nationalities, and this made the communication with them more difficult because they spoke so many different foreign languages that we understood nothing at all accept a few that--there was one girl in particular who was quite intelligent, and she was fluent in about six languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">So she was the main interpreter for this group. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And a few of the others, they had a little bit of what we call Pigeon English. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">They had a word here or there that they could fling out, and we could understand what they were trying to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">It was mostly sign language, but we felt sorry for them because they were so hungry and they saw us in nice, clean uniforms, smoking cigarettes, and eating candy bars. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">They just went wild when we handed them a candy bar or a pack of cigarettes, and they were just be fighting over them. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">But the problem that we did not understand was that these people had not had any kind of food for months. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">They were on a very, very limited ration, and we were eating high protein food, and as we gave them a candy bar or chocolate or something that we had in our pocket, it was so--their bodies just could not assimilate this high protein food that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And they would just gobbled it down, and as soon as they did, they would throw it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And, of course, by this time the medics--we had gotten the medics in there because there was just so many of these people were sick, and had medical problems that we had to have the medical battalion come in and administer care to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">They said, "Hey, don't give these guys any more food." </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And they took over from that point on to care for their feeding, and they took our rations and diluted them down with water.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">QUESTION:  And what were the--you're talking about the rations that presumably the <span class="INT_SPACE">medical ward</span> took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Were those--what were those? </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Were they Krations or
ANSWER:  Yeah, they would take our Krations and Crations and water them down so that they were more easily assimilated by these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">QUESTION:  How long did it take to get those--the corpsmen and the medical personnel--their--how long of a delay was it before the time that you saw them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">ANSWER:  It was a matter of hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="425">QUESTION:  I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">ANSWER:  Just a matter of hours, because they were located with our <span class="BUILDING">division headquarters</span> , and that's where I was at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">ANSWER:  That they were brought in there and administered help to them, and this was where I got assigned a job of moving these people away from this point in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Farsleben</span> because actually this was still a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">battle zone</span> , and we had American artillery falling in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">We had German artillery falling in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">So we didn't want to have anymore casualties. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">So I was delegated then to round up transportation and take these people out of there to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hillersleben</span> that we had liberated a couple of days before where there was a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">So I rounded up about 60 or 70 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> and got them loaded up and got them out of the <span class="REGION">area</span> back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hillersleben</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And of course, the medical corps went with them, and they put the sick people in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and the others went into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , but first of all, as soon as we brought them back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hillersleben</span> , they were so dirty and stinking and filthy that there was nothing that we could do to give them clean clothing, so we had to have them strip their clothing off, and the engineer battalion set up some shower points, and we started moving them through the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> --the first <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> that they had had in months and years. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And as soon as they got through the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , of course, they were given towels and soap, and they were so happy to get cleaned up to little bit, but even through the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , they could not get rid of the lice that were infested in their hair and in their pubic hairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And so after they finished the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , we dusted them with DDT. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Now, DDT 1s today a prohibited item because it's a carcinoginious|sic] item and 1s, by law, is prohibited for use. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">But at that time that was the best technology that we had to fight lice and fleas any kind of insect that they might have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  Did it work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">ANSWER:  It worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">So then we had the German people were ordered to bring clothing to this point and of course they were reclothed, and then the single people were put in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">The married people were put in to some of the private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> that were available. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And at this point, I left them. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">They went back to my unit and continued on my job, and we fought or way onto <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> and we attacked, captured <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> on the 18th of April, and as far as we were concerned, that was the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Because the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Elm River</span> which ran through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> was the <span class="DLF">demarcation line</span> between us and the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">We could not go beyond that <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">So we stopped fighting on the 18th of April, and just sat there and wait for the Russians to come in front of us and move on into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">But basically that was the end of the war, and that was the first and only contact that we had ever had with any Jews, this group of the 2,500 on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And of course, in talking with some of them, we found out where they came from, and that they had been incarcerated at BergenBelsen, and they told us a story about their life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">BergenBelsen</span> and them being put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and then we captured them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">QUESTION:  Did they tell you about mass killings? </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Did they tell you about--
ANSWER:  Well, no because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">BergenBelsen</span> was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">killing camp</span> you might say. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where they worked 1215 hours a day, and the working conditions were not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">The food was not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Their living conditions not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">They told us about their life there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">BergenBelsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I was going to say they didn't have a large <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> or <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> or anything like that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">BergenBelsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">It was just a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camp</span> , and part of it was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">exchange camp</span> , as I mentioned before, to exchange the people for German prisoners, but they told us about the hardships they had, the life that they had, the living conditions in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> there at BergenBelsen was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">They had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , I think four high, and three or four people had to sleep in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">The living conditions were very, very bad there at BergenBelsen. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So this 1s basically the first time that we ever heard of Jews, slave labor, <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">We never heard anything like that before. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">We could hardly believe what they were telling us. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And they got a lot of this information from some of the inmates who had come <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> were being overcrowded there, and they moved them into BergenBelsen, and then those prisoners in turn were telling the others about what was going on in these other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">That's how they knew what was going on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And so, you know, we were not trained as humanitarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">We were trained as soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And basically when we saw this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and these Jews, the condition that they were in, we really didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">We did the best we could with what we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Most of it was wrong, by feeding them the food the way we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="469">QUESTION:  Did your understanding of what you were fighting for and why we you fighting change with that encounter?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">ANSWER:  Well, we weren't--as we were fighting across Europe, we weren't fighting to save any Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">We didn't know about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">We were fighting to drive the Germans back out of these <span class="REGION">occupied countries</span> , to give these people in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> --to give their freedom and liberty back that they had had back in 1940 when they were invaded by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">The Jewish situation was just sort of a sideline that happened that we didn't know anything about. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">We didn't know what was going on until we saw, and then we believed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">QUESTION:  And did that change your attitudes towards the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">ANSWER:  Well, basically at that point in time, it was too late because here we are at the end of the war now. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">So from that point on, we didn't have much contact with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">The war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I think it was the 8th of May; so it was only about three weeks after we found this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that the war ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Of course, we didn't have any good feelings toward the Germans because they were denying everything, and we knew that they were lying, that they were involved in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">They knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">They knew what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">QUESTION:  When did you hear that the war had ended, and how did you hear about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">ANSWER:  I'm sorry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">QUESTION:  When did you hear that the war was over, and how did you hear about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">ANSWER:  Well, he were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> until--basically just sitting there waiting for the Russians to come up 1n front of us, and I think we got word through our higher channels came down to us that the war had officially ended on the 8th of May. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Like I say, we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> , liberated that on the 18th of April, and we could not cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> to liberate anything more. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">We just had to sit there and wait for the Russians because that was declared to be their <span class="REGION">territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So we had to sit there from the 18th of April I think until about the 25th or 26th of April before the Russians actually moved up 1n front of us, and we met with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">So of course we knew then the Russians were allocated that <span class="REGION">territory</span> , which included the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and as soon as they moved in front of us and on up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , they captured it, that the war was going to be over very, very soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">QUESTION:  And did you meet with or interact with any of the Russians?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">ANSWER:  Yeah, we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">QUESTION:  What did you think of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">ANSWER:  They were stinking, dirty bastards. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">They were very arrogant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">QUESTION:  Did you write any letters <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to your wife about what you experienced with that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">ANSWER:  That I really don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I did write to her basically every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I'm sure that I did, but very unfortunately after I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , she had piles of these letters that I written to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">She had saved all my letters, and she returned letters wrote to me every day, which I saved and I would send them back to her, bundles of them, back to her and she saved them. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we had boxes and boxes of these letters, and what we were going to do with this stuff? </span><span class="sentence" id="502">We dumped it, and it was the worst thing I ever did because in those liters I wrote to her in sort of a coded way where I was what I was doing because all of our mail was censored because we were not allowed to tell where we were or what we were doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="503">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">ANSWER:  But in a coded way I could relate to her where I was and what I was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">So all those things were in there, and the men that I had contact with from day to day, the things that I did from day to day. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">That was a historical document, and we just threw all of that away because I know all that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I can remember all those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">But now today, I can't remember those things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">QUESTION:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">When did you get word that you were going to be sent back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="511">ANSWER:  I'm sorry again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  When did you get word that you were going to be sent back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  Oh, when we ended the war, basically the 8th of May, we moved southward about 50 miles into an area of occupation, and it was at that time we were notified that the 30th Division was prioritized to come back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and have a 15day leave and do some 30day training and go to the Pacific and help finish the war in the Pacific. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">So we were geared for that, and that was in probably in July. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">So in midearly August, we started moving back through <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in preparation to return to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , and while we were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , they dropped the bomb on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hiroshima</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nagasaki</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And that, in fact, ended the war, and we felt right then and there that we would not--have--we may have to go to the Pacific, but there would not be any war to be fought as we had planned. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">We came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and we were given a 30day leave and during that time, the Great White Fathers of Washington were mulling over what are we going to do with all these guys now. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">We don't need them anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">The war in the Pacific is over. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">So they sent telegrams to everybody telling them to report to their nearest <span class="BUILDING">military installation</span> for further orders, which they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And the most of them got their discharge, and that ended their military service.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">QUESTION:  But you stayed on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">ANSWER:  I stayed on. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">We had the opportunity to volunteer to stay in service or take a discharge, and I volunteered to stay in service, and so I reported back to the 30th Division, which was then we head quartered at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Jackson</span> in <span class="REGION">South Carolina</span> ; so I remained there for about six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I was company commander of the 5th Corps Headquarters Company, and at the end of that six months, we were given the opportunity to go to another <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in occupation duty, and we were given the opportunity to like the Caribbean, <span class="REGION">Panama area</span> , <span class="REGION">Hawaii</span> , and a few other <span class="NPIP">places</span> plus <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> and Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Well, of course <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> and Europe were at the bottom of my list and actually the Hawaii or the Caribbean were at the top of the list, and that's what I chose, but what did I get? </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I got orders to go back to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">So I went back to Europe and was stationed in Frankfurt Germany and remained there for three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Now, during that time, after I was over there for about four five months, dependants were allowed to come over and join us. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">So my wife came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , and we lived there, and that's where we had our family--I'm sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">QUESTION:  Lets back up just for a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">QUESTION:  In terms of returning to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">QUESTION:  Do you recall the first time that you saw your wife again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">ANSWER:  Oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Going back to the time we left <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> that we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on the Queen Marry, commuted to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Kilmer</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , and that's where we were given our leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Now, during the time that I was in Europe, my wife stayed with my mother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> --although her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> --she chose to say with my mother during that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">So when I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , of course I got to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , took me into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , and I got in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> to take me to my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and it was a pretty emotional reunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Of course I had sent telegrams to them and telephoned called telling them that I was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So they were aware that I was going to be there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">QUESTION:  And what was that day like? </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Do you remember it? </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Tell me about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">ANSWER:  Well, I can't really remember that very well, but I know it was very emotional. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I had not seen my wife in 11 months, and to be alive and back with her again, it was a very, very pleasant reunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And of course, my mother was there too, and to be alive was the main thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">We never knew all through the war when the silver bullet was going to hit us, and that would be the end, but I was very fortunate that I dodged the bullet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">QUESTION:  So let's go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Your wife has joined you. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">You're now starting a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">What was that experience like? </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Were your children born there in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">She came over in the--let me see--in the fall of '46, and we were given a preference of having a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And eight months later, she delivered twins in the <span class="BUILDING">97th General Hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">That was the beginning of our family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">ANSWER:  And then exactly one year later, we had a son born. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Also in the <span class="BUILDING">97th General Hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Now, although they were born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I, being an American citizen and she also--they were registered with the <span class="BUILDING">United States embassy</span> there, and they are actually American citizens, although they were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">QUESTION:  And did they--did you stay long enough for them to go <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">ANSWER:  Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">The girls were two years old, and my son was | year old, and it was then that we made a decision to terminate--my contact was coming to an end, and we decided to terminate the contact and come back to the <span class="COUNTRY">states</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="568">So in '49 we came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">states</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">QUESTION:  And where did you settle, and what did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="570">ANSWER:  Well, we came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> and lived there for a few months, and then we went down the Florida to live with her parents for a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And we decided that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> was a better location because we had just lived there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> through a winter, and it was very cold, and I got tired of shoveling snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">So we decided to settle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">QUESTION:  So what did you do in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">ANSWER:  I went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a while and studied computer work and got a job there at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Florida</span> as an office manager in the <span class="BUILDING">computing center</span> that they had at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">QUESTION:  And you've been employed ever since?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">ANSWER:  I've been here ever since. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">We built our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> here in 1950 and been right here ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">QUESTION:  Now, that experience with those people on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , that really wasn't the end of it for you, was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I never gave it much thought until--I guess in the 80s, we were cleaning out some junk in somewhere, holdings, and I came across a little notebooks that I had kept sort of a diary in. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And I had a lot of information about this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> --the encounter with that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and I just stopped to think about those days and those people, and I thought that that would be a good historical document. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And so I took all the notes that I had in those notebooks and kind of put them together in a handwritten document this was before the days of computers really, and--but a little later, when <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computers</span> --when the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> got involved with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computers</span> , I started transferring all that stuff into my computer. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Well, I had this document there and still did nothing with it, just a document for future historical purposes, but it was not until 2005 that I had the opportunity to go back the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Now, this was a little story in itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">A few years before this, I had had communication with a young girl in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> who was working at the University of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> on her Ph.</span><span class="sentence" id="586">D thesis which was on the liberation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Now, when we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> in May of 1945, this became a part of the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="588">The Russians moved into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> and they purged everything that was in the <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> and <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , archives, any documents that were in English and anything that was related to the liberation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">They instilled in the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> that they were the liberators of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And for the next 40 years, that was the belief that the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> were brought up in. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">So the young girl working on her thesis of the liberation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> writing to me indicated that the Russians claimed that they had liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> , but friend of hers had a book which said something about the Americans had liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">What is the truth? </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Now, she had found my name in the computer. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I'm not sure just how she found it, but she found my name connected with the 30th Division, and so she was asking this Q: How did the Americans really liberate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Well, of course I sent her back copies of pages from some of our history books and from my own personal knowledge about the liberation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> on the 16th of the April, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">She put this all together and wrote up her thesis, and she did get her Ph.D. but she took that document to the mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> , and he was rather surprised to know that the Americans actually had liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">He was always of the impression that the Russians had liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Now, we're coming up on April of 2005, which then was going to be the--I think the 40th or 50th anniversary of the liberation--this just happened to coincide with the 1200th anniversary of the founding of the City of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">So they were planing to have a big celebration on the anniversary of the founding of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> as well as the liberation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">So in doing so, and unknown to me at the time, they invited a man who had been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camp</span> there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Now, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> , there was a pulte ammunition works which was making ammunition for the German war machine, and this was operated by slave laborers, Jewish slave laborers, which had come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And we, the 30th Division, had actually liberated this slave labor camp, and that was in a matter of a few days after we had liberated the Farsleben group. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Anyway, the mayor, through another person, invited this man who--this Jew who had been a slave laborer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> in the pulte ammunition works to come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> to tell the people about his incarceration. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">At the same time he invited me to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> to tell the people about the actual liberation by the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">So for the first time, when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> , I met this man, the man who--the Jew that I had liberated in 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">So we worked up a nice relationship, and I found that he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boca Raton</span> , <span class="REGION">Florida</span> , about three hours away from where I lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">So this was a fascinating thing that I, a liberator, and he, a Jewish slave laborer, should end up living so close together here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="608">QUESTION:  And have you been in communication with him since?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="609">ANSWER:  I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">He just died about a month ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Anyway, after we came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> , he sent me an email saying, "Frank, look at this web site. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">It 1s tremendous." </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And I opened up the <span class="BUILDING">web site</span> , and it was a web site created by a history teacher up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hudson Falls</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and it was about a tank commander of the 743rd Tank Battalion having liberated a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Magdeburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Well, I read the whole story through, and it was exactly the story that I related to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And how did this guy get this story? </span><span class="sentence" id="617">So I got in contact with this teacher to find out what his relationship was to this web site and story. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And it seems that he was a World War II history buff, but he was at the time concentrating on the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And he gave his class a project to go out in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and see if you can contact a veteran who had anything to do with his connection with the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">The students brought their stories in, and read them. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">They discussed them, but there was one boy who had a very unique story--that his grandfather was a tank commander in the 743rd Tank Battalion, and they had captured this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with 2,500 Jews on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Well, that's exactly my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">So I got together with this teacher and we discussed his side of it, and I told him my connection with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And so we've been sort of collaborating together ever since. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Now, at the time, he put his web site out he got in--his story went out on the Internet, and the first hit that he had on it was from a lady in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Now, she was a young girl on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and her family moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> at that time, and of course she's been there ever since, and she saw that web site, and she got back in contact with the teacher, and through that--and then he had two or three other hits up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="627">So when I was discussing this matter with him, he had probably about 10 or 12 Jews that he had had contact with who were on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Well, I said, you know, I've got this story about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and want to get involved in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">So I went on the Internet and put my story out, and I started getting hits on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And it just snowballed, and eventually I got in contact with a person in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> who had been a young boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">He had been <span class="BUILDING">orphaned</span> , and went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> --or went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and was adopted by a family, was educated there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , and he became a doctor, a medical doctor and had practiced and just retired when I first got in contact with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">He could not speak very good English, and it was very difficult for me to understand him, but his daughter was quite interested, and she could speak much better English than he could; although it was kind of broken up. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">So she became very interested in his story because, as with many of these Jews, as they grew up, they wanted to forget the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">They wanted to forget about the Holocaust and not even talk about it to their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">So she was interested in it, and she wanted to hear more about it, wanted to learn what her father had been through. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">So I gave her the whole story as I could recall, and she became very much involved in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And her father originally was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , he was Hungarian, and he remembered the names of some of the people, and she started researching there in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for some of those people, and she found a number of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">So this increased our numbers of people who had survived this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Now, going back just a bit on this--on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> originally, there was about 2,500 people, and of them, there were about 600 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Now, I say children. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">These are people 21 years of age and less.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="643">ANSWER:  Now, the Germans were quite meticulous about keeping records. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">When that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> left BergenBelsen, and we captured it there at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Farsleben</span> , the train commander had a list of all the people that were on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="645">That list contained their name, their birth date, and their birthplace, and of course other data too that was not really relevant. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">That document was taken and retained by what is now the BergenBelsen Memorial, and I got a copy of that list and went through it and since it had the birth date of everybody that was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I could determine who the children were. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">So I sorted out all the children in the 600 names, and of those--I just assumed half of them were deceased because of malnutrition, age, and other causes. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">So we're down to about the possibility of 300plus surviving children out there somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">So with this young lady in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> doing some research and finding some of these people and some of my research through the Internet, I have found 235 of these people, and I've been in contact with each one either by mail physical (phone interference)
QUESTION:  Can you say that last part again? </span><span class="sentence" id="650">We had a trifle bit of audio difficulty, I lost you at you were contacting them by email.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">ANSWER:  Either by email or snail mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="652">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And how many did you contact?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">ANSWER:  I've contacted 235.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">QUESTION:  And they--did most of them respond to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">ANSWER:  I'm sorry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">QUESTION:  Did most of them respond to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">In fact, I'm in contact with them right now trying to get any kind of documents, copies of documents, that they might have. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Now, I need to go back here just a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">At the time of the liberation, these people I'm talking about today, they were all young kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="663">ANSWER:  21 years and less. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Those who were ten years and younger, they really don't remember much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">ANSWER:  It's the group that's 10 to 21 they have a little memory of what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Prior to the war, their parents could see the handwriting on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , what was happening to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And they were starting to make arrangements to get out of Europe to get away from Hitler and the program that he had to eliminate the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">So many of them had obtained passports from various <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> wherever they would be accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Now, in those years, there was a great deal of antiSemitism that <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> did not want these Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">They had a very, very limited quota, and that's all they would take in here. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">So these people got passports to <span class="REGION">South American countries</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , <span class="REGION">African countries</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Some got passports to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">So whatever <span class="NPIP">place</span> these people had passports for, that's where they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">They went--they scattered all over the world because they were citizens of that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="677">ANSWER:  And we at the time of the liberation furnished transportation to them to whatever <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> they had a passport for. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Now, just last night, I was talking with a girl--lady in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , by Skype, and she said she had just found two more girls or ladies in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">So that is the way this thing snowballed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">ANSWER:  So I got two more people that I've got to start researching in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">But we had a lot of them come here to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> too, but must of them are settled up in around the <span class="REGION">New York area</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">ANSWER:  There's very few here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> , and there's a group up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carolina</span> and a few out in <span class="REGION">California</span> , and they're just scattered all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">So two years ago, this young lady in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> thought it would be a nice idea to have a reunion of some of these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">So we--she sent word out to them, and I sent word out to the people in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> about a reunion that they wanted to have in April--two and a half years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">So we have this reunion 1n her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rehovot</span> , which is between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And we had 60 of the survivors plus their children and grandchildren--total about 500 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And we assembled at the <span class="BUILDING">Weizmann Institute</span> there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rehovot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">They had a large <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span> in which we met.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">QUESTION:  What was that like seeing them again now as grown people who had made lives
ANSWER:  It was very emotional to meet these people that I had had a little hand in liberating 6569 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And they were very receptive and very thankful to me to be one of their liberators, and in fact I have been the only liberator that they had ever met. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And it was a very emotional meeting to be with these people, to physically see some of those people, and the thing is the most of them had never met each other before because they came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , staggered, at different times by different routes, and ended up in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Some went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , some whet the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , and all the little kibbutz's all over <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> --<span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  And so they were really never had any contact with each other, and this was the first time that they had contact with each other as well as me, as a liberator. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">Now, the most of these survivors had never talked about the Holocaust to their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">As they grew up, they just wanted to forget the bad memories there--that they just wanted to forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">The day of their liberation, that was the day of a new life for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Anything before that, they just wanted to forget about it and not talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">The children would ask them, you know, what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="702">I don't want to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And we'll talk about something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And this was going on for years until this reunion time--that I told the story--the one that I more or less had related to you now to these children, and they are learning for the first time what happened to their parents, a little bit about the BergenBelsen era, but mostly from the actual liberation period, which they knew nothing about. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">All they knew was what their parents had told them from the time they grew up in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or wherever they were up until the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">ANSWER:  So this was a whole new story for these children and grandchildren to learn about something about the liberation of their people. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Now, what one person in particular, girl named lily, she was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and she had lost both of her parents to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and as an orphan, she was being taken care of by various other women. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And she lived through BergenBelsen with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And on the day of their liberation, the 13th of April, she said, "That is my birthday." </span><span class="sentence" id="712">She did not now exactly where she was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">She did not know exactly when she was born, so she took that day of liberation, the 13th of April, 1945, as her birth date, and she has considered that her birth date ever since. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">This is one example of their feeling toward their liberation--that they feel that day of liberation was a very prominent and famous day as far as they were concerned--the beginning of their life. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And so many of them have told me that their life began on the 13th of April, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Anything before that never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">They just wanted to forget it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">QUESTION:  There are those who would say and those who do say that the Holocaust never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">What would you say to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">ANSWER:  You should have been there. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">If you'd have seen it and smelled it, you'd believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">That's all I can tell them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">QUESTION:  Well, sir, it was an outstanding interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Thank you for your time and for your story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="727">ANSWER:  Thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">It has been a pleasure for me to do this and to contact these people and get their information and be able to relate that with others. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Now, I must add on here that our 30th infantry division has annual reunions, and I think it was about five years ago we had a reunion at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fayetteville</span> , and we invited as many as would come of these survivors, and we had I think it was eight came to our reunion in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fayetteville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="730">So we--we're working up a close relationship with these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">In fact, we just had a reunion in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Savannah</span> two weeks ago, and we had four of them come. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Unfortunately, this was during the storm period up in the north, and several had planned to come were unable to join with us, but we did have one come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> --him and his wife flew over, got here just before the storm hit, and was able to get into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Savannah</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And I think it was last year or the year before, we had two people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> come and join just for this purpose, to join with their liberators and some others of their surviving peers. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">So we're working up a close relationship with these people today. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Yup.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">QUESTION:  Very good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">So I'm working on this project now and trying to get in contact with the two new people down in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> .</span></p>
