<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you please tell me your name, how you were born, your birth name, and when and where you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Bertna Belle Pasternak. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Now, my name is Bernard. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">It went from Belle to Bernard. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I was born in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">It was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Martimorish</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="6">It's in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Visho</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Visho</span> , when <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> was there it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vishosimos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And also, they called that city Feldesisho because the Hungarians were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">The <span class="REGION">area</span> where I was born was surrounded with <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> around. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">We had high peaks of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> over there which there was snow almost all year around. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">About September the snow melted, something like this and then a month later the snow came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">The <span class="REGION">area</span> was a beautiful <span class="REGION">area</span> surrounded with water. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">We had water. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">We had everything over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">We were there, approximately a few thousand Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">There was a few thousand Germans and also a few thousands Rumanians and Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">We all had <span class="REGION">areas</span> , different <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">The Jews had their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">The Rumanians the other <span class="NPIP">quarter</span> , the Germans the other <span class="NPIP">quarter</span> and the Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">The Germans were not the same type of Germans as in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">They all speak German, but they call them Sipser (ph), a Shwab, some kind of a Shwab name. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">There was a lot of them, and we all understand each other and we got along great. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , in the Visho, as a matter of fact, the Jewish life was so great over there that on Friday, we had a whistle blowing when the Shobot comes, three times. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">The first whistle meant close the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The second whistle meant you should be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by now, and the third one to light candles. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">That was the greatest thing to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">We also had a there which children were coming from all around learning and that by us. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">We had five <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">They named them number one, number three, number four and five. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">We also had about four or five <span class="BUILDING">shulls</span> , and we all belonged to different <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Everybody had a different way to go wherever he wanted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">We were assigned to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> number one which it was I would say about a half a mile. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">The <span class="REGION">area</span> there -- there was no transportation like you have over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">We walked to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> wasn't so bad to walk except there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> when you got to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Also there was another system too over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">We went to Hebrew in the morning until 9:30, from 7:00 until about 9:30. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">At 9:30 we went to the <span class="BUILDING">Romanian school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We had lunch a little bit, about a half an hour, and then in the afternoon until 4:00. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">4:00 we went back to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> until about 8:00. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Now, what did we do over there all this time, you know, with the children when they're grown up? </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Industrial life, there was only how should I say, <span class="BUILDING">wood factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">We had a lot of wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">All the time, when the Hungarians were before the First World War, and the Austrian life was very beautiful over there, very great. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">On the beginning on the 18th century, the beginning of the 18th century, the first Jew came over from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">He settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Martimorish</span> because there wasn't such a good life there so they kept on coming and coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">They settled. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">But after the Romanians took over, after the first world war, the Romanians took over and life turned sour because the Rumanians didn't need any wood and there was no other industry so it wasn't so great for everybody over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Their lives started to be very poor, but what we grew over there and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , there was potatoes, beans, corns, so almost everybody had a little <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">We stored away the food for the wintertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">We put it in <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> , whoever had <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> and we kept on going day by day. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We had no telephone of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">We had no radios and things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">It was like in the early 1900 century. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">It didn't change much, the life. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">There was a lot of poor people in the <span class="REGION">area</span> also because I came from a five sisters and two brothers, but most of the families were much larger, and it was not easy to keep up so many people to feed the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">The father only had the work over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">The mothers over there, like the Jewish mothers, they always took care of their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">They were trying to do the best they can to see that everybody is nourished the right way and lived the right way. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But there were other kinds of things over there, the life was very harsh, the way it happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">It started with beatings. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">No matter what you do, you got a beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">You went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hadre</span> , you didn't know the thing, you got a beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">You walked in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , if there was an older man and you didn't give him the right of way, he give you a beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">You went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which the principal from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , his name was Hugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">He was standing in the <span class="DLF">steps</span> just wait for children to come in and he pulled their hair so much until the kid collapsed. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Then we went in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We sit down, there must be a least 300 children approximately. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Now, the teacher came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">When the teacher came in, you could drop a pin, and it was so quiet nobody made a move. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">The teacher walked around and they didn't like any child or whatever it is, you got a beating. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So, that's the way life was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Unfortunately I was a lefty, and I could not write with my right hand because I was a lefty. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So, the teacher was watching most of the people who were lefties. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">She had a big stick, I would say at least one inch thick, short stick. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">When I had to write, I grabbed the pencil with the left hand, and I wanted to do what I have to do from the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">When the teacher noticed, she came over with that stick and it almost broke my arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">But there was no other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I had to learn how to write with my right hand, which by the way away now, I do write with my right hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">It's the same thing with the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">If you're a lefty, of course you take the spoon and start eating with your left hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">You got a beating that time, too, because you're supposed to eat with your right hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Everything came out with force just to do with the right hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">When I grow up a little bit bigger, I went to learn at a tin smith and he only had to shear with right hand shears. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I had to learn how to cut with my right hand because there was no left hand shears. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Like I was saying, life was going on with the Romanians, I was working during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Whenever I had time, sometimes in between sometimes I was working, helped out a little bit until 1940 when the Hungarians came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">The Romanians went out and the Hungarians came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Once the Hungarians came in, the old timers used to tell us how good it was by the Hungarians before the World War so we should be happy that the Hungarians came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Life would be different. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">What happened, there was a few soldiers, Jewish soldiers and they came over to us and they said this is not the same Hungarians that the older people know. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">This is a different type of Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">In the beginning it was not too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">A year or two or something, it was not too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">By the way, in schooling, in the thirties, the late thirties, there was a Romanian, there was a party, an anti-Semitic party. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Koozar was the name of the minister and the Prime Minster was Googar. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Koozer and Googar. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">In the late thirties they came in to make the pogroms, and we were so worried they were going to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Visho</span> because we know they're coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Visho</span> to make the pogrom. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">What happened when it came to the <span class="REGION">area</span> , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Visho</span> left, they turned right and they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">They burned the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">They killed a lot of people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They destroyed everything over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">That was in the late thirties. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">At that time, the anti- semitic thing was so big, all the things were so big, that I couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">All my schooling was four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I could not go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> any more due to the fact that I was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">My parents whatever they could they give us a little private lesson, whatever we could just to keep up the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">My father was a singer on the weddings. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">He was also a canter, and he was one of the greatest men from the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">They used to call him all around the <span class="REGION">area</span> for states to sing and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">He used to put words together. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">If he would have been here in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> he would be the greatest man in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as a singer. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So, it was very hard to even keep up with the families so he also had a job -- like we had horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , which almost everybody had that thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">We had a little <span class="DLF">farm</span> there to try and grow some food things like that, but life was very hard, very hard life. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">When the Hungarians were in already for a few years, then we saw the true colors from the Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">First of all, they put us, we have to give a day's work, everybody has to give a free day's work. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So, I went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I give them a day's work, so the thing of it is you could have worked for somebody else too, if they pay you, you could work for somebody else too. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So, I worked five days a week so we didn't feel like going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">The people who had <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> think like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I used to get paid and go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">What was the work? </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Most of the work was preparation for the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We went out to work on the volleys. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">We dig big <span class="DLF">holes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">We put <span class="DLF">trenches</span> around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> should not come through. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian tanks</span> should not be able to come through the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So, we worked day in and day out. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">After the Hungarians decided why should there be one day where everybody goes to work, so they put us to working more days. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So, really we had the most miserable life of the Hungarians for the past few years. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">They took away everything whatever we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">If somebody had a cow, they took it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">If they had a horse, they took it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">They left you flat with everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">The <span class="REGION">area</span> where I was with all the people who we got along so great all those years, they looked the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I don't think there was one person who survived over there that somebody should hide that person. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">There was not such a thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  This was from what period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  That was the period since the Hungarians came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I would say from 1942 to 1944, because the first, in the beginning it was not too bad with the Hungarians, like I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">They needed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> and there was a <span class="BUILDING">wood factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I worked in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> where they sawed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> and we cleaned off, you know around the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> they had that black thing around the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> , we chopped it off to clean the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> to be able to bring 1t down to prepare if for wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So, it was a very hard life. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">We got paid very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">We got paid -- talking about child labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">You were 15, 16 and you put in eight, ten, twelve hours a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">It was the same thing with almost with everybody had to go through the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  I'm going to ask you now to tell me before the forming of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , tell me how much your family knew about what was going on with the war and with Jews in other parts of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Did they know what was happening? </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Did they know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="152">A. After, I would say in '43, we already it got very, very bad in general. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Very bad for everybody for every Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">If a Hungarian soldier passed on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , the first thing he called over a Jew and he hit them. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">No reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">He went to the horses, they were riding horses, he would beat them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Then later on, we heard something, that something 1s going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">There was something, a daughter-in-law was from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and she wrote a letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">She was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and her husband was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Visho</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">They couldn't get together because the war started already. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So, she wrote a letter and it was censored so bad, that he couldn't write anything what's going on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So, I will never forget this woman was a rabbi's daughter-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So, she wrote for her husband and which I said for the rabbi, she wrote in the letter we should know what's going on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">She wrote like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">There is that means money, is no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">It doesn't exit any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So we know from that two words we started to figure out what's going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">There was no radio or any other communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">We didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Later on, the situation got very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">We heard, first of all before the state came, they called to the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">They were calling all the Jewish children who were at age at that time, who were 17, 18 19 to go to the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">In the Army they used those Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">They used them to bring ammunition to the <span class="DLF">front line</span> to do all kind of work for the Hungarian Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">The Army -- they had uniformed Army, they had yellow around the arms -- armband, yellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">This way they recognized them as Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">There was also another group where they had white arm bands. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">That means they were not pure Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">The mother was Jewish or the father was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So, they had two type of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I did not go -- I'm supposed to go to the Army at that time, my father says to me, you don't have to go, let's go together because we don't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">He also told me something -- he told me it looks like something is going on terrible in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I don't think you're going to be a Hungarian soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I think you are going to be some other <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Then, we all got together. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">They called us. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">How did they get the people together? </span><span class="sentence" id="188">There were drums. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">If you know when sometimes they have a drum and they bang on the drum and they got the people together, that was a sign that the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to get together because there is some news to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Then they tell us that everybody there's going to be a round up and they have to go in this and this <span class="REGION">area</span> like but us on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">There was the <span class="DLF">Jewish street</span> and they started making the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">The <span class="DLF">Jewish street</span> over there and the <span class="DLF">Romanian street</span> 's name was , the number was 25. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">The Hungarian name was 32. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So, the reason is because I tell you this is because when they got us all together they told us which <span class="DLF">street</span> to get in together. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So this was the word the guy was using to get us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And the same thing they got all around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> all around the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and they got all these people together and they bring them in and that's <span class="DLF">street</span> around the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">We had so many people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where to sleep or where to go or what to do anything because one was on top of the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">The time wasn't too long in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">We was about a month in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">They were-- who was watching the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was the Hungarians and the Germans, the local people was watching in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">The food was very scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">There was no food in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">My father used to know all those big shots in there from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and he used to help a lot of people out. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">If they were having a problem, he used to help them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">He used to go there, so he went over to one of those guards and he said, "look we are all together in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Those people they had <span class="DLF">farms</span> - the Jewish people and they put away their food for the winter time. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">They have them in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Let's bring it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Let's feed them otherwise it's going to rot away anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And so how some way my father convinced them and we started bringing in all the food from around. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I got permission to go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and I went out of course I bring back the food so there was also other people they brought in the food and it started to get a little bit better. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Mostly what we brought in was potatoes, things like this because corn there was a lot of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Then I saw a little later on I saw German soldiers began in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">They were already probably got their orders to round us out and start shipping out. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">They put us in the <span class="DLF">line</span> , find out how many people there are and they made four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">My father was -- when they round them up, when the German soldier passed, he give him some kind of a salute, so the guy looked at him and he asked him, he said, "Are you a military man?" </span><span class="sentence" id="217">He said, "Yes I am, this and this front and I am an officer.” </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Do you have a -- well, he didn't do anything he just bypassed and to find out that information. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">They made like I said four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">We had two <span class="BUILDING">stations train stations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">One <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> they called it the small <span class="BUILDING">station</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> used to stop and drop off people, and the one <span class="BUILDING">station</span> was a bigger <span class="BUILDING">station</span> where the railroad came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I also want to say that before all those things, I worked for the Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">We took apart the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> , the <span class="DLF">Romanian tracks</span> , you know from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and we send them into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So, I was loading and unloading the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">There was two Hungarian officers and they are not supposed to hire Jewish children for the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">When I went in there and applied for the job, he asked me the name, he asked me what your name, I said Bernard Pasternak. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">He said that sounds too Jewish, so he changed my name for Pasteronish. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">That's a real Hungarian name, and I got the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">They paid very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">We had it very good for a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">The job only lasted for a few months because there wasn't so many <span class="DLF">tracks</span> to pick apart and we loaded them. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">We did not load them in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Visho</span> from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , we had to go about 50 miles away where they loaded those <span class="DLF">tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">So we went with the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and we unloaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">That was before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and all those things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">We -- due to the fact they were short on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> , so they made four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> and we were going on the fourth <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">When they got together everybody, they told them don't take anything, just take what you could take with you because you have on other things over there and you wouldn't need them. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">To that point, we didn't know what was going on -- absolutely nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">As a matter of fact, they told us we were going to working <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> until the war is over for security reasons or whatever they want. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">We arrived with the fourth <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">With the other three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> , I mean it was about two days apart, so the other three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> left. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">When we got to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , I saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box car</span> and we saw all those things what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">People on there with small children crying throwing packets down on the Hungarian soldiers and the collaborators pulling the bags out of the family they are taking away everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They didn't need it anyhow, but we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">So finally, we went in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I don't know, probably must have been 20 or 30 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">We went in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">He push you in, maybe seventy, eighty people. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">You can't tell how many you have with children, older ladies and things like this, and then they close the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they locked it with a lock on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">The only air you had in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> was if you see a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> , the ones you see in the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> was the same one they were taking away. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">All you could see is the same thing you see there. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">First we were going for about a day or so and then they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> for everybody and says there is water in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> here because those days all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were going with water, so they had to pump in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So, they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they were watching us like the biggest criminals with guns and says only one to leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and go fill up with water for the rest of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">It happened I was the one and my father was the one. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">We tried to supply water, whatever we could to the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , and then my father saw a <span class="DLF">hatch</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> , because every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> had a <span class="DLF">hatch</span> probably for the . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">He took that so nobody should see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">We finish with the water, then close the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> and we started going. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Then my father called my over and said, "Let's dig a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Let's break the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> there to make a <span class="BUILDING">facility</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="259">We worked quite a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">It was very dark and we carted through and we made a <span class="BUILDING">facility</span> there to go out like a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Everybody was using this. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">We were putting something around there so people would have a little privacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">It took quite a few days before we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but the middle of the way there was a few guys in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> they told me, if you could pay attention, are we turning left or right and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I says to the guy, no we are turning left, he says that's bad news because right is to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , left 1s to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">It's the one other <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I don't remember if it took five days or six days. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">When we got off in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , first of all in that time when I was taking the water there was a couple of dead children already, which I took them out and there was somebody going through with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and I put them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> because there was a lot of sick children already and they caught already. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Nothing in there was no food, no nothing, very little things whatever we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , like my mother will know something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">QUESTION:  I want to ask you some questions about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  All right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  Who gave you permission to leave, or did you sneak out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">You couldn't sneak out because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was surrounded by corroborators to make sure nobody was out. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And besides that, which I did not mention, you already had the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">You had the yellow star, and if they caught you without wearing the yellow star you were finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">So, right away they know you. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And I think all the things that my father knew so many of those guys and they hand picked a few of the people to go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> to bring in the stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">It wasn't -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> was quite a ride, maybe thirty, forty miles in some <span class="REGION">area</span> until we got all the food together and brought it in in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Like I was saying, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , my mother put her hands around and squeezed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">She said, "I hope you remember me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I did not know what she meant because we were so naive we didn't know what's going on until the last minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">When we got off of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , first what I saw it was sickening just to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> had the only one facility from all the 40 or 50 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">They opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , all the dirt came out when they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">People were half to the waist with that dirt around from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because there was no other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">You had to go from so many days. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Only one time I remember they opened for water and after that they did not open for water. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were going so fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Usually in those days a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> those days was going about 30 miles an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">You couldn't go any more because you had to put the water in, the coal, all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">It took a very long time for those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> until they reached the destination. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">But when we went in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were going so fast, my God, it must have been 60 or 70 miles an hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">We thought the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is going to flap over, things like this, because he was carrying animals in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">What difference does it make what happened to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Now, when we arrived already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , there was a lot of people over there came to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">People were already in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="298">They came over and they say, if you have small child, give it to an older lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So, my sister said to the guy, I have a small child and my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">He said, "Give it to your mother.” </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So, I had a little sister and my mother and of course my nephew, they went with my mother on the one <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">They looked, I saw a guy over there was looking and he put his hand out and he make like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">After I find out there was . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I didn't even know who that is. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">After I find out that that was the guy who did all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">He selected them. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I was very worried because the younger one they put them all with the older people so I was pretty worried because I see what they're doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I said something is going on because they are selecting the older people and the younger ones and the other ones they left go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">They put them in another <span class="NPIP">area</span> for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">So, finally I was dressed, you know, at that time we had clothes from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , people had so much clothes, so I had some kind of a coat at that time and I put a coat on and I looked a little older and I was sent on the side where they send the people to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">That's what happened after. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And that time there is other guys they came over and they says to us, "Do you see over there, the smoke over there?" </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And I said yes, what's going on over there? </span><span class="sentence" id="314">What are they doing there? </span><span class="sentence" id="315">He says, "They're burning people there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I said, burning people? </span><span class="sentence" id="317">He said yes, they call it a <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> and they're burning people over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Then he said to me do you see all those people they are going over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">This is the people who were there already. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">We went from there, we went in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">First, we had to take the clothes off and throw it in the corner there. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I took my coat and I throw it in the corner there. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I figure it's going to be over soon and I'll take my coat back. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">It never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So, then we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">We went in the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> where they told the people what to do, where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">We were lined up over there, and they first of all the guy who commanded the whole thing came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">He made an appeal, an appeal they call it, to see how many people he has in his jurisdiction. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Then another guy came over and he says, I was with my father, near my father at that time, he came over and he said is there here any mechanics, any electricians. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I was a tin smith and mechanic right away I want to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">The other people said good for you you're going to be a mechanic and you're going to do better than we were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">My father says to me why go over. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Let's be all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Let's go together. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">The people in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> they were saying, why don't you let him go as a mechanic. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Why -- suppose we go in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">We could see already what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Let him go over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So finally my father says okay, go ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">We went to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the camp there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">The whole thing was only a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">We went to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and then all those mechanics they had we got round up and we were taking by big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">We did not know at that time they took us to . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">We figured there 1s the mechanics thing and there we were going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">We arrived in . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">There was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> over there already prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">You got your <span class="NPIP">place</span> over there and everything and then we find out we're going to work in a <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">That's what they did with all of the mechanics. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">They put us in the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">The next day we went already to work which they were putting it --- there was three shifts. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">There was a morning shift, a noon shift and a night shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">We went to the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> there and there was two types of <span class="DLF">mines</span> in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">First one was about 1,000 feet and one was about 1500 or 1600 feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I was working in the lower one, about 1500 feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">We came down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">They give you a light. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">They give you a light to go to be able to see because it's so dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">They gave me a lantern. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">The number was 4400. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Also, when I go back, when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> the time before I went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> they give me they tattoo it, I got a tattoo in my arm because most of the people they sent to work they put a tattoo in my arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I got the tattoo and I was so naive at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I was there with my cousin and we still didn't know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">I saw they give numbers and I saw some people get smaller number and bigger number and I went to where they give a bigger number. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Because we were naive we said let's have a bigger number. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">What they did to my cousin, I got 84 whatever I got number and he got a number after mine and something went wrong there and they put his head in a drum of water and they drowned him and he died on the spot over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">You never lasted more than a day over there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Then when we were going back, we went down to the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> --
QUESTION:  Wait, let's go back once more. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">When you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and you were going through registration, you were still with your father in registration, and did you know what had happened to your mother then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  No, we did not know what happened to my mother until after I find out a few days later. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Even they pointed out to us, we could not believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Then some people were talking about the people and who worked in the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , they call it the . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">They were saying to me, that's the living in that <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> over there, they have everything over there because they are doing such a special job. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Well, we did not know after a while they got rid of the and took new people. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">We didn't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Then we find out after what happened and who the was and what they did after a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">With my father, I was there after the first <span class="DLF">line</span> up, the first appeal after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Then, I went to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> was and my father wasn't at that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and I never heard from him after. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I never heard what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">We went down in the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> , like I said, my lantern was 4400 and we were working with civilian Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">The light --my light had a red stripe around and the civilian had white. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">We also to recognize us, in the center of the hat there was a cut in straight, this way they recognize you right away in case you run away someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">They put me to work in the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> , which I never heard of a <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I never saw a <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">A <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> is this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">The one I was it was approximately four or five feet high. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">That doesn't mean there's coal in the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">The coal is only about two feet in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">In order to get the coal out, you have to have some kind of supporters to hold up, to be able to take the coal out. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">They dynamite the coal and if you wouldn't have had supporters, the whole thing would fall down. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">So, you had to have special supporters to hold up and then to dig the coal out to get the coal out. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Once we got the coal out from there, you took it out with a shovel and there was something not far from where you throw the shovel there, it was something, it was going up and down, five inches up, five inches down, you know it was shaking until the coal went down, because it was a little down hill over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">There was one day when they come to inspect it looks like the Germans didn't get enough coal and they came to inspect the <span class="DLF">mines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">What happened how come there is no more coming out. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I saw some people from far away, but I didn't pay much attention who they are, but they did look to me like they're civilians, Polish civilians, work in the <span class="DLF">mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">They come around and they stop everybody over there who were working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Some of them they said report to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , which I never saw those people again anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">So they took them off the <span class="DLF">line</span> and they got new people. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Then I was told they eliminated them because they didn't do the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Somehow, for some reason I don't know I always worked very hard all my life and I saw there is no way out. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">You really have to work if you want to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So, I picked up work, kept on working the right way and they come around, the inspectors, the Nazi inspector, they came around and they checked me out, how I worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Then the guy asked me, what is your number. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I showed him my tattoo and so the other guy says to me, you know you're going to have a lot of problems because they took your number down like the other guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">No, it was the other way around, believe it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">They gave me a premium of a bottle of wine because I was a good worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I took the bottle of wine and turned it in for a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I gave it to one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span> <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">They gave me a piece of bread for it, which I wouldn't drink it anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Also, for the good workers, they also give two cigarettes a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I also turned in my

class="sentence" id="412">There was quite a few prisoners of war, Russian prisoners of war, and most of them they give away the cigarettes for the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">What did we eat when going into the <span class="DLF">mine</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="414">In the morning, we had black coffee with a little piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Of course there was no lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Lunch you were at the mercy of the civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">If you find a good civilian there, he'd throw you a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">If you find a civilian who didn't have or he didn't care, you were there with bread, without a little piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Somehow, someway I managed to recognize the guys a little bit, I always had a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">We were working until 6:00 at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">From 8:00 in the morning until about 6:00 at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Like I was saying, there was a morning and a noon shift and a night shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">The night shift, the people who brought the SS who escorted the morning shift had to take back the noon shift from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="425">They always took back a shift because we didn't walk back to the camp without a Nazi guard, which I would say it was a 15, 20 minute to half hour walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">At night they had to take us back, they brought another shift and they had to take us back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="428">We had something to finish and those Germans did not wait for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">We were sitting in that <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> until the next evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">No food, absolutely no food, no nothing, only the mercy, whatever the civilian throw you a piece of bread of things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I also, on Sunday we did not work. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">We worked six days a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">On Sunday I also volunteer to clean the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> a little bit for that I got another little soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I always tried to manage somehow to get a little more. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">When we went in the <span

class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they give me another little piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So, I was trying to look around to see how I should be able to get a little bit more than I could get.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  When you were working in the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> , if you missed the SS going back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and you spent the whole night in the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> , were there guards there that you couldn't have left a night, you were locked in the <span class="DLF">coal mines</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Did you work if you got stuck there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">ANSWER:  No, you did not work when you got stuck there and you couldn't leave the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> because you had 1500 feet to go up by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lift</span> took you down, so you couldn't leave anyhow and there was guards over there and a lot of corroborators. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">You couldn't go no <span class="NPIP">place</span> and you had to stay right in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">It was pretty cool too, it was July, August and it was pretty cool. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">There was horses and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">There was little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> not with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , you pushed it by hand the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">There was a lot of things going on in that <span class="DLF">mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">When you came out of that <span class="DLF">mine</span> , you know it almost blinded you. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I had to keep my hand for a few minutes on my eyes because down in the <span class="DLF">mine</span> , I saw very well like it was daylight, once you get used to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Then when you came out, you have to be prepared otherwise you would lose your eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">When we went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , like I said, you have to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> every night. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">The <span class="NPIP">place</span> , I would describe it, 1t wasn't a dirty <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Really, they kept it very clean and we were forced to keep it clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">In the morning when we get up, we had to make our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">It was a three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk bed</span> and when you make the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> the one was helping the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">If there was a little bit uneven they came they take it apart and you have to go all over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Sometimes you couldn't even mix a little piece of bread with coffee, black coffee, because you had to make sure the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> is all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">When we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we took a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there was also other people who did not work in the <span class="DLF">coal mines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">They called them . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">That means they were working <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">We were getting different soap than the was getting. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">They got a little piece of white soap, and we got a piece of yellow soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">The white soap did not take off the dirt, the coal dirt, because when we came out from there we were black, coal black. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">We were --for two or three days we were spitting black. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">So, this yellow soap was very good soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">It did the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">It cleaned everything off. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Somehow, we got together with some people over there and we saw that piece of yellow soap, I would describe it 1t was about four by three inches and maybe one inch thick. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Four by three approximately. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And that soap was written a R-I-F. We didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">We always said one to the other one give me RIF soap, give me a piece of RIF because it's better. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">You also had to be careful because they only give you a certain time, they give you the soap it should last you a certain time, but when you bend down, you know, sometimes they stole the piece of soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">That soap, the civilian used to buy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">You know, you could put it in the pocket and bring it out, you got an extra piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">So, you had to be very careful it shouldn't be stolen. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">But later on, I was told that the R-I-F meant fat, pure Jewish fat. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">That was what I was told.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">QUESTION:  Who told you that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">ANSWER:  The people who were watching in there in the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">They told us that at the end already. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Now, the situation, in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in there by the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> in . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">The situation when we were not working on Sundays, we had three meals a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">In the morning, like I said, we had a piece of bread and coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Lunch we had a little soup, no bread, and in the evening we had soup and a piece of bread when we came from the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">If you knew a kapo, like I was carrying his lamp and things like this, so he couldn't do much for me, the only one thing when he dig in the spoon to put it in my plate, the food, it was full to the top so I already got awarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I had a little more food in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Once in a while there was some kind of a piece of a meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I don't think it weighed a tenth of one ounce. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">So, sometimes I take two pieces of that thing because I was carrying the light. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">We had a lot of shooting around the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">We had a lot of bombs dropping in there and then we figured something is going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">We saw a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> coming around, flying over. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">We saw a lot of captured pilots when we looked out of the thing, they brought them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Then we know something is going on.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="603">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I don't think my mother knew but I think my father had a very good idea of what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">It's a possibility he was told from his friends what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">He didn't pass it on. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I could just tell you one more time. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">My father was one of the greatest man there was in that <span class="REGION">area</span> with his knowledge and smarting. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I don't think there was a second man. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Anyone had a problem or something, they used to go to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">He spoke perfect Hungarian at that time, which he was in the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">He was an officer in the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Then, it looks like the Germans find out in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that he was an officer in their Army in World War I. They sent him to ; was like a model of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> they said in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">He was there with a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">He was a druggist. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">So, between both of them, the friend who was a druggist which my father know about horses, they became a veteran doctor for the German horses in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="617">It wasn't too bad until about a month before, which we keep the , that's the day when he dies is the first day of after Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">The first day after Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Why do we know? </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Because people who liberated from there they told us exactly all those things which I tell you now. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">How did he die? </span><span class="sentence" id="622">The bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">There was such a tremendous bombing at that time and he got killed with the bombs because probably they wanted to wipe out Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">They had a lot of military things in there and they wiped him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">He was going to work, and other ones were going to work, so they all got killed, one month before the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">That's why we know exactly that date. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">We keep that date and time. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">We have the tablets from his memorial thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">We have it in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">There's a rabbi . </span><span class="sentence" id="631">We grew up together. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">We helped him build the <span class="BUILDING">schull</span> over there and we put all the memorial tablets in his <span class="BUILDING">schull</span> at .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">QUESTION:  Let's now, I think we covered the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">When do you think the death march began?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">ANSWER:  Now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">QUESTION:  Tell me how you knew it was coming, or did you know, or was it just sudden?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">ANSWER:  When we saw so many bombs falling --- during the night, during the day we only heard boom, boom, boom, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">You couldn't even sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">If you wanted to sleep you couldn't sleep because you heard so many bombs falling, so many shots and things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Then we figured we know it's the Russians at that time because we know it from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that the Russians were invading at that time and we know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">So, we know that the Russians are close. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">So, they closed off the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and at that time, they got everybody together and we started moving out. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">It was December or January. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">We started walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Whoever had a good pair of shoes had a good pair of shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Whoever had most of the time we had that wooden shoe on. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">That's most of the time you were wearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">But sometimes, some people had regular pair of shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I don't know how they got it, but they got it so we were walking most of the time with a wooden shoe. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">We start up it was I could tell you now it was in the evening during dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">We started walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I would estimate 5,000 people, 6,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">We started walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Walked all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">We walked all day, no stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">On the afternoon of the second day, they took us in to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , a farm area and they scattered us all around there in an open <span class="DLF">field</span> where nobody could run away and they had all the SS surrounding us. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I also heard the SS talking <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , some were talking Hungarian, some were talking Polish, most were corroborators. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">So, when we got in that open <span class="DLF">field</span> , I saw a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there was a lot of hay and the <span class="DLF">farms</span> packed it up over there probably for their animals, things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I went in that hay. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I made myself a little <span class="DLF">hole</span> in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">I went in there, the first thing I did I took the shoes off I put my feet in the hay, I took my shoes off and the socks were soaked and wet and frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">I put it around my waist all around and tried to dry them off a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I kept them there for an hour or so, two hours, and then put them back on and started looking for food, whatever you could find. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">There was a lot of <span class="DLF">fields</span> with different type of food packed up over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">They put it away for winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Some people broke in, they took it out, they never came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">They killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I was lucky somehow over there which I find some dry beets things like this, whatever is left and things like this and that's what I ate the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Now, if you don't eat for so many days you get weak and weaker and weaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">The order looks like it was from the commanding officer there. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Anybody who could not walk, you had to eliminate them. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And those collaborators with the Germans they did a good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Anybody who could follow, they shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">They kill them on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">At the time when we walked, we saw so many dead bodies on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , females, male, when we saw those things we tried to pull off a pair of shoes, things like this and that's the way I got my shoes in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I took it off of a dead body. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I took a coat off, some kind of a blanket, so, we kept on walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">We walked for another few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">We --when I say walk, we did not walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">We dragged the legs because you could not raise your leg more than an half an inch. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">There was no strength to raise your feet a little bit, so you were dragging him until you came in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and they were looking for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">It was January at that time already and Europe is very cold this time of the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So, they were looking for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> and they came around the Germans they say the language I had no problem because I spoke the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">So they said there is no more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> we had to go 1n open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">So there was some open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> over there and there was some snow then maybe two feet of snow was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="686">It looks like they didn't use them for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">The first thing we did was a few guys over there with the little strength we had we pushed the snow to the center a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">We went in maybe eighty ninety people in that open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Some of the people you know we were all around, sitting all around that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> but some of the people had no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to get in there so they were staying 1n the center of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">We were leaning one to the other one just to try to get a little warm in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">We were going maybe another day or so then we stopped in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and then one guy was hollering from down there he asked is there anybody that could hear us or see us, so with a little strength I had I went up and looked down. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">So, he was saying in German how many people are in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="693">I counted and there was I think 82 or 84, but I remember counting. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">I told him how many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">They told them I would say approximately about a pound of bread, a little loaf of bread, the same thing about a pound of margarine. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">When I give it out to everybody, there was nothing left. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">It was exactly what I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">So, we were going for another few days, we were driving in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> for another few days and the only food we had was like a piece a bread and the margarine. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">The margarine was so hard that I was nibbling in the margarine. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">It was hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">We didn't know where we were going, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Finally the destination was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">We arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Came to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and there is everybody out from the 80 people I think 20 went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">The rest of them froze to death on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">We went out from that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> where we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">We went in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">They had some soup for us, arrived in there, which I remember we had some soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">We went in there, we got a little soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">They give us showers over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Of course, they cut our hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Cut everything, you know, undress completely, cut everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Went under the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and then they give us a new number because the Auschwitz number, the tattoo number was no good for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="714">So, they give us a new number, and we have to go by the number now because nobody had a name. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">My new number 117,682 so wherever you went you had to know the number because that was your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">There was a few days we were over there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , so we rested a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">The <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> wasn't too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">In there, it was a little warm in that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> at that time, and we had a little soup, things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">We were able to stand on our legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">There came big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they took us to to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> wasn't the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where we were in the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">That was one of the filthiest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">It was so bad in there there was no where to lay down in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">You had to sleep and go lay down wherever you could in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">The lice were eating you up. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">You could take them away with your hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">You could take a whole bunch with one hand and push them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Wherever you turn around, it's like mosquitos, where you go in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> with mosquitos around. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">That's the way the lice were around you. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">So, they got us together again and they put us to work in the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="731">The next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> 's name was . </span><span class="sentence" id="732">We went to work there in a <span class="DLF">mine</span> , a <span class="DLF">stone mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="733">We were digging stones, we were digging dirt out. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">That's the job they gave us. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I don't know really what they were doing over there, but we were working in the <span class="DLF">mine</span> in there, taking stones out. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Then I saw there were little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> in there and there was a lot of and I said to myself you know, maybe I could find out if they had any mechanic work over here and I shouldn't have to dig and shovel rocks out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I went down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">You couldn't run away because you had Nazis all around watching you. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">You couldn't go far. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">You could only go where you were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I went over there and there was two guys, one German, heavyset guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">He was as bad as hell. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">But there was another guy, a Shorter fellow, his name was Max. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">I said to him in German, I said, I am a mechanic and you have so many of those guns, the drill guns, maybe you want me to help you out with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">So, there was a Russian guy also, a prisoner of war, and that guy, he understood that kind of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">He got the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">So, this guy says to me, this guy Max, he says, you know what, he says he's better in this, I have another job for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Go back up to the <span class="DLF">mines</span> and whatever you see needs a little oil, a little fixing, so be the mechanic there and make sure everything runs smooth. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I was very happy he gave me some tools. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I don't think the tools weighed two pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I couldn't even carry the tools. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I was so weak I couldn't even carry those tools, but some how, some way I carried the tools up there, and I was trying to fix whatever I can until the day passed, and then we walked back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> whatever, the way we could walk back. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">We went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which it was because we were working in . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">We passed a lot of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="755">We walked through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which it was written in some <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> 1s only for people who want to gain a little weight. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">In German it was written. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">That <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> is known for . </span><span class="sentence" id="758">It was written over there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="759">When we went through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the Germans, they came out and they brought some food for the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">They feed them food. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">God forbid if one was trying to grab the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">He didn't make it back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="763">We went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">It went on for a little while going back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Then we saw a lot of bombs, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> with a lot of things flying around. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Then we say, something is going on and something will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">From there, it wasn't a long time - it was only a few months in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Then we started walking back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="769">That was the second death march. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">That was the most miserable death march anyone could witness. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">We left a few thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">The way we left and the way we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">I don't think we arrived a few hundred people. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">On the way we were going, the bombs were so great and the artillery fired was so severe, things like this, the Germans were so afraid that they are going to kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">At that time, we had the striped clothes and of course we had some coats, too, striped coats. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">While you were walking, the way you were walking and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> they come so low, they could have picked you off with a machine gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">The Germans I had two Germans under my coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">They were hiding under really my coat they shouldn't be able to be picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">They survived that way, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">I wasn't the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Only the other people were the same way, they did to the other people the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">We were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I saw on the way the <span class="DLF">supply landing strip</span> , with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , with food burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">We were running to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to see if maybe there was some kind of a food leftover, which did not burn. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">When you run to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , the Germans killed you. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">You couldn't even go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="788">There was also a lot of <span class="DLF">farm</span> there was a lot of food from the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="789">There was apples things like this on both sides. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">If you run down to grab an apple the Germans killed you. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">You didn't have to wait for the Nazis to kill you, they killed you once you stepped out of <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="792">It came to a point, I was so weak, I really could not go any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> over there where they picked up, it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they picked up all the people who could not walk anymore, really could not walk, they tell them to go in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they carry them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they put them flat in a German flat <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="794">When I went over there, I got a beating from the Germans with a rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I got hit over the head and I got hit in the stomach and the side and he says to me in German . </span><span class="sentence" id="796">I still could walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">We walked for another few hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">That <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , which I'm supposed to be on they blew it up with grenades out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">They blew the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> up with all the people <span class="NPIP">inside</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Finally, we arrive in <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="801">QUESTION:  Who blew it up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="802">ANSWER:  The Germans, the Germans blew it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">When I saw, before we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , I never saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> how it looks until it came so long, which actually, they waved at us the people over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">That low they came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">I really couldn't make out what kind of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> they were, whether they were British or which Allies they were, but I did find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">They were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I did find out that after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">Then finally we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="809">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> when we arrived it was one of the miserable things that ever happened to anybody in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">You arrived in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">You were laying flat. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">You go in there and first of all you couldn't do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">You were laying in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">You were sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">All kind of sickness you had in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Then a day later they were giving you some soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">Now, you had to stay in the <span class="DLF">line</span> to get some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">There was no such thing anymore about names and numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">You went over to get the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">You were lined up a few thousand people because there was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from before. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">They brought in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">center camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="822">You lined up by the time you took the food -- when they give you the food, by the time a few feet away, they grabbed it from you already. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">The people themselves, the hungry people, they grabbed you. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">You had to be very lucky to eat the food they give it to you over there because somebody would grab it. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">When I saw what happened when it came to my turn, as soon as they put it in, I swallowed it on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">I didn't even carry it further down. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Sometimes I was lucky and I went twice in the <span class="DLF">lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Sometimes I could go twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">A few days later we heard again shouting and we saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> flying on top of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">We heard a lot of shouting going on and that's the time the Germans already came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">They already came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> they started grabbing everybody because there was one <span class="NPIP">place</span> which was still in German hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">They wanted to get the people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">They were still grabbing people and whoever they could, they came in with a gun, and whoever couldn't make it, they shot him on the spot, which before, like I said, a German never came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And they shot so many people on the spot over there, I saw what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">It came to my mind very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I had a in my nose, which it was bleeding all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">I had to touch my nose it was bleeding. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">So, I was laying down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and I touch my nose and whatever blood I had I had in my mouth, put it in my mouth and lay down flat on my back with the eyes turned over. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">I was so skinny. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">I don't know how many pounds I have, maybe 50, 60, 40. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">I don't know how many pounds I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I was laying and then I saw the dead bodies how they look, so I was imitating the dead bodies over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">When the Germans came, two, three, four. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">They all come around, and they first they shot all around whoever made a little move. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">When they came around and the guy was loading the guns he says here's another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">The other said, don't waste your bullets he's . </span><span class="sentence" id="847">He shouldn't shoot anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">I was laying there, maybe an hour, an hour and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">I didn't even want to open my eyes to see who was around. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Then a guy walks around and says whoever can get up get because the Germans are gone, the Americans are here, at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Now we tried to get up whatever we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">I saw American soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">Several of them were speaking Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">They came around and they talk in Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">That was one of the greatest things. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">American soldier to come over to me and say in Yiddish, is there more Jews around? </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I said they're all Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Most of them are all Jews around. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">They were trying to do whatever they can. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">They did not touch us because we were all sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Not to get any disease from that thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">I see more soldiers and more soldiers coming around and checking out what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Later on, a while later I find out that guy who was watching and looking there it was General Patton's third army. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">Those people liberated us. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">It took a little while until everybody come to himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">It was one of the biggest mistake that our own people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> did. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">They went and emptied out all the food that the Germans had accumulated. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">They brought it in to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Nobody told us be careful, your stomach has shrunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">We started eating whatever we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I got a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in a box of dog dishes and I kept on eating dog dishes until I got typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I got so sick they took me in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">camp hospital</span> , which it was a <span class="BUILDING">Nazi hospital</span> and guess who was the doctor? </span><span class="sentence" id="873">The Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">The German Nazis who wanted to destroy me, they are the ones that treated me in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp because</span> they were prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">It took quite a while until I came to myself but I could tell you one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">I had a headache for five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I couldn't get rid of the headache day and night from that typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">What happened to the other people? </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Most of them died from overeating after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">They were eating -- there were so many things to eat it was a very few people who understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">Then the German doctor told me in German, don't eat so much because your stomach is not strong enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">We felt a little better. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">We went out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilmar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="884">That's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="885">We saw so many American soldiers over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">I don't know, there were thousands and thousands. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And they all were trying to help us, to give us something. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">One guy was giving candy, another guy a box of chocolate. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">What they did over there was trying to help us out to stay on our legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">That wasn't so good either. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">You wouldn't get it, we would get sick with so much food. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I got a hold of a box of chewing gum. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I took the box of chewing gum and I take one and oh, that tastes good. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">I take another one, that tastes good. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Then I took four or five at the time and oh, that tastes good. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">I swallowed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">I must have swallowed a few hundred chewing gums. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">Then I had the stomach cramps. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and they had to pump my stomach because it was full of chewing gums. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">Then the American comes over, a Jewish soldier comes over and he says to me in Yiddish, , you chew that thing, you don't eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">I said how do you chew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">So he showed me how you chew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">When I went out again in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , I saw so many people chewing that we recognize right away our people because they were chewing so funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">We know right away from looking around everybody wanted to be an American to chew the gum at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">So we were over there I'd say about a month or two months. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">Then they had lists over there of where your family and friends from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="907">You could go in there and take a look and if you recognize anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">I saw my three sisters in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> not far from there, in . </span><span class="sentence" id="909">There was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">busses</span> provided by the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Inside there was no more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , so I was riding on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> , on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">So, I got there to it's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="912">half of the was the <span class="REGION">American side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="913">So, finally I found then my sisters went to the Berger-meister to the mayor in there and my sisters told him -- I went there with another friend from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="914">So the Berger-meister made sure that we had food and he gave us a <span class="NPIP">place</span> over there, and he put over there in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> so this was the way we were all together at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">So that time we were together with three sisters, and I ask my sisters, because we had four sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">One sister I know, the younger one, they went with my mother I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">So, I asked my other one, I said where is Esther, my younger sister? </span><span class="sentence" id="918">So, she says, she died of the typhus, and they kept her where she was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">So, I saw we were together and then we made all the preparation to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> to find out to see maybe somebody is left to see us start life out again. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">That is the time they made the agreement the way how <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> between the British, the Americans and Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">Due to the fact that the Russians were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , so the Americans had to go there too, so they gave up all the <span class="REGION">area</span> over there to the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And the Americans pulled in. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">We was still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in because we wanted to make preparation to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> to see who's left. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">As the gang comes over, Jewish soldiers, and they said to us, all right, let's go in because we're going to leave the <span class="REGION">area</span> and this is the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">When we were children we were told how good communism, how good the Russians are, how good everything is so you could have such a nice life. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">You don't have to work, you get everything for nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">When the guy told us this, I said what are you talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">We were told how good it is by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">Why should we leave them. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">They're in the <span class="REGION">area</span> we're going to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">That Jewish captain, because he had some stripes, he says it's not what they told you, it's what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">We were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">The Americans left. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">Boy were we sorry the next day what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">That comes around, a bunch of Russians, dirty with watches on their arms, five or six watches, running after the girls which they couldn't stand on their legs how weak they are, saying if you step out of the <span class="DLF">line</span> , we'll send you to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="936">That was the thank you when they saw us over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">We're going to send you to different type of work now, if you don't behave and things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">So, we started making preparations to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">We took <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , whatever they had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">It took weeks and weeks from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovaks</span> to and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="941">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="942">We find already some collaborators from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and we tried to turn them in to the Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">We told them what happened with them and then we kept on and we went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="944">We went back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="945">There was nothing left in there in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , just a few people came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">We tried to see what we could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">We couldn't work it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">We packed up whatever we had and we turned back. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">The turning back was not so easy because you had to go out of the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="950">We went in -- from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> we went into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="951">We were staying in the <span class="DLF">field</span> all day long because the Russians should not catch us to take us back to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Finally we went into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> there was already operating a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> from . </span><span class="sentence" id="953">We had food in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">We had shelter in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Our <span class="NPIP">destination</span> was not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="956">Our <span class="NPIP">destination</span> was further down to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , whatever we go. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">So, we went to the <span class="DLF">border</span> by <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> -<span class="DLF">Hungary border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="958">There was a Russian guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">His name was Sashka. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">We sold something <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wishno</span> , whatever we had, and we got a little money in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">This guy Sashka had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and for a fee he took you over to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , because he couldn't cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="962">This guy filled up a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with people like cattle flat down, and we went across to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="963">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="964">When we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> there was already in the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> , and we had to stay there a little bit in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> until they got all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">Then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saltzburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="966">When we went through the <span class="DLF">border</span> , the Russians had to examine everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">If they're not some of them were running away from the Army, which there was a lot of Russian Jewish officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">They came with us because they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="969">So, they wanted to see if there were any deserters and things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">So, we said we were all Greeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">We went on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> as all Greeks from the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">They came around no, we're Greek. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">So, finally we cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> and went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lenz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="974">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lenz</span> , that's right over the <span class="DLF">border</span> and we went over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saltzburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Then we settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saltzburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="976">I had one sister, she did not leave <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> so my brother went back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saltzburg</span> to bring him back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saltzburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="977">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saltzburg</span> for a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">In the meantime, I was training myself to be a soldier, and Israeli soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">I was training . </span><span class="sentence" id="980">| was very good in the training thing, which they told me I do very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">My sister find out from my aunt, we had a few aunts, a couple aunts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="982">She remembers the others where they are, so she wrote a letter to them, and they got back a letter with some money in the envelope in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">He says, don't go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="984">You have time to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="985">First come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and then you go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="986">Let's come over here first and settle. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">I was ready to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , so we had a big debate, and she told us how good <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">They said they have everything you could find even money on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="989">I said to myself and to my brother, I said listen, look they have the Marshall plan, they got everything for nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">Couldn't you imagine if you get everything over here for nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">Couldn't you imagine if you go to the source. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">So, finally we decided we go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="993">I came with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> with General Greeley. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">It was an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="995">I came in December 1949. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">It took over a week to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="997">I worked in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , also. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">I worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , which I couldn't work too much because I was so seasick for a few days but then I felt better and I went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> which the aunts picked us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">So I was in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , and also when they picked us up there was a taxi driver and he put six in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> to take us over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">I was the last one to get out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> and I looked down and I looked all over and so the guy asked me in Yiddish he says, , what are you looking for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">I said I look for dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">He says, boy if you come for that, he says you don't know how you're going to get here until you get a dollar. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">That was the hello in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">So, then I went to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , and then I got through friends, I got a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> only a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">There's a lot I left out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">When we went back with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to ride back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> inside of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">We were riding on the slate roofs on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> for days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">When a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> came, you had to lay down flat before you know, you could get killed and things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">To go back, we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , like I said, I got a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">I got a job in the <span class="BUILDING">metal factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">First I did odd jobs all over and then I got a job in a <span class="BUILDING">metal factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">I was doing
