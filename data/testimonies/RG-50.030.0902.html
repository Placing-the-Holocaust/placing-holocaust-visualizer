<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Ah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  In getting people — probably both Roma and Jewish people, helping them escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">The image that I have of my father was that he was red — red hair, or red and — with a red beard, possibly, or maybe just red hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And having a radio playing, and he would be tinkering with electrical things, with the radio, maybe <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , taking it apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And I later learned that he was an electrician. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So playing with radios and things, and that there would be music playing on the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So, in my very earliest memories, those were kind of the memories that I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">After a couple of years, after my mother was taken —

ANSWER:  Ne — well, what I know was that we were all arrested, and we were incarcerated in the — the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  This is what I’ve learned, but I don’t have memories of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">The memories that I have is that from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , at some point, we moved to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , or a <span class="DLF">fruit orchard</span> , about 60 kilometers east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  East of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  East of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , so toward — towards the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And always sort of playing by myself in a <span class="DLF">field</span> , digging up potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Why — why potatoes? </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Maybe that’s all there was in the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But being by myself.</span></p>

QUESTION:  So you remember being hungry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Cold and hungry, and always being alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And — and then asking — always saying to my sister, Gertrude, I’m so alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Or, why am I always alone? </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So, I know that there was another family living in hiding with us, or at least on the same <span class="REGION">property</span> , and maybe there were children, but I have no recollection of being with other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And maybe we did play together. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I mean, here I was three or four years old, or four — four to five years old, and only thinking of myself as being alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  So, I want to step back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">The conclusion we can come to is that you had a mother for three and a half years, maybe, of your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And then she disappears.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  Gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Just out — out — out of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">But — but I still had all my sisters and my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And my sister Gertrude, I think sort of filled the <span class="NPIP">place</span> of my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">So I felt very close to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And — and to this day, I mean, she is a very motherly, nurturing kind of person. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And so, my bond with my siblings is primarily to her, and to my brother Alphonse(ph).</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="407">QUESTION:  What were their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">ANSWER:  Rosalind and Joshua Spiegel. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">They were not interested in being foster parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">They wanted to be adoptive parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">My father, Joshua Spiegel, was a neurosurgeon. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">He had operated on Mary Lawrence, who was the director of the Jewish Children’s Bureau. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And at some point he had said to her, we are interested in adopting a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And so, when we came through the JCB, she thought perhaps I would be a good candidate. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I was still young. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I was only, you know, six and a half at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I’d — so I lived with them for a while, and when they asked me if I September 28, 2016 wanted to be adopted, I didn’t know — I didn’t know any better, I said, oh yeah, these are nice people, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I would like that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  But — and at that time — this was, you know, 1946, the rules for adoption, and the best thinking of social workers and psychologists, was that no contact was to be maintained with families of origin, because it would be too difficult —
QUESTION:  Can we cut? [</span><span class="sentence" id="431">break] So you were talking about the kind of thinking that was going on at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Tha — about —
ANSWER:  Thinking about adoption and foster care, and the thinking at that time was, number one, documents were not public. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Everything that was done was hidden https://collections.ushmm.org September 28, 2016 away. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">So, it — which kind of played into my earlier mentioning of deception, and sort of — and rather than overt deception, it’s hiding, keeping things private.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  Not talking about things, and sort of keeping things hidden away from view. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So once I moved in with the Spiegels, I actually saw my sisters and brother — probably more my sisters, several of them, quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">But my mother, of course — not of course, my mother, Rosalind Spiegel was in consultation both with the social workers at the Jewish Children’s Bureau, and with a psychiatrist who recommended that contact with my siblings be discontinued, because I was too confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">When my sister would come over, there was always talk about don’t forget Mama, don’t forget Papa. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">We’re all together, don’t forget them. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">So, of course, I would want to be with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Then, when I was with these foster people, soon to become my adoptive parents, it was difficult to relate to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And I think I would lash out at them, or act out, especially towards my mother, my foster mother Rosalind. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And she was then advised to stop contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Now, when I say contact, maybe they came what, two or three times, and then it was decided that — I mean, I was too young to really make a choice, but it was decided that it would be in my best interest to identify with this new family, so that they could become my family, so that I would be given the opportunity, you know, to have a stable home life, and not be torn between mySeptember 28, 2016 loyalty to my German siblings, and my loyalty to my new American family. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I did not have access to my papers, my German papers until I was an adult. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So this would be 1958, 1960. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And even then, when I called the Jewish Children’s Bureau to say, I want to see my case file, they gave me a very hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">This is not public. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I said, I’m not public, this is my case file. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And I had to sort of argue with them, before they finally released the files.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">QUESTION:  And what did you learn in those files?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">ANSWER:  What did I learn? </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I learned that my father had remarried, my German father had remarried. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I learned that the Jewish Children’s Bureau knew that my father was living. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I—I don’t think I learned too much more than that, but I knew — I learned that the JCB knew that I didn’t have to be hiding the fact that I had a father living in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> all these years. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I didn’t have to continue the deception.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="459">ANSWER:  It was a—
QUESTION:  That must have burden —
ANSWER:  It was — it was a terrible burden. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">It was a burden because — and — and the burden continued for many years, because I felt this tremendous loyalty towards my American parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">But I also had this desire to know about my German family. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I knew that they all lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">What I didn’t know, was not only did they https://collections.ushmm.org September 28, 2016 know where I lived, they knew what I was doing, where I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">They would some — they would sort of keep tabs on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">They — 1-1-in a — in a good way, they wanted to make sure everything was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I remember I went to the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I remember — and tha — I was now in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I remember going down the <span class="DLF">street</span> with my classmates, we were going from one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> a couple of blocks away, to another <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , turning around and seeing some young women kind of following — following us. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And I had no idea why. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Well, it was two of my sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">We all lived on the south side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , not too far away from each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">They were — they saw me on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and were following me. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">I mean, there was nothing bad about that —

<p><span class="sentence" id="477">ANSWER:  It was — it was implied. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">You have a new family. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">You have — you have to learn a — you have to learn a new language. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">You are now an American, you’re not a — you’re not German. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">You know, it was very exciting time for me to be — to get — I was a naturalized citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">In 1951, I became a US. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">citizen, that’s a big time. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">But the https://collections.ushmm.org September 28, 2016 implication was pretty clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Oh, at — that 1t would be better for me to make my — to sort of make my allegiance to this family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">QUESTION:  So in other words, they — they put it gi — you know, and the way you are explaining it is, with the best of intentions, but the way they put it, it’s either us or them, and it should be us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">ANSWER:  It— yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Now, it wasn’t — it wasn’t — I wasn’t given the option, you can go back to them, and then it won’t be us. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">It wasn’t that. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">It was, you’re here, you’re our daughter, we love you, we’ll take care of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">This is the way it should be. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And, because of the acting out that I had been doing — I’m not exactly sure what acting out I was doing, except I was probably —
