<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  And that is the name you were born with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  When were you born and where were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born on August 22, 1923 in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> at the time called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , the capital of <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Now it’s called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wroctaw</span> and it’s part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Let’s talk a little bit about your family, about your parents, who they were and their names.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  My father, Henry, was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mamel</span> [ph] which is in, near <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">It’s now a military base of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And he moved to <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> , at some point. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I don’t know exactly when. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And eventually landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> where he was in business. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">His name was Henry because his father had been an Anglophile and that led to all kinds of complications to which we can return perhaps for Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Would you like me to talk about it now? </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Let’s talk about it later. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Yeah, my mother Rosa Lipziger [ph] and her maiden name, was born in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> , called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlictenstein</span> [ph]. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">At some point she must also have moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> and my father, they got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I don’t know the exact date.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  And what kind of work did your father do? </span><span class="sentence" id="18">https://collections.ushmm.org March 18, 2013
ANSWER:  My father was a small businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I don’t think he was very successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I’m not sure exactly why that was so because at the times he was a Jew and it was getting difficult to do business in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , obviously, during the Nazi period in particular. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">He had a <span class="BUILDING">wholesale store</span> for stockings and socks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  And your mother, did she work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  No, she did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">We were two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I had a small brother who unfortunately died in an accident at an early age. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I think he was eight so I was the only child. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">But my mother did not work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  And your brother’s name was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  Franz.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  What kind of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> did you live in? </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Was it a Jewish, a non-Jewish mixed neighborhood or was it predominantly Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  I really don’t think there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhoods</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Things were very intermixed which is quite typical of course for German Jewry who as you know were well assimilated by and large. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">We lived in two <span class="NPIP">locations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Velatslav</span> [ph] some 15 years ago, the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where we had lived, didn’t exist anymore and the second one hardly at all either. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So we lived in two <span class="NPIP">locations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">We had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and we had a maid which was kind of expected for any middle class Jewish family, even though my father could hardly afford it but he did have one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  So your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> was made up of Jewish and non-Jewish children whom you played with I assume.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Yeah, I went to a regular <span class="BUILDING">German public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Whether there were any other Jewish children in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">class</span> , I can’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Certainly, possibly not. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Certainly in the, in the https://collections.ushmm.org March 18, 2013 <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Later on I transferred to a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and there probably were other Jewish children in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">class</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Now I think I was allowed to stay in this <span class="BUILDING">German high school</span> because my father had been a what they call a frontkempfer [ph], somebody who had fought in combat in World War I, and Jews who had that status had at the beginning certain privileges. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">One of them was that while other Jewish children had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">German schools</span> , I was allowed to stay in that <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> for a little longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">But eventually we all had to leave anyway and I transferred to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish gymnasium</span> and I went to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> until 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  Do you remember when you transferred, what year it was when you transferred?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I would think it probably was 37.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  37.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  Something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  Let’s talk a little bit more about your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Were they very assimilated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  Quite, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">My parents did go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on high holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I think the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , the largest in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , was probably conservative. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">There was Pesach in our family which my father could not conduct but we had an uncle who did know the ritual and he usually conducted the Seder. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And there was a large gathering. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I would think perhaps about 12, 14 people at Pesach time. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But that was about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I was bar mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">But that was kind of expected. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">It was socially expected so it was more a social ritual than a religious one. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I certainly had no strong religious feelings one way or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I liked the bar mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I got lots of presents. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So basically our family was yes, assimilated. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">My father belonged to an organization called Risebund Judische Front Soldaten [ph]. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">That meant the national organization of Jewish combat soldiers in World War I. He was very proud of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And again that was a fairly typical attitude on the part of German Jews at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  What language did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="72">https://collections.ushmm.org March 18, 2013
ANSWER:  What did you expect? </span><span class="sentence" id="73">German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  Let’s talk also now about your extended family. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">You mentioned about your uncle helping to conduct the Seder. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Did you have a large extended family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  We had a large family yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  On both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">On your mother’s —
ANSWER:  On both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Very large family, including grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I enjoyed visiting my grand — one of my grandparents lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> near where my mother had been born, also in <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I enjoyed visiting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I had some friends there. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">The most successful in our family was my mother’s brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">He had a business, <span class="BUILDING">wholesale business</span> in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and was very successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">He was really quite rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And he had been a, also an officer in World War I. He was altogether a very stately German appearance, tall, straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">There is an interesting story connected to him which I think would be of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  His name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  His name was Friedel Lipziger. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Lipziger was my mother’s maiden name. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">He considered himself even more German than anyone else in our family because of his background and I remember a family gathering, must have been around 1936 and I, being all of 13, dared to say, I was in a youth movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Ill come back to that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I dared to say that perhaps one should think of emigrating and you know this was 36, three years into the Nazi regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">My uncle took me by the scruff and shook me back and forth and said what do you understand about such things? </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Ok, that was in 1936 I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">He very soon however must have had, begin to have second thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So to be on the safe side, he started to ship out money, illegally of course and one of the couriers who had my uncle’s money was caught and he had a list of names. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So one afternoon, my uncle got a telephone call from the police chief of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Now mind you, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> was a city of 600,000 people so the police chief was quite somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">It so happened that https://collections.ushmm.org March 18, 2013 he was a war comrade of my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And he said Friedel, this and this has happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I give you three hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">You must get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Otherwise I will come to arrest you. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So my uncle took his family, his wife and daughter and got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and left for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So that was the end of my uncle who had thought that it was stupid to think of emigrating. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">He then from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> got to <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> where he again opened a highly successful <span class="BUILDING">wood business</span> , which was very appropriate for <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> and he became perhaps even richer than before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  Let’s talk about your life from 1923 to 1933, until Hitler came into power. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">What memories, I know you were a child, you were only ten years old but —
ANSWER:  Ihave memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I have rather —
QUESTION:  Talk about some of those memories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Well for one thing, I belonged to a youth movement and that is important for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  At that young age?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Yes, I must have joined perhaps when I was eight, nine, very early. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">This was a youth movement which called itself German Jewish Boy Scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And German Jewish was more German than it was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We sang German songs and we had a little uniform and flags and we would parade up and down and go on hikes and so forth and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">It also was kind of romantic. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It, the German youth movement has been described by writers like Walter Laqueur and others and it had this romantic flavor to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">You were opposed to the philistines and you dreamt of some wonderful future in which you would be important, intellectually perhaps. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And so this I think in many ways was very important for my own thinking and, and future life. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">It sort of shaped me quite significantly I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Then came Hitler in 33 and we were forbidden to use uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And then we were also forbidden to go on hikes and on the last hike that we had staged we were attacked in the middle of the night and had to leave and go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Attacked because you were a Jewish group? </span><span class="sentence" id="126">https://collections.ushmm.org March 18, 2013
ANSWER:  Because we were a Jewish group, hiking which we were — and, and having a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which we’re not supposed to have anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But they hadn’t informed us that formally so we still were doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So that was the end of hiking and —
QUESTION:  Who was the leader of your group? </span><span class="sentence" id="129">The adult leader?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  The leader of my group was someone called Walter Laqueur who was quite known as an historian. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">He was all of two years older than we were in this group but he was our leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">That’s how he was known. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And we would get together and several times a month and read things and discuss things or listen to classical music and so forth and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Then about 1934 it must have been, perhaps 35, our organization merged with a Zionist organization called Zichloiter and that organization in turn eventually became part of Hashomer Hatzair. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And the Hashomer Hatzair is something that eventually became known in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> as Mapai, as you probably know. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So our, the character of our life changed in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">We all of a sudden started to sing Jewish and Hebrew songs and learn something about our Jewish background of which we were frightfully ignorant until then. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And we became kind of Zionists, gradually. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And this went on for a few years. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And then came Kristallnacht in November of 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Now shortly before that I had gone to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> in <span class="REGION">southern Germany</span> in preparation for going to what was then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And it was called Hasharavy [ph]. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">That term means something for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And we were there, about 30 Jewish kids and we were learning agriculture. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And on Kristallnacht the first thing we heard things over the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And it was too late to leave so we sort of barricaded ourselves and hoped for the best. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">But sure enough a large group of storm troopers eventually appeared and attacked and beat us up rather badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And some people were hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And the event dispersed and everyone went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">When I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> my father had been arrested, like all German Jews at the time, all male German Jews and taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">He was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And now I come back to Henry, my father’s name. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">As I said his father had been an Anglophile. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">He had been called Henry. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Came World War I and my father volunteered for military service to fight against the perfidious Albion. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">You could not be called Henry. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So they changed his name to Heinrich. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So some of his papers were Heinrich and some of his papers were Henry. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And of course that became a cause Celebrex for the German https://collections.ushmm.org March 18, 2013 bureaucracy in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="160">They didn’t know what to make of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And he therefore was one of the last to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">The procedure was that you would, they would let people out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> if they had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go to, to emigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">The whole, one of the main purposes of the arrest of the male Jews was to put pressure on them to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">At that time, and that is also confirmed by written documents that we have. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">The main idea was to push the Jews out, get rid of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And so if you had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to emigrate to, they would release you. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">But because of my father, with this mix up of names, he was one of the last to get out, even though we had a possibility to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Now this is, this involves the following. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">My father’s brother and sister had been early Zionists. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">They had belonged to a German Zionist organization called Blue White, Blau Weis, very well known. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And they left for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in the 20s already and had become well established in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">My aunt, my father’s sister was a librarian at the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">My, his brother was a well-known architect in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And they tried to get permission for my parents to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  Their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Bruno Lewy and Alma Shunami. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">She married a man who became quite well known after World War II, Alex Shunami, because he was sent by the Yeshuv to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">He was a librarian as well to recover stolen German books and became quite well known in that capacity. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">He was very successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">He got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and an American chauffeur and he was able to move all around and recover German books by the thousands, stolen Jewish books by the thousands. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Anyway that was my aunt’s husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">They tried to get permission for my parents to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> but the British did not let any adults in. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">They let young people in, but not adults.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  Was your father a Zionist?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  No, not at all but you know by that time he had realized. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I mean after Kristallnacht in particular —
QUESTION:  Preceding that, he had not been. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">https://collections.ushmm.org March 18, 2013
ANSWER:  They may have been thinking about emigrating but nothing concrete had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">The problem, as you probably know, was to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to take you. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">The problem was not to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> but to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to take you. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">There was legal emigration out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> until October 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">So the problem was to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , not to get out, get permission to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">The Nazis were pushing the Jews out. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So he had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> but my uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> worked very hard on this and it didn’t move forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So as an interim measure, they came up with the following. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">My uncle’s wife was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and her brother was Grand redam [ph] de <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> so the chief rabbi of <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> , the chief rabbi of <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So they arranged for a permit for my parents to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And so I left in March of 39 for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> with Youth Aliyah, because I wanted to be in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And my parents shortly thereafter left for <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in March of 1939 and went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">QUESTION:  We’ll get to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">How did your parents feel about your desire to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  They were not crazy about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">They would have preferred if I had stayed with them, but they respected my wish and accepted it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">QUESTION:  And you were 16 by then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  Iwas 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  Let’s go back in time a little bit.. You were ten years old when Hitler came into power.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  What did he mean to a ten year old boy? </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Did you have any, do you remember any speeches he made or appearances? </span><span class="sentence" id="210">https://collections.ushmm.org March 18, 2013

<p><span class="sentence" id="236">QUESTION:  Was it something you talked over with your friends?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="432">ANSWER:  Ihave his name somewhere possibly. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I don’t remember now. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And so my parents came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in 41, late 41 I believe and it must have been shortly thereafter probably that we got into contact again. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">There was mail then from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Yeah so after two years, our youth group — the procedure was that after two years Youth Aliyah meant two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">You were together as a group for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And after that what normally happened was that the group would stay in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> and become part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> in which they had been for two years as regular members of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">In our case, I don’t know https://collections.ushmm.org March 18, 2013 why but our, somehow our group did not cohere well. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">We didn’t get along too well with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">The group dissolved so we did not stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And people went to different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutzim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And I and some others went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Emek Beit She’an</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Amal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And we must have been there for a relatively short time and then from there I switched to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ma’ Barot</span> , which is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hadera</span> in central, in the center of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And I was there perhaps for half a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And that was the time, must have been early 42 when Rommel, perhaps a bit later. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Rommel stood at the <span class="DLF">gates</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Things looked rather ominous. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">The Nazis were in <span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">We, large numbers of us volunteered for the British Army and I did too. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">So I joined the British army and it, the unit was first called Palestine regiment. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">There were several Jewish companies and one Arab company. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And we were together made up the Palestine regiment. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And we were used for guard duty in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Lebanon</span> , on <span class="BUILDING">convoys</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Not a terribly interesting time. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And we wanted to get into combat of course, to fight the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">But the Brits opposed. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">It was the same situation as in World War I. They did not want to give the Jews political capital by accepting them as combatants. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So time dragged on. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">But eventually as a result of various endeavors in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , the Jewish brigade was formed, out of the units, companies from the Palestine regiment and several other companies, engineering, Jewish engineering companies and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">They became the Jewish brigade. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And we were taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> for our last combat training and then transferred to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> where we became part of Montgomery’s Eighth Army and we participated in the final push. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">That must have been late 44, early 45. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">So that was my time in — altogether came to four years because when the war ended we were in April of 45, we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and at that point the Jewish brigade was transferred to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to guard German prisoners of war who were clearing <span class="DLF">mines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I didn’t think it was terribly interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">So.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Do you remember any emotional reaction you had at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">You were in your early 20s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">ANSWER:  I don’t recall any particular reaction, other than what I said before. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">One felt very, had strong feeling about Hitler, about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">In fact when the brigade was moved, we moved by, with our own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Some of the drivers, they amused themselves by running down Germans on the <span class="DLF">highway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And we probably thought that was ok at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I feel bad about it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I don’t enjoy that memory but I know it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">https://collections.ushmm.org March 18, 2013 And it was kind of a natural reaction because of what we had seen, and what we had heard and what we had encountered. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I should say a little about something else, namely our participation in combat, as part of Montgomery’s Eighth Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">We were, we occupied a segment of the front and right next to us was a Polish unit, And these were the Anders soldiers who had left <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and come to the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> and who also then became part of the British army. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And they, hearing that there were Jews next to them, they amused themselves by cutting our telephone wires. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Occasionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So there were no good feelings between us, even though we were fighting the same enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">It so happened that I was on a patrol that took the first German prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And that came about kind of fortuitously without design. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">We went out on a combat patrol towards the <span class="DLF">German lines</span> and got, went a little further. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">We were about a squad perhaps of eight with an officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And we moved a little further ahead without intending to perhaps. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And all of a sudden found ourselves in the <span class="DLF">German line</span> and there was a German shelter, a dug out and we heard voices <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And I was the only German speaking one. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And I shouted down Raus, Juden en dar and that became a big story because this was the first time that the brigade had taken German prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And my shouting Raus, Juden en dar made all the newspapers and became —

<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  I don’t recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I do recall one other thing and that is interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">When we were billeted in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Austrian town</span> for a time, the illegal migration required quite a bit of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">One had to bribe, one had to get <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">They used our own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I mean it’s an amazing thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">There 1s a tape about the Jewish brigade which describes this with pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">It was amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">We used our official <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to transport these people to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">How we got away with it I don’t know but we had our own military police, that’s why. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">We had our own military police. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">There was no one who could stop us. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I mean so that was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">But it required money, lots of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And we all contributed as best we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">We didn’t have very much money. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">But so one day three of us in this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Austrian town</span> thought well maybe we can liberate some money for the good cause. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">So we went through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we came to some very fancy <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we went in and right in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> was a big picture of an SS man and a woman was there, his wife and daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">We searched the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and then we found a large sum of money which we confiscated and liberated and handed over to the captain of our unit who was in charge of collecting money. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Well the woman went first to the mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And then the mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> came to the company commander and said three soldiers had robbed this woman of all her money and that’s unacceptable and the commander had to agree, yes it’s unacceptable. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">So it was decided that next morning the company would be lined up on the <span class="DLF">town square</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">The women would try to identify the culprits. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Well our commander of course had heard what and why what had happened and why, what had happened to the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">So when the company lined up on the <span class="DLF">village square</span> , the three of us, we’re not part of the lineup. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">We were allowed to go up into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> a little bit https://collections.ushmm.org March 18, 2013 and we watched the whole procedure from top. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">That is described also in the book called The Brigade. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">There’s a book called The Brigade where the incident is described. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">It was kind of fun to look down how she went around and tried of find us and of course we weren’t in the lineup.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">QUESTION:  She didn’t falsely accuse anybody else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">ANSWER:  I’m sorry, no she did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">No, no she did not, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Ok so to come back to -- we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">The brigade was in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and I found guarding these German prisoners when they were clearing the <span class="DLF">mines</span> not a very interesting occupation, a boring and I thought it would be nice to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">So I went AWOL, A-W-L. It meant you know leave without, leave without permission and I hitchhiked to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the British occupation and presented myself and said here I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I know German and I think I could be more useful in this capacity. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">He said yes it sounds good. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">So I was transferred to a military police unit in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wuppertal</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ruhr</span> as an interpreter. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And I must have done this for about half a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">That was much more interesting and we would occasionally pick up some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">You know and so forth and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">It was a much more interesting time. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">But then came demobilization.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="585">QUESTION:  What was your gut feeling in talking to them as a Jew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I just found it interesting to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I don’t recall any — I mean as I had mentioned before when first we encountered these survivors, we had rather strong feelings but <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was smashed and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in which we found ourselves, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wuppertal</span> , probably wasn’t a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And it was kind of hard to have any strong negative feelings to these people who are scratching around, trying to find enough to eat and who were obviously in miserable shape at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">So I don’t think we had, I had any particularly strong feelings at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">https://collections.ushmm.org March 18, 2013 Then came demobilization, That is to say what came from the brigade that my turn had come to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">We are all being sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> for demobilization. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I was sent back and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">demobilization camp</span> was in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holon</span> which is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">QUESTION:  When you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> did you feel like you were back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">ANSWER:  No, I don’t think I felt that being back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> but as I say I don’t have, I don’t recall any particular strong feelings one way or the other just that it was an interesting time and good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I mean I was well paid and I had my own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , in contrast to before. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I actually I forgot to mention. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I was promoted to corporal while we were still in <span

there. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> on which I was traveling was stopped by military police and I was caught without a pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And I ended up overnight in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and the next morning I lost my stripes as corporal. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And I was a private again. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">But when we were in the brigade after that episode of the capturing the German prisoners, I was promoted and eventually became a sergeant. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Now being a sergeant in the British army is nothing great. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I mean you’re a noncommissioned officer but it’s no great fanciful existence and in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> particularly the food was very bad and never enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">We would sometimes smuggle ourselves into the <span

market</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and making a fortune. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">But yeah so I was a sergeant and as a sergeant then I was the interpreter in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and that was another good existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Had my own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Eventually I got back to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="610">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">demobilization camp</span> was at <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="613">And I remember her being from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rehovot</span> and I made some inquiries and I looked her up and she eventually became my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">We became engaged several months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And she had been studying medicine since there was no anatomy, you know real study

was rather lengthy and bureaucratic. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">I don’t know why but it was, took a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">So we were allowed to go back to our <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we had lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , kibbutz Ma’ Barot. </span><span

another recollection I have of that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">That must have been late 46. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Yeah, must have been yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Well so I got permission to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>

were some people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> who in the meantime had come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> from the youth movement. </span><span class="sentence"

(</span><span class="sentence" id="1031">laughs) And then she showed no more interest in her Jewishness until as I say most recently when all of a sudden and I don’t know what brought it about, she developed this interest in the Holocaust and our background and now researching it and reading, doing nothing but that, very interesting.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1036">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">I think for an academic that’s very easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">The academic environment 1s largely secular. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">I mean there are of course religious people, but the overall atmosphere is secular and so we never felt any need to belong to a congregation let’s say because our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was academia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">You know the <span class="BUILDING">college</span> or the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> where you were affiliated with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">Your friends, their colleagues, some Jewish, some non-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">Some of my best friends, I can truly say are not Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">I mean in the most literal sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">I have very close friends who are not Jewish and whom we met, whom we met teaching fellow colleagues in other <span class="DLF">fields</span> sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1045">QUESTION:  Tell me about the books you’ve written. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">You mentioned the first book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">https://collections.ushmm.org March 18, 2013
ANSWER:  Well I’ve always had an interest in you might say the moral dimension of politics and history and so some of my books involved the kind of moral dilemma of the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> in Nazi Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">Second book yeah and then I did several other books on Nazi Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">The Nazi persecution of the Gypsies and mostly it’s the, wasn’t there was something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">Oh yes, I’m going on book censorship in Nazi Germany and I had a Fulbright for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">So I had an interest in Nazi Germany, the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">I’ve written some other things, on <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> which came about during the Vietnam war period when I was interested in the problems raised by our involvement there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">I was the first one to be admitted to the military classified records as a researcher, an outside researcher and that enabled me to write a very interesting book and became kind of a standard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">And I’ve written on religion several books that interest me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1055">QUESTION:  On different religions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1056">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">Well for different religions too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">I wrote a book called Religion and the Revolution which is kind of comparative religion but I have been interested in the moral issue of can you be a moral human being without being religious and that has interested me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">I have written two books about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">And the last book is called If God 1s Dead, Everything is Permitted, question mark. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">You know the saying from the Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky, but I put it with a question mark. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">Dostoevsky felt yes, 1f you don’t believe in god, you cannot be moral. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">My position which I developed in this book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">I said yes you could, you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">So that has been a lot of my interest yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1066">QUESTION:  I’m sure many people have asked you, has the world learned lessons from the Holocaust? </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">What your thoughts are on that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1068">ANSWER:  We have had episodes of genocide, numerous since 1945 so that problem is not solved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">Pretty horrible episodes of violence have taken place. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">I think the Holocaust was not unique, precisely because more genocides have taken place since. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">It was in many sense, cases unprecedented. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">It was unprecedented that they, cultured nation in the center of Europe would organize this program to exterminate an entire people, man, woman and child and hunt them down all over the continent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">In that sense it was unprecedented. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">It never happened before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">The https://collections.ushmm.org March 18, 2013 Jews were not particularly hostile to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">On the contrary the German Jews were better Germans than many Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">And yet it took place in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">So in that sense it was something quite unprecedented. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">It was not unique as I say because we’ve had genocides since and we unfortunately are, haven’t solved that problem yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">And we may never be able to solve it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">If, when I’m finished with my book on book censorship in Nazi Germany, if I still have what it takes to write another one, I want to do something on the perpetrators, the Nazi perpetrators, why they did it, how, various explanations that have been put forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">And I sort of want to bring all that together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">There is some interesting work being done on this in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1084">QUESTION:  You said you had done some work at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1085">ANSWER:  I was a volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">That’s, for a time I did some projects for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1088">QUESTION:  What kind of projects?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1089">ANSWER:  I did a project on the bombing of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">And I felt that their exhibit was misleading. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">And I think they have changed it a bit since then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">There has been some other writing on this by other researchers as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1093">QUESTION:  How was their exhibit misleading?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1094">ANSWER:  Well they sort of implied very strongly at the begin — in the original exhibit that 1t was a serious dereliction on the part of the Americans that they did not bomb <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">And I tried to show that A, the ability to hit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with any precision was strictly limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">We didn’t have the <span class="BUILDING">bases</span> close enough to reach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with any great numbers of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">Hitting with precision was altogether impossible at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">All one could do was carpet bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">That’s why the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German cities</span> looked what they looked after the war because there was no precision bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">They, so it would have been pretty impossible really to, to hit the Nazis in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> without killing off all the Jews and it probably would not have really done very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">So my feeling was that the decision not to bomb <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> pursued because Roosevelt wanted, felt that the most important thing to do was to win the war as quickly as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">And all the resources https://collections.ushmm.org March 18, 2013 available probably was the right decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">And the exhibit implied differently but I think they have possibly adjusted this a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">I haven’t checked it out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1105">QUESTION:  What were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial? </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">Anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">Did you follow it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1108">ANSWER:  I did sure I did, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">I have done some work, some articles on war crimes tribunals and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Iam not particularly proud of the Eichmann trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">I think it did not follow the highest possible standards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">I think he got what was due him, needless to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">He was guilty as can be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">But I think the trial was not the most dignified and the, especially in the role of the prosecutor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">Ive forgotten his name now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">It was a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1117">QUESTION:  Hausner?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1118">ANSWER:  That’s correct, Hausner was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">Was, so I had some problems with that but basically of course, I think the Israelis were perfectly justified and legally justified in seizing him and trying him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">There was — I had no problem with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">It was interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">It sort of focused the attention of the world again on this issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">Until that time, don’t forget the issue of the Holocaust had sort of receded into the background. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">But it was the Eichmann trial that all of a sudden revived interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And ever since of course we have had tremendous output of scholarship, interest, movies, you name it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">The <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">Oral history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">Everything.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1131">ANSWER:  I think it’s great. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">I had some problems with the leadership at one point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">They organized a symposium on the Gypsies, the prosecution of the Gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And they did not invite me because I had written the only book in English on the subject but my position was that the Gypsies had not suffered as the Jews had suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">And I developed that in a fairly, a very carefully researched book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">I spent a year in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , collecting material. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">The official view at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> was because, that the Gypsies had been treated like Jews and deserved to be, that this was an instance of genocide and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">And the symposium was supposed to be focused on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">And they didn’t invite me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And an American Gypsy at that time was a member of the Holocaust https://collections.ushmm.org March 18, 2013 Council. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">And he was kind of a pseudo scholar who propagated that view that the Gypsies had suffered genocide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">And the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> bought it and I objected and I said it’s not a matter of my personal pride or my prestige to be at this symposium. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">But I think you are going on the wrong track and you should at least listen to my position. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">So they at last course invited me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">I gave a paper which was then published in the, in the series there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">I don’t know to what extent they have changed their view. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">They, another issue that I found problematic was the treatment of the Armenians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">I have written a book on that as one of my last books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">And again I did not, I concluded after careful research that while the Armenians suffered terribly and lost 40% of their people in massacres, it was not a state sponsored program of genocide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">And that too is not the conventional wisdom and apparently also was not the view of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">They occasionally have had exhibits on the Armenian genocide which I don’t accept. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">So I’ve had my differences with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , but I think basically of course they are doing very good work and it’s a very important institution.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1153">QUESTION:  Do you receive or did your parents receive reparations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1154">ANSWER:  Yes, they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">And I did too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">Not very much but it helps, every little bit helps. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">And we felt all of us, it was our due. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">That’s the least they could do, give us some money.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1166">ANSWER:  Probably not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">I probably should have talked with my parents more than I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">You know we all feel that way after our parents are gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">So I don’t think I have talked with them about this very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">My parents were fortunate that they came here at a time when it was https://collections.ushmm.org March 18, 2013 relatively easy to sink roots and get jobs and they did well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">Not every immigrant has had it, has had that fortune. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">So yes, I think they were quite happy to be here too.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1178">QUESTION:  Did they stay within the German Jewish circles?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1179">ANSWER:  Yes, very much so, very much so yes of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">That generation they did not, they did very little spreading out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">I mean I should qualify that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">Let’s say if someone came here as a physician from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and then got a license and practiced medicine he may have started to socialize with non-Jewish physicians and so forth or for other professions perhaps, just like I did in the academic scene in the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">But my parents’ generation, these people they stuck very much to themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">Yeah, my parents eventually retired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">They sold their <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and retired to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and had a nice retirement existence in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">They traveled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">They even visited in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> a little bit, were not anxious to be there, I think.</span></p>
